00:00:02 never let a good crisis go to waste winston churchill's famous words from the darkest days of world war
00:00:07 ii have taken on a more sinister meaning as the decades have passed this quote was actually meant to be an
00:00:11 inspirational message of hope to the british people but these days more cynical onlookers
00:00:16 see that people with ill intent can use a crisis just as well as those who are virtuous
00:00:21 the great reset is a collective name given to a series of economic policies that are attempting to use the recovery
00:00:26 from the coronavirus as a way to supposedly build a better brighter more sustainable future this
00:00:32 policy was first unveiled by the world economic forum and the united kingdom's prince charles and since this
00:00:36 announcement it has gathered support from a laundry list of economists politicians business people
00:00:42 and celebrities but it has also gathered a fair bit of criticism just 72 hours after its announcement a
00:00:47 petition to stop it gained 80 000 signatures which is kind of fair enough
00:00:53 the whole premise of this proposal does sound very ominous economic plans titled the great
00:00:59 something have not exactly had the best track record the fact that this plan is leveraging a
00:01:03 disaster alongside the fact that it is pushing some pretty spicy policies means that major conspiracy theories
00:01:09 have surfaced ranging from this plan will make us all poorer all the way up to this plan will make us
00:01:14 all slaves to the lizard people now in fairness the marketing around this great reset has not helped its case at
00:01:21 all if someone was to try and research what this plan actually was they would be presented with two
00:01:26 extremely bizarre ads that explain absolutely nothing and a two-hour panel which is extremely boring even to a
00:01:32 major economics nerd like myself and also kind of equally as unhelpful we know this because well
00:01:38 we had to research this plan to make this video so it sounds like some economics need to be explained
00:01:44 and to properly do this we're going to need to look at a few key questions what is the great reset actually
00:01:50 proposing to do do these ideas have any merit who are the players involved in pushing this agenda
00:01:58 and is this actually a nefarious scheme or just the victim of terrible marketing this episode of
00:02:04 economics explained was made possible by our fans on patreon if you would like to gain early access
00:02:08 to these videos before they're uploaded to youtube as well as participate in exclusive q a
00:02:12 sessions which are now held every saturday at 9 30 eastern standard time please consider supporting our channel
00:02:18 at patreon.com economics explained now perhaps one of the largest concerns shared amongst
00:02:24 rational onlookers to this great reset proposal is the distinct lack of support from economists time magazine has created a
00:02:30 page to help explain the idea and it's broken the proposal down into featurettes from its
00:02:35 key supporters these are models cellists reddit co-founders ex-royals but outside of claus schwab
00:02:43 the chairman of the world economic forum there are no economists for what it's worth class schwab is actually an
00:02:50 engineer by education but he is brilliant in his own right so that one's fair enough now a lot of this is
00:02:55 because people like prince harry and meghan markle are going to attract a lot more attention than people like paul
00:03:00 krugman or thomas piketty something something decline of society but you know what again that's fair
00:03:06 enough plenty of brilliant ideas make it nowhere because they fail to get any attention the second reason this page of
00:03:12 supporters is devoid of economists is because the great reset has for better or worse become more than
00:03:17 just an economic plan it has become a bloated wish list of things ranging from independent media to demilitarization
00:03:24 support for the arts to sustainable architecture which may very well be credible and important
00:03:29 arguments in their own right but only work to make this whole proposal more confusing
00:03:35 at best or more confronting at worst so for the sake of simplicity we're going to go ahead and ignore all the
00:03:40 fluff that has been tacked on and focus purely on the economic proposals because oh boy there are still a lot of them
00:03:49 but the foundational point of all of this is this single point so if you remember just one
00:03:54 thing from the great reset make sure it is this the great reset plans to ensure that every recovery stimulus
00:04:02 both fiscal and monetary from now on must include green conditions given that 2020 has been a very rocky
00:04:08 year and fiscal stimulus has been a major topic we have spoken about these policies many
00:04:12 many times on this channel we've explored infrastructure spending in China  just last week we looked at
00:04:17 quantitative easing in japan and the united states and a host of other policies from a diverse group of nations
00:04:22 one common theme we saw amongst all of this is that fiscal stimulus is a great opportunity to put money towards
00:04:27 something that needs to be improved in the nation if a country desperately needs new
00:04:32 highways more funding for schooling or you know what even a stronger military fiscal stimulus
00:04:37 is a great way to provide that spending the key objective of stimulus is to get money out into the economy
00:04:43 and into the hands of people that can go out and spend it that spending keeps businesses open
00:04:49 people employed and quality of life improving now pretty much any type of government spending will
00:04:55 achieve this core goal throwing money off the tallest building in a selection of major cities
00:05:00 will achieve this goal but there are alternatives that achieve the same core results while also having some happy little side effects
00:05:08 infrastructure spending is a great example of this we talked about it briefly in our last
00:05:12 video and i don't want to repeat too much but governments putting money towards building new pieces of infrastructure
00:05:18 will achieve their goal of getting money out into the economy in the form of paychecks to workers
00:05:23 contracts to builders and commissions to architects and engineers but they will also have something left
00:05:29 over to provide utility for decades to come what this great reset is proposing is something similar
00:05:34 but channeled exclusively towards building out infrastructure for green technologies there are a lot of
00:05:40 advantages to installing solar panels on your home so long as you live in a reasonably
00:05:44 sunny area it will reduce your energy bills to the point where the system will pay for itself a few times over
00:05:50 it also reduces your carbon footprint and may even add value to the property itself however the upfront cost is a
00:05:56 prohibitive hurdle for a lot of households similar situations exist on a nationwide level a modernized and expanded rail
00:06:03 network in a city like los angeles would work to take thousands of cars off the road reducing emissions congestions and
00:06:08 lost time for commuters but the upfront expense would probably take it out of consideration
00:06:14 however if a fraction of the two trillion dollars was rolled out in the initial wave of fiscal stimulus was
00:06:19 redirected towards a project like this the cost would be comparatively trivial while still achieving the desired
00:06:24 results of putting money into people's pocket during times of economic uncertainty now i'm not a city planner so this
00:06:30 example is exactly that and there probably is hundreds of better ways to spend this money on renewable infrastructure
00:06:36 but the point is that getting that money out there while redirecting it through a project like this or building a wind
00:06:41 farm or a fleet of electric buses or whatever is literally a win-win now you might be thinking well that sounds excellent
00:06:47 even the most staunch anti-environmentalists would agree that it's probably better to get
00:06:51 something for those government dollars than nothing at all right and well yeah it really is a great idea but there are problems
00:06:58 for starters it can be really slow to implement it's all well and good to say we will build some amazing new wind farm that
00:07:04 will power an entire city but there is a lot that goes into that plans have to be drawn up proposals need
00:07:09 to be accepted land needs to be procured turbines need to be manufactured
00:07:15 and only once all of this is done can tradesmen and labourers start getting paid to put this whole plan together
00:07:21 this could take years all the while people are losing jobs going hungry and not contributing to economic growth
00:07:27 say what you will about just giving people money but it is fast the second issue with this kind of
00:07:32 scheme is that money is channeled towards a group that may or may not need it as much as others a
00:07:38 typical project like let's say our wind farm will be handled through a corporation that specializes in these types of contracts
00:07:45 their goal will actually be to spend as little money as possible on labor because any money spent there is money
00:07:50 that isn't taken as profit and yeah sure that profit money will eventually find its way to
00:07:56 shareholders or be reinvested into the company itself but that is money that is not going to
00:08:00 be recirculated nearly as quickly as a 1200 check in the hands of a working class family the final problem is
00:08:07 what to do with the infrastructure once it's there it could be privatized in an attempt to recoup some of the expense of
00:08:13 building it in the first place but then a potential vital public service is in the hands of a private company
00:08:19 and any benefits it provides will be left behind a paywall of swords be it a toll for a highway higher
00:08:25 electricity costs or a more expensive ticket to ride on a train this is on top of the optics of
00:08:30 privatization which can sometimes be a little bit politically spicy of course the
00:08:34 alternative is just to keep the project as a public asset but then it's just another piece of
00:08:39 infrastructure that will need to be maintained on taxpayers dimes which could be unpopular to the people
00:08:45 that don't directly benefit from it a potential solution to at least half of these problems would be to have a
00:08:49 comprehensive list of projects pre-planned and ready to implement quickly after a downturn
00:08:55 complete with a plan for the project to cover its own costs or be shared equitably amongst taxpayers who will
00:08:59 fund it of course easier said than done but if governments did have the forward vision
00:09:05 to put some projects in the metaphorical chamber then you know what nobody would have any major problem with
00:09:10 this kind of strategy if the great reset was a challenge to governments to create these kinds of
00:09:14 plans and have them ready for the next downturn it would probably have a slightly more favorable reception
00:09:20 but advocating for doing this right now is just on an achievable goal for many people companies and economies
00:09:25 which are simply looking to survive through the next few months of course this proposal was one of just
00:09:31 many incorporated into the narrative of the great reset and the list is comprehensive and controversial
00:09:37 so let's see what else the fuss is all about now these are the takeaway issues that we were able to discern from the
00:09:44 articles published by the wef again probably one of the biggest issues with this whole proposal is that it's
00:09:49 just really hard to tell what the proposal is but i digress it's time for a speed round to get through
00:09:54 them all one point is to push for investment into technological education so that workers
00:09:59 around the world are better suited for employment in increasingly tech focused industries like logistics manufacturing
00:10:04 and retail and you know what fair enough that's probably a good call education is of
00:10:09 course something that i am very passionate about and making sure everyone has access to good applicable
00:10:15 knowledge is vital for maintaining a strong workforce so long as this education is directed
00:10:20 towards in-demand fields this is an investment that will pay dividends many times over on an individual
00:10:26 national and global level the next proposal is to encourage long-term investments by private sector
00:10:31 into sustainable industries and yeah this is a bit of a tough one certainly there are huge advantages to
00:10:36 carrying this out but it is market intervention so there will be critics
00:10:42 a carbon tax is an effective way to achieve what this point is proposing carbon emissions are what we call a
00:10:47 negative externality this is something that costs everybody in the wider economy regardless of if
00:10:53 they are benefiting from those emissions putting attacks on these emissions would mean that the external cost borne by society
00:10:59 is also a cost borne by the emitter and this money can either be collected as revenue to use on public goods so at
00:11:04 least the wider community is getting something for the medical price that they are paying
00:11:08 or in the best case scenario it will encourage businesses to invest into lower emitting alternatives to avoid
00:11:12 this cost altogether a large part of tesla's revenue currently comes from selling
00:11:18 unused allowances for emissions to companies that are less green in their operations now a good group of people would support
00:11:24 policies like this but many wouldn't so perhaps a more applicable takeaway
00:11:29 might be that governments don't need to subsidize solar farms or roll out carbon taxes just yet
00:11:36 but perhaps they should stop subsidizing major emitters that's like paying in actual dollars to
00:11:41 pay with intangible costs silly stuff and surprisingly a widespread problem
00:11:47 the next proposal is to roll out a new dashboard for measuring economic success beyond just gdp metrics and well you
00:11:52 know what no problem there either hey world economic forum i will lend you the
00:11:57 economics explained national leader board just give me a ticket to davos next year yeah
00:12:02 in all seriousness though no problems here gdp has its uses but it gets way more attention than it should
00:12:07 social metrics as well as things like an increase in collective net worth are sometimes far
00:12:12 more telling than gdp figures are alone the next point is to encourage entrepreneurs to establish new
00:12:17 technologies and environmentally ethical rules look this is nice in theory and full disclaimer believe it or not i am personally a big
00:12:27 supporter of protecting the environment by living below your means walking instead of driving recycling
00:12:34 all of that good stuff but it just isn't the role of business it's really the role of policymakers and the
00:12:40 responsibility of individuals businesses generate profit and keeping their motivations pure
00:12:46 and singular makes for better economies now if maintaining ethical environmental standards were baked into their profit motive
00:12:53 well that's great people love hearing about businesses that have neutral carbon footprints or
00:12:57 treat their employees well and those businesses get rewarded with conscientious dollars
00:13:02 a better solution to this would be to work on making consumers demand higher standards of corporations
00:13:07 and encouraging competition that could challenge companies that do not meet these standards
00:13:11 saying that companies should sit down and sing kumbaya with one another sounds nice in theory but in practice
00:13:17 they have duty to their shareholders you don't use a hammer to fix a laptop so just don't use corporations to
00:13:23 implement ethical regulation there are just better tools for the job now so far these policies have been a
00:13:29 bit optimistic but not exactly evil it would probably be difficult to see how people would think this is a
00:13:34 plan for world domination if it weren't for one final piece of the puzzle terrible marketing this is a direct
00:13:42 extract from the world economic forum's collaboration with time magazine on this issue in which the two organizations paint a
00:13:48 picture of a future world where the great reset has been implemented by all governments the year is 2023
00:13:55 the covert 19 pandemic has come to an end and the global economy is on a path to recovery
00:14:00 how did we get here the u.s began to change its approach after november 3rd 2020 when joe biden defeated donald
00:14:05 trump in the presidential election and the democrats held the majority in both houses of congress
00:14:10 following his inauguration in january 2021 biden moved quickly to rebuild frayed ties between america and europe
00:14:17 setting up a forum to share collective intelligence that could inform a smarter form of government
00:14:22 european governments who are eager to learn from investment strategies used by the us government like those led by
00:14:27 defence research agency darpa to spur research and development into high-risk technologies the european leadership used
00:14:33 challenge-orientated policies to create 100 carbon-neutral cities across the continent governments used a digital revolution to
00:14:40 improve public services from digital health to e-cards and create a citizen-centred welfare state
00:14:47 holy partisanship batman the article continues on like this and i will leave a link in the video description for
00:14:52 those who want to read it in full now you may personally support everything that has been said here and
00:14:56 that's great but you have to realize how blatantly partisan it is
00:15:01 it also pushes globalist ideas and advocating for nations to openly share their intellectual property
00:15:07 now this in reality is what people are taking issue with the world economic forum sounds like it
00:15:11 should be well a forum and one that positions itself above agendas like this one
00:15:18 but of course it isn't and understanding what the world economic forum actually is will teach us a lot about what this
00:15:22 whole proposal is in reality and why even the most staunch rivals to its policies
00:15:28 shouldn't be overly afraid of it the world economic forum is a non-government organization probably best known for their annual
00:15:35 meetings held in davos switzerland where thousands of wealthy people descend on a small alpine village to talk about
00:15:41 all things economics it makes a majority of its money through membership fees which are steep they range anywhere from
00:15:46 sixty seven thousand dollars a year to seven hundred thousand dollars per year depending on the level of engagement
00:15:52 with the organization so who are these members well obviously very rich people
00:15:57 or influential public figures that get complementary invites so by virtue of the fact that it
00:16:02 attracts the type of people who can afford this membership it is influential but it's not like the
00:16:08 united nations or the international monetary fund or the world bank as much as it would like you to believe
00:16:13 that it is it's for lack of a better way of putting it a book club for woke billionaires where
00:16:18 the only thing that they discuss are economics textbooks the great reset may as well be the great gatsby
00:16:25 it's not really a genuine proposal it's a hypothetical to stir up conversation and maybe a little bit of controversy
00:16:31 that's how they get attention which is how they get membership which is how they maintain
00:16:37 influence and relevance and now since i have totally destroyed my chances i've ever been invited to davos as a guest
00:16:42 speaker to bring this message to you all go and support the channel on patreon it might not make up for those sweet sweet
00:16:48 guest speaker dollar you do's but you will be continuing to make these videos possible just like these awesome
