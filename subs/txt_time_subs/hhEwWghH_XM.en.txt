00:00:01 the following is a conversation with ryan hall one of the most insightful minds and systems thinkers in the
00:00:06 martial arts world he's a black belt in jiu jitsu accomplished competitor
00:00:13 an mma fighter undefeated in the ufc and truly a philosopher who seeks to understand the underlying principles
00:00:20 of the martial arts jiu jitsu is such an important part of who i am and i was hoping to share that with
00:00:25 folks who might know me only as a researcher i think there's no better person to do that with than ryan who somehow
00:00:34 remarkably i can say is a friend and also a modern day warrior philosopher of the miyamoto masashi line
00:00:40 of especially dangerous and brilliant humans also his amazing wife jen hall was there as well so if you hear a kind
00:00:50 of voice of wisdom coming from above you know who it is quick summary of the sponsors power dot
00:00:56 babel and cash app please check out the sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast as a side
00:01:03 note let me say that renaming this podcast to just my name gave me intellectual freedom that i
00:01:10 really didn't anticipate was so empowering especially for someone who's trying to find their voice
00:01:16 i hope you'll allow me the chance to really try and do that to step outside of ai
00:01:22 and even science engineering history and so on and on occasion talk to athletes musicians
00:01:30 writers and maybe even comedians who inspire me especially up and coming comedians and musicians like eric weinstein
00:01:37 who yes we'll do a third conversation with soon i think if i allow myself to expand the
00:01:43 range of these conversations on occasion when i do return to science and engineering i'll bring a new perspective
00:01:50 and also a little bit more fun and a few extra listeners that may not otherwise realize how fascinating artificial
00:01:58 intelligence robotics mathematics and engineering truly is all that said please skip the episodes that don't
00:02:05 interest you you don't have to listen to all of them trust me as someone who is a bit or a
00:02:11 lot ocd that idea is quite unpleasant but life friends is full of unpleasant things
00:02:19 but as hunters thompson suggested and i suggest as well you should still buy the ticket and take
00:02:24 the ride if you enjoy this thing subscribe on youtube review it with 5 stars not a podcast

00:03:13 electrical muscle stimulation device in reading that bruce lee used it he was an inspiration to me as someone who
00:03:21 practices first principles thinking especially in a discipline where conventional thinking is everywhere
00:03:26 he created a martial art called jeet kune do that is in many ways at least philosophically in his hybrid
00:03:32 approach a precursor to modern day mixed martial arts there's a special kind of deep philosophical
00:03:37 thinking that combat athletes or jiu jitsu practitioners do that
00:03:42 is unlike any other i think it's grounded in the humbling process of getting your ass
00:03:47 kicked a lot that removes any illusion of intellectual superiority
00:03:52 i think the journey towards wisdom starts when you humbly admit to yourself that you know very little or almost nothing

00:04:28 song by vladimir vasotsky called anabolaf parisia that you'll start to understand if you sign up to babel
00:04:40 annabella this song always made me smile because it resonates with my own life
00:04:51 it translates loosely to she's been to paris paris for russian i suppose symbolizing a fancy life
00:04:57 and that the guy could never quite fit into that kind of life expensive things nice restaurants cars
00:05:01 all that i was thinking about what song's equivalent in english maybe
00:05:07 uptown girl by billy joe is similar in spirit but very different in style i just watched the video on youtube
00:05:14 for uptown girl and it's basically billy joel dressed up as a mechanic but dancing in a way that i'm pretty sure no mechanic
00:05:22 has ever danced turning the old cringe factor up to 11. anyway i always felt like i didn't
00:05:27 really fit in with the fancy people and that's what this song represents

00:07:17 people around the world and now here's my conversation with ryan hall who in your view is the greatest
00:07:25 warrior in history ancient or modern that's a tough question and
00:07:31 again i'm no historian by any measure so i'll probably do the worst like what are your best bands ever i'm
00:07:37 like metallica and you know so i'll pick the material could just come out with a new album by the way entire
00:07:42 orchestra that's that's kind of cool yeah them metallica will will always be one of the greatest yeah
00:07:47 i agree with that example if they were a well-known yet awesome band let me say it's like a nickelback
00:07:51 or something like that but i feel that feels cheap because everyone makes fun of nickelback yeah i
00:07:54 don't know i guess it depends on how you want to define warrior something to think about
00:08:00 when it comes to trying to evaluate various people or situations or things that i've read about or heard about are
00:08:07 with the circumstances that they were involved in because i think a lot of times it's easy to look at the outcomes
00:08:12 and obviously outcome we live in an outcome-driven world and you know outcomes do matter but at the same time
00:08:16 like  you know you look at let's say what cuba's been able to pull off
00:08:21 you know from a combat sports perspective it's it's staggering you know like the amount of
00:08:26 successful olympic level competitors they have in wrestling boxing judo i mean they're a tiny little island
00:08:32 with no money and no people it's that's shocking you know when you come you think about the olympics in the
00:08:37 united states doing well of course we should do well i mean russia should do well China  should do
00:08:41 well india should do better than they do honestly obviously it means like they're not into it as
00:08:45 much or at least certain sports because they have the resources people-wise so talent's not going to
00:08:49 be an issue so there's something to like where the starting point is like that's the
00:08:55 argument with like  what people say maradona i don't know if you're into it oh yeah big soccer okay
00:09:03 they say mardon is better than messi because he basically carried the team and and won the world cup with the team that
00:09:08 wouldn't otherwise win the world cup and then messi was only successful in barcelona because 
00:09:16 he has like superstars he's playing with other superstars right yeah that's fair to say i mean
00:09:20 like like united there's a lot of factors that go into let's say winning a winning a soccer game and you know
00:09:24 obviously barcelona you know particularly for various points in time had a
00:09:29 ridiculous all-star squad of world-class players but and i you know let's say for instance
00:09:32 maybe they didn't have the creative players in argentina they needed to get the ball up to messi
00:09:37 you know they didn't have like the nes the and you know the you know the again the backing there in
00:09:42 the midfield but because obviously argentina's always had ridiculous attacking players like even
00:09:46 alongside messi but they're like the three killers up front and then a little less behind so it's interesting
00:09:52 you say that it depends how you define warrior because you can probably take like
00:09:58 some of the civil rights leaders you can go into that direction like leaders in general but if we just look at like the greatest
00:10:03 martial artist in history in that direction do you have somebody in mind i would say at least three
00:10:09 three that pop into my head and would be  hannibal alexander the great and then maybe miyamoto musashi you know the
00:10:17 two commanders and then one you know guy but  so it's it's interesting and then
00:10:23 again you mentioned warriors being able to make a lot out of a little  you know musashi's famous for winning
00:10:28 duels you know that were oftentimes one there were one-on-one you know the alexander
00:10:34 and hannibal were you know military commanders and one of them faced rome and that was an interesting thing
00:10:39 oftentimes you know coming up with novel tactics different strategies sometimes under resourced doing having to do novel and crazy
00:10:46 things there's skin in the game that's an interesting thing too i think a lot of times you know it's 
00:10:50 if you're playing a video game i don't think you can be a warrior because there's there's no skin in the game you get hurt
00:10:56 you lose and it's a bummer it stings a little bit maybe it makes you feel slightly disappointed but 
00:11:02 you know musashi loses he loses hannibal loses he loses alexander loses he loses and they
00:11:07 lose i guess the people around them lose so that's almost like  you could use even from a combat sports
00:11:13 perspective a muhammad ali i mean you consider also their quality of opposition musashi was fighting high quality opposition
00:11:19 obviously hannibal and al alexander particularly hannibal were fighting unbelievable opposition
00:11:24 muhammad ali fought phenomenal opposition but he had skin in the game both in the ring and out
00:11:28 and that actually meshes with as you mentioned like a civil rights you know type of situation where
00:11:33 you are under resourced you're pushing the stone uphill and that was a neat thing i think about
00:11:38 muhammad ali was how much you know personal conviction the man had to have in order to pull off
00:11:43 what he was able to pull off both in in and outside of the ring and that reminds me of
00:11:47 of again some of the other great leaders or great fighters throughout history so what do you make of
00:11:53 the kind of very difficult idea that some of these conquerors like alexander the great
00:11:59 and somebody that  if you listen to hardcore history oh dan carlin  who apparently elon
00:12:05 musk is also a big fan of is the genghis khan episode you know a large
00:12:16 percent of the world is  is  we can call genghis khan an ancestor so the difficult truth is about some of
00:12:25 these conquerors is that there's a lot of murder and rape and pillage and stealing of
00:12:32 resources and all that kind of stuff and yet they're often remembered as quite honorable i mean in the case of
00:12:39 genghis khan there's a lot of people who argue if you look at the historically the way it's described in
00:12:45 full context is he was ultimately like a given the time he was a liberator he was 
00:12:56 he was a progressive i should say  you know like in terms of the the violence and the atrocities he committed
00:13:04 he at least in the stories has always provided the option of not to do that it's only if you
00:13:10 resist do you basically have the option do you want to join us or do you want to die
00:13:17 and die horribly and so that's the progressive sort of  that's the bernie sanders of the era
00:13:24 nice so  what do you make of that that there's just so much of these great conquerors there's so much
00:13:32 murder that to us now would just seem insane it's funny you mentioned it i think that maybe it's a human
00:13:38 nature thing that we want to  or you know maybe or maybe a misunderstanding thing that we
00:13:43 want to cast all of our characters and ourselves maybe as entirely good or as entirely negative
00:13:49 when you know i guess i was the phrase or the saying you know one man's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist
00:13:56 is accurate and a lot of times i think you can understand as long as you're able to look from various people's
00:14:01 perspective like if you look at the tv show the wire which was obviously you know widely everybody
00:14:05 loves the wire i thought that they were everyone i mean i'm not saying anything that's
00:14:10 that's not been said before compelling characters from all angles whether you like the character
00:14:13 dislike the character you were able to understand the motivations of people doing various things even if they did
00:14:19 wrongly they did rightly you know we want to cast all of the the demons throughout history as as
00:14:26 completely inhuman when i think that makes it difficult for us to understand them and we want to look
00:14:31 back at at the people that we think of as great and entirely great and i think that
00:14:35 we're you know we're experiencing the problems with this you know even right now socially and politically as
00:14:40 we're trying to look back and decide the people we thought were good or not good or people we thought were bad and now good
00:14:45 rather than going hey there's there's good and bad to all things and there are as you mentioned the genghis khan thing
00:14:52 you don't have to fight back you do i respect you for it but then we're gonna have a conflict and then
00:14:56 we'll see what happens and if you lose you're going to be sorry that you did because i have to make it that way if i
00:15:01 want to continue utilizing this this kind of mo because i need to discourage the next
00:15:06 guy from doing what you're doing right now and ultimately though i guess that's an interesting thing imagine you put every
00:15:13 single person on planet earth in a cage crime drops you know  all sorts there are certain positives to that
00:15:22 and i it's just things are as they are it's difficult but that is ultimately more the law of the jungle and i think
00:15:26 that we're able to supersede some of that now in modern times and i think we're fortunate but as you mentioned we look back and
00:15:33 say oh this is horrible say no that that just is what it is that's how life
00:15:39 is at a base level and you know again if you're a lion and i'm a gazelle i don't i don't really like it very much but we
00:15:44 don't call the lion the bad guy we don't sanctify the gazelle or the other way around so it's just it's
00:15:50 interesting when you pull back some of the controls that we put on our behavior and you know in modern life
00:15:55 which i think are generally speaking positive you know we get down to how things often are and
00:16:03 at the same time we could modern life was built by people like genghis khan so then you get down to the ends just to
00:16:10 find the means it's a tough question these aren't things with easy answers at least if they are i certainly don't have the
00:16:14 the smarts to figure out the answers to them but  it's it's difficult i would just say
00:16:20 people in the world are complicated and layered and depending upon which side of the line you're standing on at various times
00:16:26 you know you may like or dislike someone but i can't remember  it's i can't remember who's whose idea
00:16:31 was this is killing me but it's the veil of ignorance i guess the philosophical you know you
00:16:36 know idea of the veil of ignorance where i go is is sticking everyone in the cage the
00:16:41 right thing to do when i say or everyone but me and i say well no why well it would make my life easier
00:16:45 if i just went over and took all of your stuff as long as you couldn't stop me i mean of course that's a great idea
00:16:50 that's what everyone does in every video game but  in skyrim you steal stuff when people aren't around
00:16:56 but ultimately you go well this isn't the right thing to do because if i were on the other side of it
00:17:00 i would i would not appreciate it it's it's inherently not a good thing to do i'm only doing it because i think i'm
00:17:06 going to win and that's a fine way to be but you don't have the white hat on i guess i would say so
00:17:11 i think without those philosophical underpinnings to reign us in you know i guess morally speaking it's
00:17:17 very difficult to say what's right or wrong and you'd say certain actions have a
00:17:21 reaction almost like a physics sense if you kill everyone in your way for as long as you're able to
00:17:28 your life will be easier i mean you're setting the table for someone doing the same to you when you're no longer the
00:17:31 tough guy but it is what it is yeah if you look at like the instagram channel
00:17:38 nature's metal it hurts my heart to watch to remind me a comfortable descendant of ape how vicious nature is
00:17:50 just unapologetically  just i mean there's a there's a process to it
00:17:58 where the bad guy always wins the the violence is the solution to most problems or
00:18:07 the flip side of that running away from violence is the solution depending on your skill set
00:18:12 and it's funny to think of us humans with our extra little piece of brain that we're somehow trying
00:18:17 to figure out like you said in the philosophical way how to supersede that how to like move
00:18:24 past the viciousness the cruelty the just the cold exchange of nature but perhaps it's not so
00:18:34 maybe that is nature maybe that's the way of life maybe we're trying too hard to  we're being too
00:18:43 egotistical and thinking we're somehow separate from nature we're somehow distant from that very thing
00:18:47 i couldn't agree with him more in fact i think actually orson scott card you know who's the writer of a great book called
00:18:52 anders game was this was a statement that the main character
00:18:58 you know ender  made in the book his brother was brilliant his brother was like kind
00:19:04 of sociopathic brilliant kid that was ended up kicked out of the school that they were all into for
00:19:07 battle commander dealing with his brother taught him that ultimately strength courage
00:19:13 the ability to do violence for all the good and the bad of that is one of the fundamental most important
00:19:18 things to be able to do in life because if you can't cause destruction if you can't cause pain
00:19:22 you will be forever subject to those who can and i think that you mentioned egotism i think that that's a disease
00:19:27 that could obviously strike any of us but it's something that we're looking at now we're
00:19:31 you know i think we should be unbelievably thankful as people that live in the world that we do that we can
00:19:37 walk down the street without having to worry that i'm like well don't worry that that six foot six
00:19:43 270 pound person over there is just gonna leave me alone and i have a rolex on but whatever
00:19:48 i'll be fine because that person's deciding to leave me alone because we've all agreed to live in this relatively
00:19:53 you know sane and or you know constrained society because it benefits all of us and we're doing it because of
00:19:59 a philosophical underpinning not because nature dictates it be that way because nature dictates it go in a
00:20:03 very very different direction and the only person the only thing stopping that person from doing something to me
00:20:10 is either me that person or someone else that will stand in between us and if i can't do it and there's no one
00:20:14 there to stand in between us then the only thing stopping that person is that person and i have to hope that they're
00:20:21 either disinterested or disinclined to do that sort of thing and i think that  you know it's keeping in mind that that
00:20:27 that is the fundamental nature of the world whether we like it or not um
00:20:33 is important and i think the the quest to fundamentally alter human nature is going to be ultimately fruitless and
00:20:38 then also it's it is a little bit egotistical the lion does what a lion does
00:20:43 you know we we can try to box it in and we can try to you know guide this direction that direction but
00:20:48 you know nature is as it is and as it always will be unless we want to start to
00:20:54 constrain it significantly but now i'm starting to get into individual rights who put me in charge who says that i
00:20:59 should be the one to make the choice is constraining because many of the most awful things that have happened
00:21:04 throughout history one group or one person has decided to constrain others and we don't like genghis khan doing
00:21:11 that well i'll do that on a little level are there going to be beneficial benefits and beneficiaries absolutely but
00:21:16 there'll be losers in that too so i guess it's a it's a dangerous game it's almost like putting on the one ring you
00:21:20 know we remember when frodo offered the one ring to gandalf and gandalf said no no i would take it
00:21:25 away i would put it on i would use it out of the desire to do good but through me it would wheel the
00:21:30 power so terrible you can't imagine i think that's that's the big question for anyone that decides
00:21:36 that's able to have reach and able to have power i mean obviously i can't speak to that
00:21:40 but imagine you did have national level global level power how would you use it
00:21:46 would you try to change the world would you be glad that you did down the line i don't know yeah there's  i mean
00:21:52 that's the thing we're struggling now as a society maybe it'd be nice to get your quick comment on that which is the
00:21:58 people who have traditionally been powerless are now you know seeking a fairer society a more
00:22:08 equal society and in in attaining more power justly there's also
00:22:16 a realization at least from my perspective that power corrupts everyone even if you're
00:22:24 even if the flag you wave is that of of justice right and so you know not to overuse the term
00:22:33 but it'd be nice if you have thoughts about the whole idea of cancer culture and
00:22:40 the internet and and twitter and so on where there's on nuance difficult discussions of 
00:22:49 of race of gender of fairness equality justice all these kinds of things
00:22:56 there's a shouting down oftentimes of nuanced discussion of kind of trying to
00:23:04 reason through these very difficult issues through our history through what our future looks like
00:23:09 do you have thoughts about the internet discourse that's going on now is there something positive yeah i mean
00:23:15 we can pull out of this it's an interesting thing to see i guess as you mentioned
00:23:22 anytime you're wielding power whomever you are doing so carefully is is important and
00:23:27 it's very very easy to look at the people that have power and that are using it poorly or have
00:23:32 used it poorly and go hey you're the bad guy and then go well of course if i had power i'll use it properly and i may
00:23:38 intend to use it properly and maybe i will but at the same time we see a lot of times people are people are
00:23:47 people i think that a lot of the i think if you if you believe that that
00:23:53 human beings are all one which i do you know no matter whether you're here you're there you're you're
00:23:57 you got two arms two legs a heart a brain if we all live a similar experience you know and obviously with variations
00:24:04 on a theme but  you know you're no less a human being if you're a person i've never met from
00:24:09 China  than than some person in virginia it's we're all we're all people and i guess
00:24:15 ultimately if i believe that human beings are corruptable and that power corrupts and that we're all fallible and
00:24:19 we say and do things that either intentionally or unintentionally
00:24:26 that we wish we'd not i think that i have to allow for a space i guess with the word it's almost
00:24:32 a religious term but i guess i would just say grace and that's something that i see
00:24:37 disappearing from discourse in the public or maybe it wasn't there i'm not sure but it's interesting you know
00:24:41 watching this occur on the internet because also now no longer are you and i just having a talk
00:24:46 sitting on a on a bus stop it's now in writing everything's in writing the old the old
00:24:51 saying like don't put that in writing you're like don't put anything in writing that's how you get in trouble
00:24:56 and basically  you know with with the degree to which everything is recorded but recorded in tiny little bytes it's
00:25:01 very very easy for me to wave every less little foolish ignorant incorrect or correct thing
00:25:06 that someone has ever said or done in their face to support whatever argument that i'm trying to make about
00:25:11 them or a situation and i think that you mentioned cancel culture or
00:25:16 you know as it seems to exist obviously this is poisonous on its face this is poisonous it's it's the sort of thing that
00:25:22 doesn't incentivize proper behavior i mean you look at let's say one of the great monsters
00:25:29 of history adolf hitler obviously who's done awful awful things but also for anyone that's even a minor student of history
00:25:35 did some positive things as well we don't have to i don't have to embroider this person's crimes i don't
00:25:40 have to act as if there was nothing good a monster has ever done and
00:25:46 nothing bad that that a great person throughout history has ever done but imagine the ghost of adolf hitler
00:25:50 were to pop up and go oh my gosh guys i'm so sorry i i know what i've done
00:25:55 but i'd like to apologize and start to make it right well i mean you'd hope that you
00:25:59 you know if he popped up over here you go well i don't really like what you've done and i don't like you but at the same
00:26:04 time i'm glad to hear that you're attempting to make this right and push in a positive
00:26:07 direction even if you can't make it right because otherwise what am i doing i'm disincentivizing
00:26:12 change for the better i'm i'm looking to wield whatever power i have in a punitive fashion
00:26:19 which does not encourage people to do anything other than double down on on the wrongs that they've made
00:26:23 knowing that at least they're going to have some support from the people that support
00:26:28 that and i guess i want to you you hopefully look at the use of the internet as a tool that can
00:26:34 educate and i guess i don't like the word empower but empower people to do various things extend their reach
00:26:40 but  but educate and learn rather than to further solidify little tribal things that exist which i
00:26:45 think everyone in humanity and human history is is vulnerable to me look at the course of human history it's
00:26:50 deeply tribal and the tribes or the groups that have been on top at various points in time
00:26:55 have done a lot of times bad things to the ones that have not and
00:26:59 you'd hope that we could learn lessons from the past and rather than you know committing the crimes that were
00:27:04 you know that were committed against us recommitting them when we slide into the top position
00:27:11 say you know i could do this now but i'll not you know i understand the urge to to seek vengeance is strong of anyone
00:27:16 that says differently i don't i wouldn't trust you know but at the same time we go i've we we have enough experience in history
00:27:23 enough experience in life enough hopefully wisdom you know time in to go this isn't the right answer
00:27:29 this is only going to replay the things the the worst parts of our history not the best
00:27:33 and i want to encourage positive behavior and if i just again further lash out at people
00:27:38 although understandably done done understandably i'm simply just going to just perpetuate the cycle
00:27:44 that's gone on to this point so you hope that even though we're seeing a lot of a lot of turmoil
00:27:49 societally at the moment and globally at the moment that  i guess our better angels can prevail at
00:27:54 a certain point but it's going to take a great deal of leadership and i think that we're
00:27:58 we're sorely missing like a martin luther king style character at the moment or a great leader
00:28:04 and i just i'm hoping that one will show up for sure and by the way a word i don't hear often and i think it's a beautiful
00:28:10 one which is grace that's a really interesting word i'm gonna have to think about that it is
00:28:15 there is a religious component to it but it's exactly right it you have to somehow walk the line
00:28:24 between you know you mentioned hitler i've been reading  the rise and fall of the third reich
00:28:32 i'm really thinking about the 1930s and what it's like to have economic my concern is the economic pain that
00:28:41 people are feeling now quietly is really a suffering that's not being heard and there's
00:28:48 echoes of that in the in the 20s and the 30s with the great depression
00:28:54 and there's a hunger for a charismatic leader like you said there's a leader that could walk with grace could inspire
00:29:02 could  could bring people together with  with sort of 
00:29:08 dreams of a better future that's positive but hitler did exactly everything that i just said except for the word positive
00:29:18 which is he did give a dream to the german people who were great people who are great people of um
00:29:27 of a better future it's just that a certain point that quickly turned into the better future requires
00:29:38 literally expansion of more land it started with well if we want to build a great germany
00:29:45 we need a little bit more land and so we need to kind of get austria then we need to kind of get
00:29:54 france mostly because france doesn't understand that more land is really useful so we need to get rid of them and
00:29:59 look what they did to us in versailles anyway but so the jew the jewish  the holocaust is a separate
00:30:12 thing i don't know well i don't know i don't know what to think about because  so me being jewish and having
00:30:21 the echoes of the suffering is in my family or the people that are lost i don't know because hitler wrote all about it in
00:30:29 mineconf so i don't know if the evil he committed was there all along i mean and that that's where the
00:30:36 question of forgiveness i mean hitler's such a difficult person to talk about but it's the question of
00:30:44 on cancer culture who is deserving of forgiveness and who's not
00:30:50 like the holocaust survivors that i've read about that i've heard the interviews with
00:30:57 they've often spoken about the fact that the way for them to let go to overcome the atrocities that they've experienced
00:31:08 is to forgive like forgiveness is the way out for them it's interesting to think about i don't know i don't know if
00:31:16 i don't know if we're even a society ready to even contemplate an idea of forgiveness for hitler it's
00:31:22 it's an interesting idea though it was it's a good thought exercise at the very least
00:31:29 to think about like all these people that are being canceled for doing bad things of different degrees
00:31:36 think of like louis ck or somebody like that for being not a good person but like what is the
00:31:42 path for forgiveness so what's a good person what is the good part if that's a sliding scale
00:31:48 that we could all find ourselves looking at the uncomfortable end of a gun on you know
00:31:52 particularly down the line i mean you hope for the best but these definitions i guess like you said
00:31:57 are important and who's doing the canceling who's being canceled i'm not necessarily as you said
00:32:02 saying that that's entirely unjustified or certainly not it's certainly understandable and
00:32:06 particularly you mentioned like a monster like an adolf hitler but it's also interesting i couldn't help but
00:32:10 notice like you mentioned as a society us being able to apply forgiveness to someone who's
00:32:16 done so much horror but people who are personal i'm of course many so many people in person
00:32:21 affected but directly personally affected someone a survivor of the holocaust being able to let go on that i'm nowhere
00:32:27 near big enough a person for that sort of thing but i guess that's that's an interesting thing
00:32:34 you know being the person who was physically there potentially able to able to let go
00:32:40 i don't know that's that's unbelievably powerful it's interesting i guess you have to wonder sometimes
00:32:45 and this isn't obviously in regards to that to the holocaust but why why i'm holding on to various things
00:32:50 am i what is it doing for me and what is it doing to me is it facilitative is it not
00:32:56 and i guess that's something else that i i really enjoy when i was on ultimate fighter they  they don't let you have any
00:33:02 music or any books other than religious text so i brought a bible and i brought a quran and i started to read them
00:33:07 side by side and it was it was really interesting reading the bible's a little drier quran's the crown is more interesting at
00:33:12 least written but i i think something that that was consistently brought up 
00:33:19 was the way the most merciful people want i don't think any of us want justice
00:33:24 we think we want justice but i don't think we want justice justice is a dangerous dangerous dangerous game
00:33:29 because maybe this person's wronged me deeply and i i want justice i want to balance it out because what is justice
00:33:34 is not a balancing of the scales and sometimes you can understand it on a societal level i think it's fine i mean there's
00:33:39 crime and punishment we can go for the benefits and the drawbacks of that but i think what any of us want is mercy
00:33:45 within reason you know grace as you mentioned because justice is a very very very dangerous thing
00:33:51 and it's a valuable and important thing but who gets to decide what's just what justice is actually meted out maybe
00:33:57 i get to meet out justice but it's not i don't get my comeuppance well that sounds great but what happens when it's
00:34:02 pointed back at me and  i guess that comes back to the veil of ignorance
00:34:07 you know the idea that that one day i will have to live in the world in which i've envisioned
00:34:11 the world in which i've created i i think that a lot of times people love the idea of 
00:34:17 they're a judge for your crimes and a lawyer for theirs and i heard that the other day i thought it
00:34:22 was great and  i think that's it that's a dangerous thing and hopefully it gives
00:34:26 us all pause before rightly or wrongly but always understandably you know wielding wielding
00:34:32 serious power yeah justice is a kind of drug so if you look at history also been reading a lot about stalin i
00:34:37 mean all those folks really i don't know i don't know what was inside hitler's head actually
00:34:44 that he's a tricky one because i think he was legitimately insane stalin was not
00:34:52 and stalin was like he literally thought he's doing a good thing he literally thought for the
00:34:58 entirety of the time that communism is going to bring like that's the utopia
00:35:06 and he's going to create a happy world and in his in his mind were ideas of justice of fairness of happiness of of 
00:35:20 yeah human flourishing and that's that's a drug and it somehow sadly pollutes the mind
00:35:25 when you start thinking like that what's good for society and believing that you have a good sense
00:35:32 of what's good for society that's intoxicating especially when others around you are feeling the same way
00:35:39 and then you start like building up this movement and you forget that you are just like a you're you're like
00:35:47 barely recently evolved from an ape like you don't know what the hell you're doing and then you start like killing witches
00:35:52 or whatever like you start you start doing they did math let's be honest though i mean sometimes you got a
00:35:56 witch has to go yeah we can all agree there which which has to go if
00:36:02 if it floats or sinks which one i forget which which whichever one we need at the time
00:36:05 honestly it's floating it should have sunk  yeah but yeah we can definitely agree that we just have to go
00:36:14 because you brought it up i  tweeted recently but also just i'm one of the things i'm
00:36:21 really ashamed of in my life is i haven't really read almost any of the sci-fi classics
00:36:27 really yeah so like i my whole journey through reading was through like the
00:36:34 literary philosophers that would say like camus jesse dostoevsky kafka like that place like that's a kind
00:36:42 of sci-fi world it creates a world in which the the deepest questions about human nature
00:36:55 can be explored i didn't realize this but the sci-fi world is the same it just puts it in a
00:37:02 it like removes it from any kind of historical context where you can explore those same ideas
00:37:08 in like space somewhere elsewhere in a different time a different place it allows you almost like more freedom
00:37:14 to like construct these artificial things where you can just do crazy  crazy kind of human experiments so
00:37:20 i'm now working through it  the books on my list are the foundation series by isaac asimov
00:37:31 dune snow crash by neil stephenson and ender's game like you mentioned
00:37:37 that's just kind of and then so i posted that and then of course like elon musk john  carmack i don't know
00:37:43 if you know him creator of doom and quake oh cool so see they all pitched in these nerds these ultra nerds just started like
00:37:50 going like did these  do you need to read this that and and the other so
00:37:56 i've like started working out okay but it seems like the list i've mentioned holds up somewhat is there a book is there
00:38:06 sci-fi books or series or authors that that you find are just amazing maybe another way to
00:38:13 ask that is like what's the greatest sci-fi book of all time well i'd like to start by
00:38:19 sharing something that i i'm embarrassed about is that i haven't read anything other than  you know orson scott card
00:38:28 j.r tolkien  frank herbert tolkien yeah dude yep yeah yeah i'm aware through wikipedia
00:38:34 and  through through surface reading of things that like a book called the republic was written once
00:38:39 yeah there were some other motherboards you're  a prolific reader of wikipedia articles well
00:38:49  whatever else it is that i waste my time on but but yeah so i also i should say i posted on reddit questions
00:38:57 for  ryan hall and there's like a million questions but like  half of them have to do with
00:39:02 dune no not really but like people bring up doom i don't understand why i did you mentioned doom before
00:39:07 well i actually actually have a showy roll actually made us a ghee a dune themed ghee one time which i thought was
00:39:13 kind of cool i'll send you i'll give you one we got extras but  actually to your to your point
00:39:18 actually this is a orson scott card quote actually the writer of bender's game fiction because it's not about
00:39:23 somebody who actually lived in the real world always has the possibility of being about oneself
00:39:28 and i think that's a neat thing because i i have heard you know other very people whom i respect and
00:39:33 very sharp people actually every now and then dig their heels and go i don't like fiction i only
00:39:37 like non-fiction it's more it's more instructive and i would go i completely disagree with that i think
00:39:42 we have a hard enough time figuring out what happened at 7 11 three hours ago that let me tell you
00:39:46 what happened 600 years bc i'm like hey i'm interested but don't tell me this isn't a story too
00:39:52 yeah there's a there's there's actu there's factual components i have no doubt but we struggle sometimes to like i
00:39:58 guess what i like about fiction is that you can tell me a story it's all about people
00:40:03 i mean every night there's more and less believable things and i think dune would be an unbelievably well written
00:40:09 in my opinion for to run you know what do i know but i really like doing i'll say that
00:40:13  well-written example of you know human beings interacting with one another the
00:40:17 political component to that the emotional the intellectual the relationship components all of that
00:40:23 and  i i think that dune is neat because it's a sci-fi novel but only in the only in the loosest sense it's it's
00:40:28 really a story about religion about group dynamics about human potential
00:40:36 about belief learning politics governance ecology it's  the best stories remind me
00:40:44 of history the same way history hopefully is not just a a list of facts that i try to be able to recall
00:40:52 or factoids that i try to recall but a story that i can understand and and see how how the threads of
00:40:58 time kind of came together and created certain things and a lot of times like we say i'm like  how the heck is
00:41:03 what's going on right now or a hundred years from now or a hundred years in the past happened
00:41:06 and you can look back far enough if we had accurate knowledge if we had that like that hypothetical
00:41:11 perfect pool shot you know at the beginning of time we would see an unbroken chain of events that led us to
00:41:16 where we are and and where we are will potentially lead us to where we're going which is
00:41:20 again why hindsight's helpful but i think it's neat like i guess i really enjoy for instance a
00:41:24 book like dune and they're actually making a movie out of it which i'm i'm skeptical of to be honest because
00:41:29 it's it's going to be difficult to bring that to the screen for a variety of reasons but
00:41:34 there's at least 100 questions ask ryan what do you think's about the new dune movie i am not enough of an authority to
00:41:39 have any sort of decent opinion but i guess what i would say is so much of it goes on in the character's mind like how
00:41:43 much of any of our day is any lived experience as it were is internal
00:41:49 the majority how many times are people walking around and you know they can you could like hey what do you see right now i'm
00:41:54 like oh well i see this picture i see a wall hey there's lex but really what what i was paying
00:41:59 attention to was what was going on inside of my head for a moment and almost the rest of the world
00:42:05 tuned out and kind of dimmed and  yeah i guess that i think that's going to be a struggle to
00:42:10 to any time you want to bring that type of a written story to to a visual medium i think it's going to
00:42:15 be more difficult but it'll it'll be interesting it's definitely my one of my favorite stories
00:42:20 and it's been it's honestly helped me become better at life in my opinion better the martial arts
00:42:25 and i think the the writer i think frank herbert was absolutely brilliant whether those were all his ideas which in
00:42:30 reality none of us or all of our good ideas aren't ours we're a combination maybe came up with something you're a
00:42:35 curator of other good ideas and some things you borrowed from somewhere without even realizing it but 
00:42:40 i think the the way the messages and the themes and the ideas that were conveyed particularly in the original novel or just
00:42:47 absolutely brilliant is that the is that to you one of the greats and and the flip side
00:42:52 of that like or another way to ask that is like if somebody's new to sci-fi is that
00:42:56 something you would recommend that that is an entry point i'm not well read enough in this sci-fi world i
00:43:01 haven't written a lot of like isaac asimov or anything like that but i just i'll recommend dune i'll be an
00:43:07 obnoxious like evangelist for dune to anyone who'll listen okay so i yeah i would strongly
00:43:11 recommend it so the other thing you mentioned now i should probably be talking to you about much more important things but
00:43:19 the other thing you mentioned is skyrim  do you play video games what's your favorite game what's
00:43:24 what would you say is the greatest video game of all time because i'm a huge fan of elder scrolls oh
00:43:29 yeah i mean i play a little bit at this point you know a little little less  finally
00:43:34 moved into a new house so you're like an adult no no no no i'm like a better funded 12 year old
00:43:42 yeah that's yeah that's entirely that's entirely accurate better funded 12 year old but somewhat better funded
00:43:48 12-year-old not as well-funded as i wish but historically did you play video games oh yeah i played as a kid i was
00:43:53 you know again i've always liked playing sports and and liked reading and i always enjoy video games but my
00:43:57 favorite video game i think i've ever played was  nicely the old republic it was a star
00:44:03 wars game a huge star wars fan until it became less so so recently disney you don't like the i haven't watched
00:44:10 it yet oh my my delorean oh dog oh i actually like mandalorian that was that was actually
00:44:14 pretty good yeah waving this off yeah yeah i will if i could cancel
00:44:20 one thing i would cancel disney store i'm gonna edit that part out okay let's go to the next
00:44:25 but  this is where if people are wondering if you're watching this on youtube and like the dislike amount is like 80
00:44:32 percent it's because of that comment so good job good job for making the internet hey nothing now what about
00:44:40  baby yoda yeah i guess like he's little he's got ears and he uses the force sometimes and he passes
00:44:44 out again no qualms with baby yoda yeah you don't have a heart okay
00:44:53 i the let's go to jiu jitsu if it's okay  so the audience of this podcast may not know much about jiu jitsu or they do
00:45:01 because it's really part of the culture now but they don't really know much they see that so many
00:45:07 people have fallen in love with it have been transformed through it but they don't know much about like
00:45:11 what is this thing is there a way you could sort of try to explain the what is jiu jitsu
00:45:17 what is the essence of this martial art that's captured the minds and hearts of so many people in the world
00:45:25 i think that jiu jitsu is is a philosophy that's expressed physically and that it's the kind of development of the in mental
00:45:36 capacity and physical capacity working in unison to  move efficiently and
00:45:47 almost flowingly unresistantly with with a given situation with a with or physically resisting opponent
00:45:55 learning how to generate force on your own and how to steal force from the floor how to steal force from the other
00:46:01 person and move in concert with it as opposed to clash against which if you watch two untrained people fight it's almost
00:46:06 entirely a clash it's a runaway and clash or run away and clash if you watch jiu jitsu done well
00:46:14 it's it looks like water moving around a solid structure and and i think that that is expressed
00:46:19 physically and i think that all of the things that anyone have really been able to do very very well in jiu jitsu end up
00:46:27 kind of exemplifying that but i think that's true of martial arts in general i think that a lot of times like the
00:46:32 clashing that we see going on and working well is just the fact that you know you get
00:46:38 very very physically powerful people every now and then they're able to get away with this but i don't think that
00:46:42 that's and that's that's fantastic because ultimately it's a results-driven thing but
00:46:46 i think that the essence of the martial arts is learning how to make more out of less and how to move with
00:46:51 and be yielding almost like real life aikido and  so you think of martial arts  jiu jitsu
00:46:59 as  like water or flowing so aikido so moving around the the force as opposed to
00:47:11 sort of maybe the wrestling mindset is finding a leverage where you can apply an exceptional amount of force
00:47:17 so like it's like maximizing the application of force i guess maybe that's a better way to i'd like to marry
00:47:22 the two ideas you know because i think you flow until the point at which you are the greater force at which point
00:47:27 in time you can apply but  if you look at the best wrestlers and when i say best i don't necessarily
00:47:32 mean most successful although of course most successful are always very very good throughout the course of history in
00:47:38 boxing in wrestling in judo they're magical they they disappear and reappear it's
00:47:45 like fighting a ghost that that is like incorporeal when you want to find it but then when you don't want to
00:47:49 find it when you don't want to find it it finds you and i i think that we see that
00:47:55 in the like the bouvie source citatives of wrestling and you know i guess you could look
00:48:01 at  floyd mayweather or willie pep or you know pernell whitaker in boxing as brilliant examples of
00:48:09 disappearing and reappearing and when you're strong it's almost like gorilla warfare when you're strong i'm nowhere to be
00:48:15 found when you're weak you can't get rid of me and i think that's what we're looking
00:48:18 for yeah the tear brothers are incredible at that they just they they look like  skinny starbucks baristas
00:48:28 and  they just manhandle everybody like effort effortlessly they look like they just kind of woke up
00:48:34 rolled out of bed go fighting for like the the gold medal at the olympics and just effortlessly throw
00:48:41  like there's a match against you i guess yo romero yeah so like you you know if you look at
00:48:47 like who is the guy who's like intimidating in this case  and the terrifying looking
00:48:54 it's  it's joe romero just like a physical specimen and obviously like a super accomplished wrestler
00:49:00 i think this is for the gold medal yeah in 2008 2000 yeah sydney and then there this is
00:49:11 and what you like just to just show you like there's a inside trip effortless gucci and
00:49:21 you know it's a really creative kind of wrestling where it's organic yeah you're throwing all
00:49:27 these kinds of things this is a mix of judo a mix of like weird kind of moves it's not like
00:49:35 as funky as  ben askren it's it's just like legitimate basic well it's not funky for funky's sake and
00:49:42 i'm not poking right then asking to imply that that's what he's doing but it's like it's it's funny it's like a
00:49:47 lot of times it's almost like a musashi talked a lot about that you know that the only goal of combat is
00:49:52 to win is the the outcome is it's outcome driven versus like flourishing you know cool looking movements it's
00:49:58 like unless that had a utilitarian purpose like what are you wasting your time with that
00:50:02 both in the fight and also you know in practice but but as you mentioned it's almost like it looks like judo it looks like
00:50:07 wrestling it looks like jiu jitsu it's almost like i guess reminds me all of the martial arts is
00:50:12 again deeply tribal as well i i want to learn lex friedman martial arts and then i want to learn
00:50:17 another you know i guess transcendent person's martial arts and it just happened to be the set of movements that
00:50:22 you tended to do most of the time thanks to your body type and your opposition and whatnot but then i try to codify
00:50:27 that and force those to work as opposed to going i want to understand how the body works in concert and in in
00:50:33 congress with something else and other forces and move appropriately and that's why it's like it always struck me that the
00:50:39 psyche brothers are great examples of just moving like water but they to use bruce lee which is a little trite but
00:50:45 again it's brilliant it's like water can flow or what it can crash and they would crash when they needed to
00:50:49 crash and they would flow when they needed to flow but they would flow for the purpose of dissipating and then
00:50:53 crash when they would win and at the right moment then go back to flowing the second that the other person
00:50:57 found them and it's just it's beautiful to watch it's artistic and i think that great expression of anything
00:51:03 physical is ultimately studied as a science but expressed as an art and i think that that's something that gets
00:51:07 lost in jiu jitsu a lot of times when it gets a little bit a little nerdy like do this hand to your hand here like it's like
00:51:13 the more details i have the better when in reality that's just not not in my experience how it's done
00:51:21 might be a fun exercise of saying like what are the main positions and submissions in the art of jiu jitsu
00:51:29 you don't have to be complete that's a ridiculously i apologize for putting you on the spot like this but
00:51:34 it might be a nice exercise to think through it sure i mean i would just say that they're
00:51:38 they're you have your arms bend in various ways you have key lock americana straight arm locks
00:51:43 kimura omoplata omoplata is a chemorecognizable plot that's just executed emissions
00:51:48 like submissions breaking off your arm in all kinds of ways but ultimately the question is let's say you were a
00:51:53 terminator like a robot that i which of course you are going on it's like all right so we're
00:51:58 being completely literal but  and i and i couldn't harm you with any of these things would i still
00:52:04 use these positions the answer is yes they they create leverage they create control they create
00:52:08 shapes that i can affect and that can affect me and they can be affected through other forces
00:52:13 and other objects or structures like the ground or the wall i really enjoy mixed martial arts because
00:52:17 there's another component rather than just me and you and the floor there's me you the floor and the wall and it's
00:52:22 another player in the game that doesn't exist  in a grappling context with an  in a non-enclosed
00:52:29 you know i guess area of combat but you can strangle me or choke me what do you call it
00:52:36  without my arms being involved or you can use one of my shoulders to pin one side of my one carotid artery
00:52:41 off and you can enclose the other you can turn my knee in the exact same ways that you can turn my arm
00:52:47 straight this way and that way you can add a rotation to that or it can be directly linear against the joint
00:52:52 so i guess what i would say is the more that i've been able to understand jiu jitsu the more that i've been it's
00:52:59 given me a look into how we learn language where rather than learning five bazillion adjectives i go
00:53:05 i understand what an adjective is and of course we are all read into some degree of vocabulary i understand
00:53:11 what an adverb does and i understand what an adverb is i know what a noun is i know what the
00:53:15 component parts of a sentence are i know what you know i guess a clause a contraction any of these things
00:53:22 and it allows you to be interesting and artistic with your language to the extent that
00:53:26 you can but i can't like i can speak a degree of spanish but i'm not even slightly artistic in spanish i would be
00:53:32 something i speak like like a child with a head injury and anyway your basic understanding of
00:53:38 the english language allows you to then be a student of spanish 100 but i'm limited by my experience i'm
00:53:44 limited by my understanding of techniques and i'm limited unders by my understanding
00:53:48 almost like let's say techniques are like these are like vocabulary so even if i kind of sort of grasp
00:53:54 the sentence structure and the thought process and the thought patterns of of spanish which it's
00:53:59 interesting because just even though the orientation and the organization of a language and i've thought about this a
00:54:03 great deal you know the way that i perceive the world is affected deeply by the language
00:54:07 that i learned you know the again if i learned i have no idea the chinese language structures
00:54:13 but i can only imagine that it would be that it would affect it's like a different lens we're looking at the same
00:54:17 thing but i have i have a different set of sunglasses on than you do and  that's that's very very
00:54:22 interesting i'll use the quran as an example you know apparently it's unbelievably poetic in in arabic
00:54:28 still neat and was interesting reading in english but i'm told by people that i trust that it
00:54:33 just one doesn't bear resemblance to the other and i think that's a very interesting thing that you may be able
00:54:39 to say the same thing but in in a more in i guess in a different way in a more artistic way that that
00:54:44 may not translate on a one-for-one kind of fidelity but the more that we're able to understand
00:54:50 about how the body works the more examples of the body working this way the body working that way the body
00:54:54 working that way the more that i'm able to eventually become an artist but it has to be
00:54:58 studied as a science first and it does start with technique collection vocabulary collection the same way we learn
00:55:04 in school you remember how to say quickly 17 different ways and let's say i speak spanish i'm only i only know three so you might use
00:55:13 quickly you might use an adjective like quickly in spanish but use one of the many many options to describe that that
00:55:18 i don't understand now i sit there and go like wait what i can't be artistic i can't be
00:55:23 as organic with the language as i'd like so i believe that jiu jitsu a lot of times starts with
00:55:28 the acquisition of a lot of hey do this this this drill this technique here's an american americana to an arm lock arm
00:55:32 locked to a triangle but the problem with that is oftentimes we get stuck in that phase
00:55:40 and i people eventually become move collectors or sequence collectors and i notice this when i'm trying to do
00:55:44 dvds or i guess like an instructional series now or even teaching in class i don't believe in that form of learning
00:55:50 anymore not that it's not valuable but i don't believe i don't understand jujitsu on that level
00:55:55 anymore so what i'm trying to do is get across the basic ideas to people and say hey you need to fill in the gaps with going
00:56:01 to class all the time you need to go hey learn this move learn that technique learn that technique because otherwise
00:56:05 i'm basically just throwing at you like 75 different words that you could use but that hasn't really taught you
00:56:10 how to how to speak a language whereas if you give me the language structure
00:56:15 you can fill in these pieces on your own and then eventually speak organically in lex form which will be ultimately
00:56:22 unique to you because otherwise you just end up being a weird facsimile of whatever it is that
00:56:25 i'm doing for mostly the worst i'd say but  yeah that's what people i mean people comment
00:56:32 like is this especially people haven't listened to me before  is this guy drunk or high does he
00:56:42 does mit really allow slow people to  to be like like what's what's wrong with him is he
00:56:48 getting sleep are you okay and does he need help so that that's similar with my jiu jitsu it's like this
00:56:54 is this guy is this guy really whatever rank i was throughout i remember just like is this guy really
00:57:00 this rank i just have a very kind of certain way of sitting and being slow and
00:57:07 lazy looking that that was ultimately the language that i had to discover and it was  it was yeah it was a very liberating
00:57:16 moment i think of probably a few years of getting my ass kicked especially with open guard and butterfly
00:57:23 to where you really allow yourself to take in the entirety of the language and realize that um
00:57:30 that i'm not i'm different i'm a unique i'm i'm unique and like i have a very  i have a language i have a set of
00:57:37 techniques a way i move my body that needs that i'm the one to discover
00:57:43 like it's you can only you can learn specific techniques and so on but you really have to
00:57:47 understand your own body that's the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu like you said is like the the connection about your
00:57:55 philosophy your view of the world with the physical and like connecting those two things
00:58:01 how you perceive the world how you interpret ideas of the world about exhaustion about force
00:58:08 about effortlessness like what it really means to relax all these kinds of loose concepts and
00:58:12 then actually teach your body to like do those things and like you know and be able to apply
00:58:20 force and spurts to be able to relax in sports and like figure all that stuff out for my for your my individual body but it's
00:58:27 as you mentioned that's i couldn't agree with you more it's a discovery process and no one can cheat that process
00:58:32 which is at the same time it's almost like imagine i want to start writing books in second grade unless
00:58:37 maybe i'm like staggeringly brilliant i wish i could only conceptualize someone being able to do that but
00:58:42 maybe a mozart of the english language where you're out there doing it but for most of us we don't have enough
00:58:47 knowledge enough information enough experience to be able to be to express ourselves so we have to basically
00:58:56 input repeat which is important but it's the process as you say of going through that of getting your ass kicked
00:59:00 just like well that didn't work well that didn't work that felt right but i don't know nobody else does that i guess
00:59:04 i don't believe in that versus eventually going i don't know i'll just try going my own way and see
00:59:09 what happens and now i'll get yelled at and people won't like me and if it works they'll say i got lucky and if it
00:59:13 doesn't work they'll say i was dumb but  which maybe all is right but basically 
00:59:18 you know going through that iterative process that allows you to eventually find your self-expression and find your
00:59:23 voice so that you you fight the same way that you speak the same way that you write the same way
00:59:27 that you think in a way that that is uniquely you that will also ultimately allow you
00:59:33 to understand other people being uniquely them because even if you can only conceptualize and i think about
00:59:36 this a lot for society stuff where i go well this is how i feel about this but
00:59:41 am i objectively right maybe about a couple things but that's a small box that i have to be very very careful
00:59:46 about what i think is objective and versus what's not and i have to be open to the possibility that all the
00:59:49 things that i think are objectively correct may or may not be and that should allow me to have some
00:59:56 degree of compassion or consideration for other people both in their martial arts journey and in their
01:00:00 in their journey you know as people as human beings because i understand that they're on a it's a we're all on a
01:00:07 path right it's all a again an iterative process of eventual self-expression but i think that's one
01:00:12 of the things that we see having trouble when we see tribalism which i mean
01:00:17 raises an expression of that political affiliation expression of that all of these things that can go in
01:00:22 really uncomfortable directions people are looking for hey where do i plant my feet over here
01:00:26 where's where's the thing that i know is right and that we can all agree on the following and i think that we see that in martial
01:00:32 arts we're like oh i do this style why do that style i do that stuff which is like hey man we're all
01:00:36 just pushing forward in a certain direction you're trying to do our best and i understand why you feel the way
01:00:39 you do i may have felt like that at one point too but  you know what i'm just trying to
01:00:44 learn and understand versus i've already acquired enough knowledge let me cross my arms and start
01:00:50 to to look who's up around here yeah and and i think that  that that's an it's an interesting trap
01:00:56 that i think is very human trapped to fall into but it definitely happens early on it's something it's a joke in
01:01:00 the jiu jitsu world right like how the blue belt that knows everything well initially it's like what i know nothing
01:01:03 and i at least think i know nothing then i'd learn a little bit and i think it's a
01:01:07 lot bit and then you know the more you learn the more you go like i don't even know what
01:01:11 i'm doing yeah that's exactly right we kind of talked about it a little bit
01:01:17 but  once again a lot of people that listen to this have never been on the mat have never
01:01:21 tried jiu jitsu but are really curious about it everybody at all positions like i think
01:01:27 elon musk's kids are not doing jiu jitsu andrew yang is like they're all you know the world is curious
01:01:34 it's a it's a nice it seems to be a nice methodology by which to humble your ego which to grow intellectually
01:01:40 and physically so people are curious about it so the natural question is if they're curious
01:01:44 about it how would you recommend they get started maybe like
01:01:51 what do you recommend the first day week month year first couple years look like like how do you ease into it
01:01:58 and make sure that it's a positive experience and you progress in the most optimal and
01:02:03 positive way the first thing you can do is simply ask yourself why
01:02:08 why you want to be involved you know i remember the first day that i walked into ronan athletics in
01:02:13 new york city to train under godfather my son now christian montes and i didn't know what i was getting
01:02:19 myself into i played baseball through high school and i wanted i was at manhattan college
01:02:26 in the bronx and i wanted to go and learn martial arts because it was always something that was
01:02:30 interesting to me but it was never something that that was i that i knew was accessible and it
01:02:35 definitely wasn't really around in northern virginia where i grew up whereas then you stick yourself in in
01:02:40 manhattan and there's stuff everywhere so anyway i guess i didn't know what to expect i didn't know
01:02:45 if i was going to get beat up if people were going to be nice if people were not going to be nice um
01:02:51 but what i began with was i think expectation management and i think that that's something that
01:02:56  i would that'll be the first thing that i would start is almost imagining what is it
01:03:01 that i'm getting myself into because i love the martial arts with with the martial arts has given me
01:03:05 everything in life and i'm so thankful i wouldn't be sitting here without without that that experience that
01:03:12 journey of the people that i've met the place that i got i could never ever have ever imagined um
01:03:18 and i'm just unbelievably thankful for that but i think that the thing that that helped me
01:03:26 most of all was starting with you know my mom said something to me one time and she said you know there's
01:03:31 two types of people in various situations there's why and there's why not and you know it's understandable to have
01:03:37 questions concerns things like that but maybe sometimes a little bit easier when you're when you're younger
01:03:42 to just trust people or just say oh well you know but  we go hey you want to climb that
01:03:47 rock i'm like yeah why not let's go hey you want to jump in that river yeah why not sure versus if i have to
01:03:53 reason my way into everything i have to be talked into everything a lot of times i'll talk myself out of
01:03:57 it and i think that a lot of times this is the thinker's disease you want to figure out what's going to
01:04:02 happen and what you should expect to have happen before you get involved versus going
01:04:07 using the old bruce lee saying again it's like no amount of thinking or training on the on the side of the river
01:04:12 will teach you how to swim you have to jump in and there are risks associated with that
01:04:18 and so  i guess  psychological are usually the biggest ones that's the biggest hurdle and physical
01:04:24 but the biggest thing that i guess i would suggest to anyone to say why do you want to do this you're like well i
01:04:29 want to challenge myself i want to learn i would like to learn to fight i wanted to learn to fight so that i could
01:04:33 protect myself and if and if anything else other people if only within arms reach i perceived that if i had some small
01:04:39 degree of power i generally wouldn't use it which is why i was like i'll give it a try i'll
01:04:44 try to be reasonable and hopefully if i make a mistake i'll apologize to people but basically 
01:04:50 i said yeah i'd like to have that and i wanna i know this is gonna be challenging and we'll see what happens
01:04:55 and that means that getting beat up and i didn't get like hurt but getting roughed up and getting my arm
01:05:00 bent this way or that way getting choked i was like well this is all supposed to happen that's no big deal
01:05:04 it would be like going and joining the army during peace time and then going oh i'm just doing this
01:05:08 for a college education you're like okay that's cool man and then all of a sudden war breaks out
01:05:12 and they want to send me somewhere and i'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa i didn't sign up for that gig
01:05:16 actu actually you did whether you realized it or not you may not have thought that you did
01:05:21 but you did so getting your mind right and and just going what are my expectations this activity what is it that i'm
01:05:26 looking to do and of course you know you're you're going into a gym you're going into a place that you don't
01:05:31 know people you probably don't know people and you don't know the coach and even if you do want to hey how you doing
01:05:35 shake your hand type of level you know 95 percent of my students don't know me not really you know i'll try to
01:05:40 be polite and not annoy them too much but they don't know me and i don't know them i understand if they don't trust me i wouldn't
01:05:48 trust trust me either if i were them but at the same time someone has to take that leap and one of
01:05:52 the things that i've noticed as a martial arts instructor that's the biggest struggle
01:05:57  with dealing with adults which is why a lot of people like to teach kids is because kids don't ask
01:06:02 don't argue now that also means there's there's all sorts of pitfalls with that sort of thing and that can be an issue
01:06:07 but you know i guess a lot of times people get to a point in their life you know in their
01:06:11 20s early 30s where now i'm i'm a manager now i know what i'm doing no one talks to me like that yeah versus
01:06:16 like hey man you go join boot camp i don't care if you are elon musk they're gonna tell you to shut up and do
01:06:19 push-ups yeah and that's what's great about it yeah so you are taking a leap of faith
01:06:26 into a world that you're gonna be a tiny fish and you gotta hope that the people who are who are guiding you in that
01:06:32 in that journey are gonna have i can't say even say your best interests at heart because they don't even know
01:06:36 you but they'll they'll try to do no harm and they'll try to help you in the way that they would understand
01:06:40 and i guess that's for instance that's what i would try to do with anyone that that comes into my gym i would try
01:06:45 to help them in the way that i understand they need as best i can in as safe and reasonable a way as possible
01:06:52 but sometimes in a way that's going to make them uncomfortable particularly if physical combat
01:06:56 and and it's not something they've done before if a lot of people go in without even
01:07:02 having played you know contact sports and so that can be a big jump and you have to understand if if that's
01:07:07 where you're starting from no worries but you're going to have to kind of work your way to it and it's going to be
01:07:11 uncomfortable and and that's okay it's part of the process and you're gonna have some bumps and bruises
01:07:15 and you're not gonna want to roll with that guy in the corner because that that person's rough and they beat you up and
01:07:19 they're like okay but is this a big hurt or is it a little hurt if it's a big hurt
01:07:25 okay if it's a little hurt you need to use you just drop a little bit yeah it's such an
01:07:29 interesting balance because to find i think one of the most important things
01:07:35 as in anything i think in life is the selection of the people or that you put around you
01:07:41 i mean that's true with the like getting married that's true with  like if you go to if people ask me
01:07:46 like graduate students like your phd advisor can can be the difference it's everything
01:07:54 it's like you spend five years with somebody they're going to basically define the more impact on you than anybody you
01:08:01 marry anybody you hang out with it's a huge impact and the same with the the coach selection which is
01:08:09 like the school selection is it's going to be really important about in terms of like who you select will 
01:08:18 define how happy like the trajectory of your growth and how happy you are with the entirety of the experience and yet
01:08:26 like the the flip side of that is especially if you have an ego especially if you are the manager then you need to
01:08:31 let go of some stuff you're gonna feel like with the good with the best kind of coach
01:08:37 that's that's what you need right but there's a nice there's a weird balance there to find
01:08:42 like i i mean like and everybody needs a different thing like i'm much more  i enjoy being sort of like
01:08:51 it sounds weird but like i am you know from the wrestling background i enjoy feeling like crap in the sense
01:08:57 like the coach like getting beat up i don't actually enjoy it
01:09:02 it's not like some masochistic thing or whatever it's the growth like i like the anxiety i like 
01:09:12 feeling  like like when i go home like emotionally physically it's like it's growth it's a sign of growth
01:09:19 right like if you're not having to feel those things you're probably in your comfort zone
01:09:23 which is fine but that's not your growth zone right and everybody has a different threshold for that and you i mean the the
01:09:31 beautiful thing about jiu jitsu is like it's also has like a yoga feel to it like you're learning about your body
01:09:38 so depending on the gym and depending on in fact the coaches the people around you within
01:09:43 the gym you can select little groups too kind of like the people with who you roll like if you're a smaller person
01:09:49 it doesn't mean you have to go against big people you can go against the people who like
01:09:54 smoke a lot of weed and they're chill or you can go against like that crazy ripped blue belt competitor who's like
01:09:59 out to destroy everybody and depending on like what your mindset is you can kind of select that
01:10:07 it's just such a fascinating journey  of like basically self-discovery i couldn't agree with you more it's i mean
01:10:11 what you need may change over time right maybe what you needed what you need today could
01:10:16 change six months from now or a year from now and that's something that i experience i'll use my  first coach
01:10:21 christian again as a great example of someone who i really look up to and respect and someone who
01:10:26 helped me a lot like at a time when i really needed some guidance and i needed to learn
01:10:30 martial arts but get into i the hens of gracie's gym was right down the street from where christian was teaching
01:10:34 and christian was a blue belt at the time it was  he was teaching at a place called fight house which was this awesome
01:10:41 like you know like 90s early 2000s you know warehouse area  down on fashion avenue in 
01:10:47 in manhattan off of like between seventh and eighth and  it was like like two basketball courts wide but like
01:10:52 there was the guys over here there was the kali guys over there there was a wing chun over there with jits in the corner
01:10:57 and hens was one of the most famous academies in the world at that time still is
01:11:01 and i just didn't know what enzo gracie was and i mean it's a great gym and it's a fantastic
01:11:06 place for people to train but i think what was right for me at the time was to i stumbled into a you know like a
01:11:12 two-person elevator up and found a place where six people trained at that time
01:11:17 and i had someone that that i could that could give me some like in addition to martial arts advice
01:11:21 like personal guidance and that made it that made a big difference and then one initially we
01:11:26 would have like competitions or like intra intra you know gym competitions with the guys we would comp
01:11:32 we would roll with them and like again it was great because they were just a bunch of like like russian dudes from
01:11:36 like brighton beach and they would come down and then we would all fight and then everyone would train and we'd all drink
01:11:41 tea and then go home and  anyway  what was  it was super super tough and they were
01:11:47 like again just a tough group of people it was great and then i remember when i decided after
01:11:52 like four or five months i'm like man i really want to try to take this seriously and i told christian about
01:11:55 that and he's like well hey i think you need to do the following and it was you know like hey here's there was a guy
01:12:00 named jeff ruth who was  about at the time which was a much bigger deal than it is now but it was
01:12:05 10-0 as an mma fighter a lot of amateur body spirits super tough dude and jeff was was the best person at that
01:12:10 time that i'd ever trained with and i just got squashed christians beat me up too but like
01:12:14 jeff would just absolutely kick the crap out of me and i was like this is awesome and this was back when i was at
01:12:19 home i went home for the summer for that and chris is like hey i think you should stay because i told him that's what i was
01:12:24 thinking and this was a coach that you know when it's like when initially was exactly what i needed and then he's
01:12:29 like well hey that's not what i'm doing here maybe they're going to be able to help you on
01:12:32 to a path that's that's kind of commensurate with what your goals are at the moment
01:12:36 and then you know that was a niche that was an interesting thing and i really got i feel that i was fortunate to start
01:12:42 at a place where my coach was able to transition roles and and and do so comfortably and i
01:12:47 think that that also was probably a factor of the fact that you know where he'd done some of his
01:12:52 training prior like there have been issues with with the coach there we're like not supporting not having the support
01:12:57 you know feeling like hey like i'm gonna hold on to my students i'm gonna hold on to my best guy or my best girl even if i can't
01:13:03 take them where they need to go so that was an interesting thing and just recognizing also though that
01:13:09 the people like the same way you're an individual going into a gym and you don't know what you're getting into
01:13:14 your coach is a person too and he or she you know they may have been doing this activity longer than you but they're not
01:13:19 they're not some weird little you know all-knowing god they don't know anything but they're gonna
01:13:23 they may say something that pisses you off they may they may yell at you they may help you they may
01:13:29 inadvertently cause you some sort of you know some sort of issue and just being able to recognize that
01:13:34 even though i say this to people and i've said this to people in my gym i'm like you know we're in the service industry
01:13:39 man but i'm not at your service like don't get it twisted like i will absolutely do my best to help people
01:13:45 i'm there to do my best as a martial arts coach but i'm here to do my best as a martial arts coach and i'll do my best and
01:13:50 periodically i make mistakes and i own an apology or two and i'll try to give them out when i can
01:13:54 but  we're not mcdonald's it's not oh you gave me 100 bucks so you do whatever you want in here this is my house this
01:13:59 is my gym this is my dojo this is this is the martial arts this is not a basketball team yeah there's something
01:14:02 beautiful about martial arts like exactly as you said as the coach
01:14:08 like in wrestling and at least collegiate like high level wrestling it's like there's a dictatorship aspect
01:14:16 to a coach that is very important to have like this this ridiculous sometimes nature of like master and so on
01:14:23 and bowing all these traditions there's something it seems ridiculous from the outside perhaps but there's something
01:14:28 really powerful to that because that process of you said why not of letting go of the leap of faith
01:14:35 requires you to believe that the coach has your best interest in mind and just give yourself
01:14:40 over to their ideas of how how you should grow and that's an
01:14:47 interesting thing i mean i've never been able to really see coaches i've had as
01:14:54 human they're always you always it's like a father figure or like this you always put them in this
01:15:01 position of power and i think that's i think at least for me it's been a very it's been a very useful way to see the
01:15:08 coach because it allows you to not think and let go and really allow yourself to grow
01:15:13 and emotionally deal with all the beatings they'll push you where past oftentimes where you would have
01:15:18 stopped yourself right which is great and hopefully they know they if they're paying attention and
01:15:23 they're they're still a person they can make mistakes but they'll push you further than you would have gone
01:15:27 but not so far that it's not facilitative right right that's something that i can
01:15:31 say like ferraza hobby the head coach at tristar my head coach for mma kenny florian one of the head coaches for mma
01:15:37 have both been phenomenal influences paul schreiner who's the  one of the assistants at marcelo
01:15:41 garcia's academy coached me in jiu jitsu for a long time brilliant instructor they've all been able to do that and i
01:15:47 think what's interesting about all of those guys they're very sharp but they they're very intuitive as well and i
01:15:51 think that for us actually  you know told me about something that john wooden said john wooden the
01:15:57 legendary ucla basketball coach just a simple philosophical idea just he said some people's life is a
01:16:03 bowl of it needs some whipped cream in it some people's life is a bowl of whipped cream
01:16:08 needs a little bit of in it just to balance it out and it's an interesting thing coaching everyone the same way
01:16:13 doesn't work you know that's i think the difference between a coach and an instructor and a lot of times people
01:16:17 think they want to coach but they really want an instructor i'm like hey lex tell me what to do not how to do
01:16:21 it and then other times people think they want you know an instructor and they really want to coach
01:16:26 i'm like man this guy's just giving me information a coach is so much more than an instructor and that's a huge leap
01:16:31 and that's something that i think that people need to understand when they're going into martial arts and i understand
01:16:35 i can totally grasp why they don't because how how would they know but  i think about this a lot like me giving
01:16:41 you 150 dollars for a month which is not nothing that's for sure that does not that pays for instructor
01:16:46 really coach is a relationship that gets developed because can you imagine like just the amount of
01:16:51 emotional investment and and time thinking away from from like oh alex isn't here anymore what can i do to help
01:16:55 him what does he need like that's that's serious and that's the difference between that's
01:17:01 that's oftentimes the difference that at getting getting over the hump in various situations so it's a it's an interesting you know
01:17:07 bargain that's being made like commitment by the by the instructor who becomes a coach
01:17:11 commitment by the student you know like there's a financial transaction there's a lot of things
01:17:15 going on there but i feel very fortunate to have had not just instructors in my time but
01:17:19 coaches and that means sometimes we butted heads and sometimes i look back and i think i
01:17:23 was right and other times looked back on my own no they were definitely right but there was always the trust with
01:17:28 the exception of one time that i feel that trust was greatly betrayed that
01:17:33 rightly or wrongly whether mistakes mistakes will be made but everyone is attempting to do do the
01:17:39 right thing under no circumstances would i intentionally do anything malicious you know versus
01:17:43 hey i might have done i'm going to burn your house down but you can be darn sure it wasn't on purpose
01:17:47 and i think that as long as there's that mutual understanding and mutual belief of goodwill
01:17:52 which again doesn't just magic up out of nowhere i understand i think that that's when then great
01:17:57 things can happen and i look at all the athletes that i know you know the guys and girls that i've
01:18:01 watched become fantastic in various places almost invariably it never happened alone yeah yeah
01:18:08 i'm really torn about that like maybe you can help have you seen the movie whiplash so it's 
01:18:15 i would say from an outsider's perspective people should watch it's a i guess jazz band it's a movie about a
01:18:22 drummer and the instructor and he it's a basically i would say from the outsider's
01:18:30 perspective it's a toxic relationship but he's really the coach whatever we call him
01:18:36 pushes the the musician the drama to his limits like to where he just feels like emotionally
01:18:45 it's a it looks like a toxic relationship but it's one that ultimately is very
01:18:51 productive for the improvement of the musician i have the same like in my own experience i had um
01:18:59 i got a chance to train a couple places regularly and so one of my coaches  who is a great human being a lot of
01:19:06 people love him but when i was a blue belt he was pushing me a lot for competition
01:19:13 and every time i stepped on the mat i anxious and almost afraid of training because of like the places i'm gonna
01:19:23 have to go and then the i can't i don't know what's good or bad because
01:19:30 i think i've become a better person because of that experience like i needed that
01:19:37 and on the flip side like the place i got my black belt from balance studios is i
01:19:42 remember also blue belt  the coach sitting down and i was going to competition and he
01:19:48 saw something in me where he said you know like good luck but win or lose
01:20:00 we always love you like i i re i remember that because i really needed that at that time like i was
01:20:06 putting so much pressure on myself like i'm not an actual professional competitor you know i just competed like i'm a pg
01:20:12 student like but like it was clearly having a psychological effect on me
01:20:19 and that's what a great coach does it's like you know it's like life is more important than jiu-jitsu
01:20:24 sense that's right it's bigger so they find you use jiu-jitsu when you need it to grow as a person
01:20:33 and when it overwhelms you you you have to pull that person out like look at the bigger picture always look
01:20:37 at the bigger picture it's fascinating and i don't know what to make of it i don't think i would have
01:20:42 it any other way is both the anxiety and the and the love yeah i think that i couldn't that's a
01:20:48 really interesting thing that you're describing that i i guess it kind of brings me back to a
01:20:53 lot of the other things we've been discussing is just almost like the the reciprocal
01:20:57 nature of everything where no pressure that's great everyone's happy all the time it's either i mean
01:21:04 let's  use an example of sci-fi movies let's say the matrix which of course the first one was amazing and then each
01:21:09 subsequent movie made the series worse but but basically i'm working on a new one by the way yeah i've heard
01:21:14 we'll see i was hoping for the best but but basically  you know it's like hey we started
01:21:19 our first initial world agent smith says to neo he's like our first world was a utopia where everyone was happy
01:21:24 and nothing ever went wrong it's like your primitive cerebrum rejected it and i think that there's
01:21:30 obviously i mean what do i think but i guess well i'm here so i might as well say what i think
01:21:36 i guess  you know great things are fantastic a kind gentle place is fantastic and this is
01:21:44 again why i love dune because i think doon does such a great job of expressing frank herbert does such a great job of
01:21:49 expressing again the reciprocal nature of these ideas you know look at  look at sparta for
01:21:53 instance or at least what i understand sparta from the reading and also watching 300. um
01:21:59 you know and reading wikipedia and reading the wikipedia article about the movie not the place but  it's um
01:22:09 that's a hard brutal place and that was their benefit to that like absolutely was there drawback to that
01:22:15 absolutely is it sustainable i should i would think probably not i mean granted it hasn't sustained
01:22:20 but i mean that type of a of a thing it burns too hot almost and it 
01:22:26 it destroys the host at a certain point and you know i guess that that type of unforgiving nature
01:22:33 but entirely entirely permissive has its own issues and i guess coming back to your what your description of like describing
01:22:39 a toxic relationship is a very dangerous and tricky thing because it's almost like  it's like bird's-eye view me
01:22:44 it's what you know you see let's say a husband and a wife arguing and you're like all right well
01:22:49 sort of somebody hitting somebody i need to keep myself out of this because i have no idea
01:22:54 what i'm seeing something but i don't know what's going on or why specifically and again short of it going to a place
01:23:02 that's that just out out of bounds i don't know who's right here i don't know who's wrong and i don't know what
01:23:08 phase of this things they're in so i guess long term what's good for yeah both people right it's dangerous for so if i want to
01:23:15 put my finger on the scale i can understand the desire to do i'm like hey guys let's break it up
01:23:19 yeah but and that may be the right thing at the time but at the same time i'm not sure so i think back to all of the times that
01:23:26 you know that like you mentioned your coach pushing you when very very hard and then other times
01:23:30 going like hey let's put in perspective here i think that's an interesting thing for high performance and i think that we're
01:23:34 seeing that again societally you know now or at least maybe that's it just pops up on my
01:23:39 internet feed periodically but coaches shouldn't be allowed to do this or yell at this person to yell
01:23:44 at that person like well have you ever been go to a boxing gym it's not a commercial entity not really
01:23:51 a real boxing not la boxing not a ufc gym like a real place you're going to see what things are like when it's entirely
01:23:58 performance-based go to wrestling room at a high level you know again there's there's left and
01:24:02 right limits and there are such things obviously as abuse of course but and that should never be tolerated
01:24:10 but it's not a commercial entity i don't need to be sweet to you if you're if you're screwing up if you're
01:24:14 dropping the ball and in fact recognizing that i'm not doing you a favor or the team a favor by by
01:24:20 being permissive of that type of behavior i think is important everything in its context and at its time
01:24:25 is important and i guess i can think again at the times that i've been put put or had put on me like a great deal
01:24:31 of pressure to do x y as a year to succeed or to push for success and
01:24:38 i can't look back fondly enough on those times they were tough at the time but without that i'm not sitting here without that
01:24:45 i don't go from growing up in a very nice family in the suburbs to fighting at the highest level in jiu jitsu
01:24:52 nogi and now in mixed martial arts starting a career at age 27. you know i don't it just doesn't happen
01:24:58 because people generally speaking from that background don't get pushed hard enough physically to be able to make that transition
01:25:06 and that has benefits and it has drawbacks you know when you stare into the abyss it stares back and i think
01:25:11 that that's an important thing to understand you know you stare long enough you you can become something that you don't
01:25:17 that you would be sorry that you did you don't look enough and you don't have perspective either
01:25:22 you know and i i think that that's an interesting thing i can speak to someone who's relative to being someone who's
01:25:27 relatively articulate and reasonably i try to be reasonable but you know i'll say inspiring if
01:25:31 people get crazy with me they get a warning and then i'm gonna crack them and what did they expect oh they hear
01:25:39 the guy on an interview but who did they think they were meeting because there's also the guy in the ring
01:25:44 and there's layers there too i remember training with you it's kind of funny there's like there's
01:25:52 well you didn't know who i was i mean you still like i have a really good strength a lot by
01:25:57 the way that so i don't remember what rank i was but it might have been purple or something
01:26:03 like that and i did some like i you had this look on your face which i've often seen
01:26:10 in black belts it's like here he goes again like here here's him trying this thing and then when i kind of annoyed you a
01:26:20 little bit with it now i get that it was a good like i you know i did something somewhat effective
01:26:24 like some like maybe a little bit off balance yeah there's i just peeled off a little layer of ryan
01:26:32 hall to where i was like okay let me let me like there there's like layers underneath the
01:26:38 covers are like somewhere in there like so it was like okay this like new guy rolls in here he
01:26:43 thinks he can do this stupid thing and then and then you start to beat the hell out of me
01:26:49 but the the point is there's layers here from the guy who was being interviewed now to like
01:26:53 genghis khan but it's but it's all in the same body right but it's like all of us are like
01:26:58 that right in various different directions and recognizing that's okay it's just there are consequences to all
01:27:03 every choice that we make as a consequence sometimes there's like objectively wrong or
01:27:06 objectively right but at least in my mind that's a pretty small box everything else is just there's a
01:27:11 consequence of that do you like that consequence do you not and who do i want to become what do i
01:27:16 want to try to hone myself or anyone else into and also like but this is something i've screwed up as
01:27:22 a coach plenty of times you know like if someone says if you're if like i come to like lex i
01:27:27 really really want to take you know research very seriously like okay i believe you now
01:27:32 i haven't shown you that but i believe you're like okay and now me not showing up to research or to
01:27:37 study or not being up until three in the morning thinking about this is no longer acceptable there was a time like five seconds
01:27:43 before me making that statement that if i went to bed without reading the book that i needed to read
01:27:48 no worries but the second that i made that statement your your expectations for me change and
01:27:52 maybe it's something that's something that i've screwed up a whole bunch of times in my
01:27:55 as a teacher because it's an interesting thing obviously you know being a like running a martial arts school
01:28:01 as you're principally an athlete is sometimes i don't pay enough attention to what people are doing i just go oh
01:28:07 okay you say xyz i'm like roger that i believe you're cool i will now put you in category x and
01:28:13 whether rightly or wrongly like maybe this person didn't understand what they were asking for or i didn't express this
01:28:17 or the other and it just it caused cross wires and then most times you hash it out you have a
01:28:21 discussion you figure out get to the bottom of what people are trying to do or what they want
01:28:25 but  if i was paying more attention i think i could have been a lot more effective or if i had more experience
01:28:29 and sometimes maybe i'm not sharp enough or i don't person i'm not perceptive enough to be able to
01:28:32 to see what's going on and maybe with years more down the line i'll be able to have a sharper perception but  i think
01:28:38 that's another one of those interesting things that some that sometimes i would caution or
01:28:42 not caution but just to inform a prospective martial arts student depending upon where you're going you
01:28:47 know this you both you and also your coach or other people in the room they wear many hats
01:28:51 and sometimes there's a i had the wrong hat on you were talking to me as lex the guy i didn't realize you were
01:28:56 talking to me i thought she would tell me his elects the guy i didn't realize she talked me as lex the martial artist
01:28:59 i'm like oh crap i was talking to the wrong person so it's almost like if you had a like i run
01:29:04 my gym with my wife she's a black belt so she's my wife she's my peers as a martial artist 
01:29:12 on in jiu jitsu he's here by the way in judging so exactly all right well all right so but a fellow
01:29:17 black belt and i guess like another he doesn't have a microphone so you can't hear all the trash he's talking exactly
01:29:22 but it can be tough and that's something we've had to work through a lot and it's like looking back and it's like now
01:29:26 being where i'm at now and it's easy me to say that because she's in the room and i don't want to stab me just continue to
01:29:31 slowly poison me over time yeah which frankly i understand you know it's it's the sort of thing that
01:29:38 is now way more effective than anything else i could really reasonably expect to have but there
01:29:43 were times when when both of us you know were justifiably annoyed at the other because
01:29:48 of crossed wires and sometimes you know you just have to scream in anywhere mr standing anyway but
01:29:52 again like i've i coached some of my friends i've coached i've coached my friend who i've known since i was
01:29:57 four years old you know sometimes i don't go hey buddy how you doing someone's like
01:30:00 what the are you doing put your hand over there how many times we talked about this and then you walk away
01:30:05 and you can see him look at you crooked and you're like oh crap oh yeah he thought i was talking to his friend
01:30:09 yeah well all right we need to talk this one out hashing out and not he's wrong how could he possibly think
01:30:14 that way like oh no i totally understand that but if i was 22 like doesn't he know i'm a purple belt
01:30:19 some nonsense like that and it's and it doesn't come from a bad place but it's just i guess that comes
01:30:23 back to society to anything people only have the perspective that they have and the awareness that we have
01:30:28 and so again going back and going hey guys grace like i don't expect it's not fair for me to go i for
01:30:33 ufc why doesn't this guy who came in as an attorney understand how hardcore this needs to be and like how could he
01:30:40 yeah and at the same time though if if i'm using the language of someone that is interested in at least
01:30:45 performance from a martial arts perspective i understand how that could be off-putting let's say for instance
01:30:49 someone that's comple like all of that would be out of bounds in their normal workplace but if
01:30:54 they think of the gym as my office then whether they agree or disagree with what's going on they go okay i hear why
01:30:58 i see why that might have happened let's talk about this and we can again all push forward in a positive direction
01:31:04 that benefits i guess everyone's journey throughout the activity and now on top of all that there's moods okay
01:31:12 i mean especially lately  i think two days ago maybe yesterday no two days ago
01:31:19 i've never been that cranky in my life i think i i don't know what it was
01:31:26 but i wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me it was like i i was just very conscious
01:31:31 of this feeling of like why why is this happening right now so i consciously decided as i usually do
01:31:39 in those cases to not say anything to anybody how do you do that  well i you know it's  it's
01:31:49 yeah meditating because it's not i i tend to i tend to then visualize what's gonna
01:31:53 happen in the next like how is this gonna make my life better like if i say something
01:32:03 that mean to somebody else i have  just started a conflict that will just escalate will continue
01:32:13 will add more conflict to my life it will make things i just don't like the feeling you will create and so you
01:32:20 live a lot enough life to know that like  it's just like with like street fighting you know i i i would get into a lot of
01:32:28 fights when i was younger just on the street but then you realize like it's not
01:32:33 like a jiu jitsu match or something like that it's not it'll escalate it'll it'll might come back at you
01:32:41 it'll like that person might find you again but more importantly the anxiety of it of
01:32:49 having created little enemies in this world distorts the way you see the world so i've noticed that like
01:32:57 if i'm shitty to people on the internet which i haven't been i think in a long time is like it it somehow brings the
01:33:03 shittiness to you more and more it escalates like the more love you put out there the more like the people who put love out
01:33:12 like surround you well you mentioned forgiveness as well like you said like i guess back to the original you
01:33:17 know the holocaust survivor scenario we're like oh my god like you think of the ultimate
01:33:22 in in like i've never experienced one one billionth of that level of of pain and horror and it's like and i
01:33:28 can't let this little thing go you know i guess that's an interesting thing i think you're just making the
01:33:32 point in your personal life i guess the same way right yeah there yeah and
01:33:37 on the internet it's hard i've somehow gotten i mean you've you've had a level of celebrity for a while
01:33:45 i've recently gotten some level of like celebrity and like these people who are just shitty for no reason
01:33:53 come out from all from all places like calling me a fraud or anything else i'm using a jain silent
01:34:00 bob strike back they find out a movie's gonna be made about them and people are talking on the internet and they're
01:34:03 like what's the internet and then someone shows them and they're like what and they go to a message board
01:34:08 and they go to hollywood to try to stop it from being made and they eventually get money for their likeness and they
01:34:12 use the money to buy plane tickets and fly around and beat the out of all the people that talk bad about them
01:34:17 yeah it's tough i mean it's  i'm i'm having trouble with it because there's people like
01:34:22 yeah there's you know there's posts and forums and like heated discussions about is lex vaping a fraud i don't know what
01:34:29 has he really done and there's like and then there's people like well i think he's an alright guy but i'm not sure
01:34:35 like like there's like literal discussions and i'm like like nobody like if you increase the
01:34:41 level of celebrity there's going to be like one of the things that hurts my heart a little bit
01:34:46 is like some level of toxicity around joe rogan for example
01:34:52 there's like communities of people that now like talk about him selling out for example all that kind of stuff
01:35:00 and i don't you know and joe i've talked to him about it is amazing that he 
01:35:05 he says don't read the comments he legitimately doesn't read the comments his heart and his soul doesn't give a
01:35:12 damn about the comments all he gives a damn about is his friends like one of the things that's really
01:35:19 inspiring to me and that's i've had a conversation with them offline about spotify and  the removed episodes people are curious
01:35:30 it's  it's a thing on the internet where  i think you can play taylor swift's songs on
01:35:36 i'll write that down but you can also now play joe rogan podcast oh cool and they gave him 100 million dollars so
01:35:44 that that's  you know that's awesome it's yeah  but the thing i've had a discussion with
01:35:51 him and i made a video about it that i took down because the toxicity is like it's hard to put into words but
01:35:59 he will give away the 100 million in a second if he ever has to compromise who he is like he doesn't i mean he already said
01:36:07 as he talked about he's made quote unquote you money a long time ago
01:36:14 he doesn't need any more money he doesn't care it's nice to have money whatever but
01:36:19 like he'll give it away so the it's nice to see when people like him at a level of celebrity
01:36:30 level success and financial success don't change at all they're just the same thing that makes you happy is
01:36:36 talking in his case talking with his friends in case of most of us really just just
01:36:41 hanging out with friends doing the things you love in his case doing the things he loves without any
01:36:51 like you know the texas way the  freedom like without any corporate bureaucracy  that rolls in and says
01:37:00 well maybe you shouldn't say you know like more than 20 times a podcast or something like that like those kinds
01:37:04 like rules like people like he says in a suit and tie they show up and say
01:37:10 stuff oddly enough people that could never to have done what he does yeah exactly and it's kind
01:37:16 of inspiring to see that and i i hope people i hope people realize how special
01:37:24 of a human he is he's inspired  like people like me like i'm just i'm a scientist right so
01:37:30 he inspired somebody like me from a very different walk of life to be like kind to others to be
01:37:38 open-minded i don't know that  it's a special dude so like people need to support that and treasure that as
01:37:45 opposed to  as opposed to be toxic about it if i mean what 
01:37:52 i just people really for a long time have told me that it would be awesome if ryan hall's on
01:37:58 goes on joe rogan i definitely think that'll be an awesome thing have you listened to joe has he been
01:38:05 a part of your life in some kind of way you know well joe's always i've i remember watching joe on fear
01:38:09 factor when i was a little kid which is cool so i've actually gotten a like from a from a
01:38:14 bird's eye view watch you know his his kind of just path through life yeah but one of the things that that i always
01:38:19 appreciate and again i barely know joe are then to shake his hand he interviewed me after the 
01:38:23 briefing in the ring after the bj penn fight but one of the things that i've always
01:38:28 admired about joe is that i think he had  money from the start i think that zero dollars is you
01:38:33 money for joe i think and that's something i respect about him a great deal um
01:38:39 because as you say it's interesting to watch it's like you you hope that  george saint pierre is like this
01:38:44 it's really neat now i'm not super close to george but we're teammates at tristar and he's never been anything but a
01:38:48 gentleman is one of those people that if you didn't know george was famous when you walked in the gym you'd have no idea
01:38:53 he's not holding court not doing it he's just you know training and he'll help out an amateur doing this if you have a
01:38:58 question for him he'll help me like i'm nobody man he he would give me advice and train me it
01:39:03 was super cool and he didn't kill me which i really appreciated he's a gentleman but  you know it's like you you meet
01:39:09 someone and you go man i'm so it's so cool that this is the guy who's the best that this is the guy who
01:39:15 who's been successful and then you go why are they successful like i said true to what they're doing they haven't
01:39:19 changed they're the same as they've been and i remember i got to try start in 2012 and george was already
01:39:24 already george st pierre but i remember watching and talking to people and they're like oh man george is the same
01:39:27 as he's always been in this neat i see him in the gym training now and again giving advice now and it seems
01:39:33 like joe has always been consistent and it's neat to watch someone not compromise on their values and not
01:39:38 change who they are and not you know periodically like you know again we all make mistakes like you have a bad day or
01:39:43 this or that an apology needs to be issued or even my bad or this or that and you're like
01:39:47 yeah they just move on they're not afraid to be themselves and they're not afraid to be wrong they're not afraid to make a
01:39:52 mistake as you as you mentioned open-minded and so i'm like so what are the correct beliefs to have about this
01:39:57 that i know going in everyone's going to be okay with what i'm saying which is usually the beginning of a
01:40:00 conversation that's going to go nowhere right and  it's it's neat to see the things i guess that he's created on
01:40:08 his own as a result of the authenticity that's there and it reminds me of like dave chappelle and
01:40:14 again i don't know i've never met dave but it's neat to see someone that's clearly again authentic in their own way
01:40:21 doing their own thing and they're because of that they're above the corporate nonsense but what's funny i
01:40:26 think the message behind all of it is hey guys we all are i can't promise you that i'm gonna have
01:40:32 money joe couldn't promise you that he's gonna have money now it ended up working out but he was above that nonsense from the jump
01:40:39 and he just continued to be above it by never giving it any mind and just going like yeah i'm gonna be a reasonable
01:40:44 person i'm gonna try to learn i'm gonna try to grow and  if i say something annoying you
01:40:49 can come and talk to me about it we get to the bottom of it and i'm like if i need to say my bed thanks appreciate it
01:40:54 you know i will and if i don't need to i'm like hey i still appreciate the talk thanks man i'll
01:40:57 shake your hand and we carry on and we go our separate ways and hopefully i'll treat you respect you treats me with respect
01:41:03 and and that's about it and i guess i think it's a lesson that it can work out no matter what you don't have to kowtow
01:41:09 to like these weird powers that be and whether you're at this level or at this level but
01:41:14 you can live your life the way that you want and as you mentioned talk with your friends hang out be happy and it
01:41:17 just so happens that that resonates with people it actually reminds me of like speaking to mit
01:41:22 and being in boston is like good will hunting you know like again that's what he really want to do he could have
01:41:27 gone this way could have gone that way and it was an interesting story but it's like this person wants to hang out with his
01:41:33 buddies and wants to do other things and again happens to be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these other things
01:41:39 but there was it i guess it's like at least in my mind a story of authenticity as well
01:41:43 and it was both the same thing in the robin williams character and i i just think that that's a message because watch
01:41:49 watching things occur on the internet as they do now things so many things playing out in the public eye
01:41:54 i feel like so many private or otherwise formerly private discussions and disputes and and
01:41:59 you know interactions now become they all have a a well what is this going to say when it goes public
01:42:04 so how can i couch what i'm saying or how can i word this in a way that's going to get people on my side to use
01:42:08 the right buzzwords and not use the wrong buzzwords and it's just neat to see people you
01:42:13 know in their own way flip the bird to that because i just think that that's that's just not how a human being is meant to
01:42:23 i'm curious what you think about the thing that recently has you know me like hosting this podcast i sometimes
01:42:30 think about like who should i talk to and not in terms of like it's the the old hitler question
01:42:39 now hitler i would definitely talk to because post world war ii because everyone knows he's evil the
01:42:45 question whether you talk to hitler in 1937 like when people who are really students of what's
01:42:54 going on understand that this is a very dangerous human being but a large number of part of the world
01:43:01 they're like well he's a leader who cares for germany so the question i have it's interesting to
01:43:09 me it involves a particular person named who also lives in austin texas named alex jones
01:43:14 i don't know if you're familiar with the guy i am familiar with mr jones  i've actually recently just listened
01:43:21 to infowars like one episode of his  show i guess that he does every day
01:43:28 and it kind of reminds me of a time in college when i drank too much tequila there's no turning back
01:43:37 like no it's like like the the mistakes you make that like it it it's i mean you don't know where
01:43:42 you're gonna wake up you don't know who you're gonna kill or not kill or steal or rob
01:43:50 it it's it's unclear so that that it felt like i was getting pulled into a dark place where
01:43:57 pretty much everybody is a pedophile that's trying to control the world so bill gates definitely is a pedophile
01:44:05 everybody in power anybody in power there's a kind of a deep skepticism about power and a conspiratorial way to
01:44:13 see the world where everything is like dark forces in all corners it's like the way you feel when you're a
01:44:21 kid that there's a monster hiding in the closet which is also why you leap over the bed from like four feet away
01:44:27 there's a strategy yes so but he says that you're just being weak you need to look under the bed
01:44:32 under the bed there's monsters and we need to be aware of them because they're growing they're multiplying you should be and
01:44:37 they're touching children they're touching children exactly so it all connects
01:44:44 but the the i when i listened to him and i thought about like do i want to when i listened to his conversation with joe
01:44:56 rogan the two times he talked on there to me it was somehow entertaining like it was fun to
01:45:04 listen to it's fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours because it's almost like theater like this is
01:45:13 what i talked to joe about when people try to censor alex jones joe says that the people who try to censor him
01:45:21 don't give enough credit to the intelligence of human beings to like understand like that like what a person
01:45:30 says on a large platform does not necessarily is not the truth you can be a madman and say crazy things
01:45:37 and people are intelligent enough to hear  certain things be when they're said like the earth is flat they can they can be
01:45:46 intelligent enough not to all of a sudden start believing that the earth is flat
01:45:51 like they they're intelligent enough to sort of select different ideas and be able to enjoy the
01:45:57 theater of a particular ridiculous over-the-top conversation without being sort of influenced where they
01:46:02 start believing like toxic set of beliefs now other kinds of people especially now
01:46:13 with cancer culture that say well you don't want to give platform to crazy people that that ultimately whose
01:46:19 beliefs might lead to dangerous consequences like and i see it very often now with
01:46:27 conspiracy theories that go that go like way too far like for example would i i'm not i haven't looked into it
01:46:35 so i'm sorry i will look into it but  it hurts my heart to see that on bill gates
01:46:46 in my opinion the person who has saved and improved more lives than probably any human in history
01:46:52 literally because of the money he's invested in helping like just just the work he's done on
01:46:57 like malaria in africa the number of people he's helped is huge and yet
01:47:04 every interview anything you see now on bill gates everyone is calling him i believe
01:47:09 haven't looked into it but i believe everyone's calling him a pedophile i don't know the full
01:47:13 structure of it but it's it's just a very it feels like an army of like it feels like it's hundreds
01:47:20 of thousands of people that's what it feels like it might be a much smaller percentage
01:47:24 but it feels like a huge number of people are calling them a pedophile so that's the
01:47:28 that's the flip side if you allow if you give platform to conspiracy theories like that
01:47:33 then you start to have bigger and bigger percent of the population believe in these crazy things
01:47:39 i just i wanted to put it out there because i don't know what to think of that if you put yourself in joe
01:47:44 rogan's shoes if you put yourself in my shoes if you put yourself just in your own shoes
01:47:51 i'm in my shoes right now great if you're staying your shoes just stay in your shoes can i have your work
01:47:58 would you talk would you give platform to people like alex jones would would you talk to somebody like
01:48:04 alex jones or or not  i yes i would and i feel very strongly
01:48:11 about this honestly well i think that it's it's an interesting thing and i
01:48:17 i would just say a lot of times i can understand you know very very clearly why people would take issue with the idea of i
01:48:25 guess what they perceive to be amplifying this man's voice this man's reach you know as as a
01:48:33 demonstrable negative but i think you know when you take a step back further 
01:48:40 the the cure is more damaging than the disease and significantly so i guess i think that
01:48:48 i'm very very wary of i think being where you mentioned alex jones being wary of power and
01:48:53 people with it that's a lot of times there's a lot of truth and validity to crazy things that people say
01:49:01 it's the conspiracy theories that stick are the ones that sound credible at least quasi-credible in some
01:49:07 aspect and it's almost like it seems to me like an anchor in people's mind and it is also funny to me obviously the
01:49:12 the bill gates it's so funny to tar people with things like pedophile racist
01:49:18 rapist like these are things that we're basically trying to pick words that no one can ever support someone who does
01:49:22 these things yeah and that's you know and that changes year by year
01:49:29 currently pedophile is totally in as a thing to call somebody just just as a it used to be communist
01:49:35 or marxist cleveland browns fan you know like come on you know who
01:49:40 actually nobody likes the bronze so yeah i'll agree i felt that that was that's why i picked one that's the trick
01:49:44 is you find a group of people that nobody likes we're good here all right that's the move but  yeah
01:49:50 that's a creepy thing though because that is that is the creepy thing it's like people are always looking for
01:49:55 groups of people are always looking for and i find this really deeply disturbing like hey so who's the guy that we can
01:50:00 all get away with you know just treating like dirt who's the guy that i can be a dick to
01:50:06 i can just walk up and punch in the face and no one's gonna say anything yeah and it's even if i you know people do that with
01:50:13 whether it's literal nazis or someone that i called nazi you know i guess what's the bigger issue
01:50:19 this person's ridiculous beliefs or what i'm doing and you mentioned hitler before and
01:50:24 obviously mein kampf being a you know like the outline for some of the things he did later and when the evil was it
01:50:28 always there did it did it take root later on or to flourish later on
01:50:35 but was was adolf hitler a problem because he had crazy ideas or because he did things i think it's because it's not i
01:50:42 think i know it's because he did things now if i'm going to start punishing thought crime
01:50:46 i i'm going to have to start punishing thought crime and that's a terrifying concept even if i'm right about the certain
01:50:52 about the objectively correct about the things that i decide to call out of bounds who put me in charge and made me arbiter
01:50:58 of good taste and how long until i decide that something else is is out of bounds it's always a
01:51:03 sliding scale or it's always just a sliding standard and i i find that that you know to be
01:51:09 more of a concern than people doing crazy things because i guess if you mention alex jones you know putting out
01:51:15 ridiculous ridiculous ideas ridiculous theories i think that most people don't look at alex jones as a credible person
01:51:20 no i'm not going to pretend to be deeply read into all of his beliefs or the things that he's trying to peddle
01:51:26 but there's plenty of things that are quasi mainstream that i think on with this side or that
01:51:31 side that maybe not comparably ridiculous but are yeah you know particularly in
01:51:35 hindsight or you know are we're not or silly and i guess  the idea of of getting a group of people
01:51:44 together to decide what we're not going to tolerate is a very very tricky thing and i think
01:51:48 that you know it reminds me of law or you know even you know religion when it
01:51:54 gets to like what are the things that we don't like how do we feel about rape it's like no under no circumstances
01:52:00 is that an acceptable behavior murder no that's not acceptable behavior killing i don't know kind of depends on the
01:52:06 situation are you at war were you justified were you acting in self-defense okay so it's not now murder is a
01:52:13 specific type of killing the same way you know other things should be a specific type of something
01:52:17 else but i guess we we draw a line of murder we say if you want to exist in our society you can't do this
01:52:22 this cannot be done and then we go theft if someone said hey i murdered that guy can you understand
01:52:27 where i'm coming from i might say yeah i'll hear you out doesn't mean that i think you're right
01:52:31 but i'm like have you ever been wronged so deeply that you could imagine that you could kill someone i'm like no
01:52:35 i haven't but i could conceptualize someone doing that and i'm like yeah okay and you still need to go you
01:52:40 still need to face you know criminal justice as we have it in our system at least that's how we've decided yeah
01:52:45 there's it's interesting you have to be able to like there's if you look at the history of discourse
01:52:50 in this country i think it's still true but i'm not sure it's changed since 9 11.
01:52:58 is  it used to be impossible to criticize a soldier it was easier to criticize war it was harder to criticize soldiers
01:53:10 for allowing themselves to be the tools of war i tend to be maybe it's the russian
01:53:14 upbringing it's the it's the combat thing i tend to romanticize war and soldiers i see soldiers as heroes
01:53:25 but i've also heard people that not only say that soldiers are the war is bad they say
01:53:33 soldiers are bad what's their argument it's it's the kind of a libertarian view that they're basically slaves to evil
01:53:44 right war is evil and they're they're giving they are suspending their moral and
01:53:51 ethical like as like duties as a human being to become the tools of evil that's sort of the argument if you see war as evil
01:54:01 i mean i think it's useful to hear that but there for a long part in history that was completely unacceptable
01:54:09 same with abortion if you see abortion as murder i mean if i classify it in that if i put it in that in that basket
01:54:21 it starts we're living in the midst from that perspective could you feel how people could be deeply upset by abortion
01:54:29 you know of course looked at from a different perspective you say i don't believe it to be murder
01:54:34 that's not how i see it then you go oh well if that's the genesis of your your thought process
01:54:39 then you're like yeah okay now i see how we can come to a different thing but i guess we
01:54:44 go well abortion is murder period therefore if you support it you support murder that's a convenient way for me to tar
01:54:50 you right but i guess that's kind of coming back to the alec jones i'm i'm this
01:54:55 nuance it's  you have to have the nuance in these kinds of conversations and i have to be willing to have the
01:55:00 conversation and i have to be willing to sit down if i can't sit down across from like the most
01:55:05 violently racist angry hypothetical internet you know conceived person that none of us have ever actually met in real life
01:55:12 but or hopefully not you know and go like well of course i believe that this person's
01:55:16 wrong but allow me to change do my best i'll hear him out and i'll go no i can go point by point and explain why this
01:55:20 guy or this girl is wrong and hopefully bring them over to a more reasonable position where they will have
01:55:25 better beliefs and they will like objectively better beliefs and beliefs that will
01:55:29 will and they'll treat other people better why would i want to marginalize this person now i might not want to talk
01:55:34 i might want to invite them to my barbecue if they're acting like a jerk all the time
01:55:37 but how could i would it not make the world a better place if i'd hear them out and they go look if you're going to
01:55:41 sit down and talk with me we're going to have to have a discussion i'll hear what you have to say and if i can't
01:55:48 if i can explain to someone why their ridiculous belief is wrong then i might i must not be so confident
01:55:53 in my position and i guess that's where i come back to the alex jones thing as you mentioned you know with 
01:55:58 with bill gates and and you're much more familiar with with the specifics of all the good that he's done but you know
01:56:02 again he's been an unbelievable force for good you know in this world you can list a b c d things that the man
01:56:10 has has done that his foundation has done and you know positive things and then the
01:56:15 other people could speculate about ridiculous crazy levels of of evil but you can't produce any evidence for that
01:56:21 sort of thing because if you could the man would find himself in trouble you know and anyway i
01:56:25 guess what i would would say is that why you can't force me to accept the truth the same way you could write
01:56:32 down two plus two equals four on a piece of paper and show me how it works and i could say
01:56:36 nah but that doesn't make it not true and you've still given yourself an opportunity to present your case you've
01:56:40 presented it to me and you've also for anyone listening and watching you know you've been able to critically
01:56:47 assess what's gone on you know or critically address back and forth you know kind of the the discourse
01:56:51 and i think that you almost you're making your case for the public so i guess like
01:56:56 you know when it comes to just never not engaging with these people that seems to me to be cowardly and i think that
01:57:00 that's a something that we're seeing in society right now i think i think we're seeing a
01:57:04 crisis of courage in society all over the place and i think that's where we're seeing poor
01:57:10 leadership i think we're seeing understandable things happening everywhere but we need stronger voices
01:57:14 and stronger stronger beliefs that have a conviction and are willing to engage with others
01:57:20 not just turning into a shouting contest and not i didn't win because there's more of me oh i voted i outvoted you
01:57:25 that's nice too but that's a stand-in for bullets that's saying i won because there's more of me that doesn't mean
01:57:29 that i'm right because plenty of horrible and unpopular now things have been very very deeply
01:57:34 popular in the past and would have won a popular vote does that make them right i'd said clearly not so i guess  you'd
01:57:41 hope that we engage with these people and that you can do your best to bring them over to a more reasonable position
01:57:45 if you believe that you have one and if you can't well at least you made the effort and i think that that's
01:57:49 something where martial arts shows the value it's like or do you know if you're going to go win your next fight
01:57:53 i'm like i have no idea i will proceed forward with with full effort and and
01:57:58 you know i will fight with dignity i'll fight with honor and i'll fight with courage and i i'll use everything that i have
01:58:03 and i will play within the bounds of the game and that's that and the result will be what it'll be but
01:58:08 i'll walk into and out of that ring with my head held high because i will know that i did my part i did my job
01:58:13 the outcome the specific outcome is not in my control it's just strongly in my influence and and i think that that's something
01:58:19 that helped me that martial arts has taught me because other times even when i was successful
01:58:23 or unsuccessful i would focus on if i won i'm i won therefore i'm good i lost therefore i'm bad this other guy
01:58:29 won or lost therefore as opposed to evaluating their method and i think it's so easy when we're
01:58:34 taking a bird's-eye view of things to not evaluate how someone's doing things you're not
01:58:38 evaluating my process you're simply evaluating my outcome and i could have stumbled into something very very good
01:58:42 or very very bad and we can look back and i think that's the value of history i mean i don't mean
01:58:46 to get on my dang high horse but it's like that's the value of history we can see the unbroken chain or
01:58:50 the chain of events that led us somewhere and then only with only with the eyes of history can we truly
01:58:56 evaluate things unless we're in the room watching it happen and i guess that's again where we start
01:59:00 to go most of the big bad scary things that have happened in history that are done
01:59:06 particularly on an industrial scale which implies governmental power and things like that or these the equivalent
01:59:12 involve groups of people getting together and going hey we're not going to deal with that guy
01:59:17 giant groups of people so maybe we're right this time but maybe we're wrong next time and i
01:59:22 guess i would be back to the gandalf putting on the one ring i would be very very hesitant even if we thought we were
01:59:25 in the right to simply try to try to marginalize just on general principle even people like
01:59:32 alex jones whom on their face are pretty ridiculous like you said you should sit down with adolf
01:59:36 hitler and talk to the man i agree with you to play a little devil's advocate
01:59:44 is alex jones might be a bad example but if we look at because he has a face he is a human he's
01:59:48 a real person there's also trolls on the internet 4chan the worry i have with
02:00:00 those folks is that and there might be parallels to martial arts is they practice guerrilla warfare
02:00:07 meaning they don't necessarily want to arrive at the truth they just always want to cut at the ankles
02:00:15 of the powerful like they want to always break down the powerful and even if they
02:00:21 i mean it's they turn everything into a game so they let's see if we can make the world let's
02:00:28 see if we can make a trend that bill gates is a pedophile right they make it into a game they get
02:00:33 excited about this game they see the powerful let's see if we can convince that like who is the most
02:00:39 positive person we can think of let's see if we can turn them into evil and they've tried that with like
02:00:45 with like everybody and some and it seems to stick and they're good at it assam would argue whatever you think
02:00:52 about our current president that he has some elements of that which is he's figured out whatever this music of social
02:01:01 discourse that's going on he's figured out how to always troll the mainstream
02:01:08 like flow of consciousness that's the the media he always kind of says stuff that annoys
02:01:14 a very large number of people and he enjoys that because it's like taking the powerful taking the way
02:01:19 things were before and he like shakes it up by saying the most inappropriate thing almost on
02:01:26 purpose or instinctually and so on the problem i have with that is that doesn't the powerful thing there is it 
02:01:38 brings the power the those in power down a notch that's a great thing the negative thing is it doesn't push us
02:01:44 closer to a nuanced careful rigorous discourse towards truth it's like showing up to a party
02:01:50 and just like starting to yell it doesn't create a good conversation
02:01:57 it just makes everything into a game where truth doesn't even seem like a thing we can even hope
02:02:02 to achieve like that makes sense and i guess as you mentioned it'll come back to another
02:02:06 movie because i don't do books and do movies some people just want to watch the world burn right
02:02:12 and i guess there's that's a creepy creepy you know kind of urge that some people have and it also is
02:02:16 some people you're like hey would you like to throw a brick through that glass window and you're like
02:02:21 yeah sure like no i'm not going to do that because i think about what's going to what's going to what's
02:02:25 going to occur like something's going to be hurt someone's property not going to do it versus
02:02:28 hey you want to see what'll happen like yeah sure you know kids are always like i have my son he just
02:02:34 grabbed spider-man and dropped small table spider-man fell my spider-man didn't fall shawn like he
02:02:38 dropped him you knocked him off the table and he'll grin and basically  you know it's it's an interesting
02:02:46 thing like you said like playing that p these people are appealing to and you know and also almost like the
02:02:51 little dog factor of like i people do want to watch the powerful get taken down a notch for
02:02:55 all the good and the not good of that because plenty of people it seems to me that have found their way to
02:03:02 incredibly high positions some some have just found themselves there and many many many many many people
02:03:07 you know men and women of of all backgrounds are brilliant and have worked hard and yeah of course there's
02:03:10 luck and there's there's luck into everything there you know lebron james in spite of being the
02:03:15 best basketball player on god's green earth is fortunate that he didn't get hit by a
02:03:19 car you know it's fortunate they didn't tear his knee you know but thankfully we get to see
02:03:25 all these things you know but i i guess  it's if people don't have any skin in the
02:03:32 game you never know what they're gonna do and i think that's the problem with the internet
02:03:36 you know that people get to be nameless be faceless that's why guerrilla fighters are outside of the
02:03:40 bounds of war like you don't have a uniform on you're like i don't know who you're from
02:03:45 you don't get the same treatment that a soldier gets for and people well that's crazy
02:03:50 actually there's reasons for this because otherwise people are able to assail things and
02:03:55 there's no there's no one responsible there's no way to go and say hey where's where did this come from what's the root
02:04:00 of this what how can i address this and i think that's the problem of the internet's problem on twitter's problem
02:04:04 places like 4chan i wouldn't mind seeing that type of stuff go away if i'm frank but that's not the same
02:04:08 thing as people with a face people with people who are willing to stand there
02:04:14 and say hi my name is so and so even if i have ridiculous beliefs hopefully you know people will hear me out and then
02:04:20 if i'm wrong educate me but i i guess you hope that the real i guess in my mind antidote to all of
02:04:25 this silliness is education and and i think that that's something that we're
02:04:30 you know critical thinking is is not necessarily i went to school in america and you know i feel very fortunate but
02:04:36 critical thinking is not something that's that's focused on i mean and it's it's tough it's almost like talking about
02:04:41 jiu-jitsu it's tough to teach critical thinking when i don't know any words you have to teach me techniques you can't
02:04:44 teach me to be an artist but recognize that the techniques are the beginning not the end
02:04:49 ultimately it's the artistry that we're searching for not just the not just the science or the or the by
02:04:55 rote memorization and i guess you know you'd hope that people's ability to think critically and
02:04:59 recognize that majority rule or whoever's loudest does not mean that they're right by any stretch of the
02:05:03 imagination and we don't appeal to that and we don't bow to that will help them to help inoculate them
02:05:09 against the ridiculous things that come out of these places these dark places that that are objectively not great but the i guess
02:05:17 all circling back if even if we swatted these you know these bad things out of existence right now
02:05:24 we've got to be very very careful doing that because it's who's doing the swatting this political group that's in power
02:05:29 right now the people that support our current president would maybe feel a certain way the people that support
02:05:33 another option would feel differently as to what exactly defines toxic and i you know i guess that
02:05:41 that's what gives me pause yeah and but also the grace thing i tend to believe that the the
02:05:48 technology you said education but the the platforms we use like twitter and the reddit and all these platforms have a
02:05:54 role to play to teach us grace meaning they ins they should help us incentivize
02:06:03 the kind of behavior that is incentivized in real life like being a dick in real life is not incentivized
02:06:11 like one-on-one interaction like there's cases where it is but usually being kind to each other
02:06:17 is incentivized on the internet it's not like you get likes for being for mocking people in a funny in a
02:06:24 humorous way and it can be dark kind of mocking depending on the community you can go you can go to the appearance
02:06:30 if somebody's a little fat or a little too skinny you can comment on their appearance the hair
02:06:36 the way their hair looks like the appearance stuff it could be on the people comment all the time
02:06:43 on the  level of eloquence of my speech go yourself i like it it's creepy though watching
02:06:50 watching previously like this used to be lowbrow though like people doing this type of stuff it's creepy watching like
02:06:55 our political figures get into this type of game yes but again it's a little bit refreshing right it's
02:07:02 a the is that he would shake up the the people who wear suits usually
02:07:14 the like if you're from dc i remember like showing up i actually didn't wear what i usually
02:07:19 wear in dc because i was like everybody's wearing a suit and tie when i was like giving talks and stuff except
02:07:23 for mudge who wears jeans and a t-shirt doesn't give a damn
02:07:31 mudge is  a forever renegade  but i don't even remember what  oh yeah so
02:07:36 my hope with trump was that huge shake up that system just say like like  to inject new ideas to inject
02:07:43 new energy of course the way it turned out is different but like there's 
02:07:49 it turns out that you might want to have somebody who's like like an andrew yang type character
02:07:55 who is full of ideas that are very different and inject the energy new energy into the system
02:08:03 through youthful new ideas versus through the troll that like that's very good at sort of mocking and like
02:08:12 playing outside the the rules of the game but trump did reveal powerfully i don't know what to think of it
02:08:21 that it's just a game and you don't have to play by the rules that's both inspiring and dark deeply
02:08:27 depressing right yeah and i don't know what to do with it i don't i mean the same
02:08:33 i'm not drawing parallels not drawing parallels between our president and adolf hitler but it certainly and
02:08:40 there's a lot of in history a lot of positive and a lot of negative things happen
02:08:46 when charismatic leaders realize they don't have to play by the rules you can just flip the table it's the
02:08:53 that   kevin spacey show no house cards house of cards where you just flip the
02:08:59 table or whatever you don't have to play by the rules of the chess game you can flip the table one wonders if that's
02:09:04 always been done in private you know i guess because that's i mean even look obviously the united states is
02:09:09 a as a republic but we had we had bush then we had clinton and we had more bush than we had
02:09:15 president obama then we were about to have another clinton that's fairly creepy yeah even on its own but
02:09:24 now we added another i mean i'm sure we'll have a generation of trumps no gee we  you know i'm russian so
02:09:34 i think we humans like kings still and queens there's something we're attracted to the the thing we
02:09:41 talked about coaches there's something in us that longs towards that authoritarian
02:09:46 control one of the beautiful things about america the second amendment  is  we also like
02:09:54 individual freedom that's one of the one of the unique aspects at the founding of this country and
02:09:58 still and for me is the beacon of hope that  somehow there's the fire freedom burns
02:10:09 in there like that texas feel that i that gives me hope the fu energy that revolts against the power which as
02:10:17 we discussed power corrupts and ultimately leads to sort of  degradation of the whoever's
02:10:26 ruling is the people it's interesting though like it seems to me maybe i'm just i don't know if i'm reading this
02:10:30 properly when i when i see it but it's it seems to me that that like you said that that you know
02:10:36 flip the bird i'm gonna do me within reason like as long as i'm not hurting you 
02:10:42 is idea that that very much at least in my mind defines the american ideal or at least part of the consciousness of the
02:10:47 united states is is under attack to a certain extent you know in
02:10:52 if only like i can think to like you know maybe a generation behind us it's it's becoming
02:10:59 more collectivist yeah you know for all the good and also the not good of that and it's  you know not in
02:11:04 not in terms not in terms of policy at this point but just in terms of like 
02:11:09 the consciousness and i wonder if that's a an internet thing you know people are more in touch with one another than they've
02:11:14 as far as i can tell they've ever been at least more than in my lifetime and  you know the rest of the world
02:11:20 seems much closer than it did you know living in virginia california seems very far away being on
02:11:25 the internet it's just right there i can hear about it i can see it i can i can interact with people from
02:11:30 there you know i remember  you know being in tennessee at  you know one time and then
02:11:36 and reading about you know events taking place in you know the middle east and it just seemed like a mile away it
02:11:41 seemed like a unbelievably far distance and then another time when you're in dc you just
02:11:45 feel like oh you read about something happening in paris and it just feels like it's just right around the corner
02:11:51 because dc is a seat of a seat of power where things are just occurring all the time and
02:11:56  you know i guess you you wonder about that's where i come back to the group decisions to
02:12:02 not listen to this person or to cancel this or to you know we all the moral majority shall do the
02:12:07 following as opposed to as long as you're not hurting me and long as you're not hurting anyone
02:12:12 else i have to let you do i have to let you be on general principle even if i don't like you i'm very free to not like
02:12:17 you i'm free to speak out against you but i'm not it is not within my right or and not
02:12:22 with it and it's not i i would not be right to attempt to attack you
02:12:27 and that is an interesting thing though when we see words being redefined or words being defined whether it's
02:12:32 toxicity whether it's violence if i think that what you're saying is is your speech is by itself
02:12:38 you know a violence or a precursor to violence i'm justified in doing all sorts of things
02:12:43 you know and and that creeps me out significantly because again even if it ends up being pointed in a good
02:12:48 direction initially it's only a matter of time and actually that brings me to 
02:12:55 another dune oh yeah i got all day how much are they paying you but wait about say the  the frank herbert
02:13:01 estate not enough frankly oh let's see and how many books are there in dune
02:13:08 that's a gen question you're also a fan of i read the whole series but not a couple of the i read all the
02:13:15 prequels as well it was the exception of a couple is there a book one for dune dune it
02:13:20 would be book one and even the prequels it's still all better if you start
02:13:25 like i read dune and then read the original what is it six and then i went back and started to read
02:13:30 something like just like watching star wars you want to start at episode four or whatever yeah
02:13:36 i think so that's the way that's the move and then stop at six call it a day watch the mandalorian and
02:13:41 but well i thought you're not walking back here no i like the mandalorian yeah that is
02:13:46 what i said yeah i was told that i was heartless for not liking baby yoda boy
02:13:52 we don't talk about a couple of the movies not including the middle or in the middle and it's fine it's the
02:13:57 more recent movies that we don't like to talk about yeah oh the what's his name the the goofy guy  ryan
02:14:05 no no no the creature the goofy creature with the jar jar yeah jar jar do you ever see the the the
02:14:10 jar jar binks is actually like the dark lord of the sith theory that fixed the whole initial trilogy
02:14:15 we're like he's he's like goofing around and like making it all the way through battles and when
02:14:18 you're like wait a minute he oops his way he walks over to a pool does a triple
02:14:23 backflip falls in you're like it's just bizarre this is the this is the alex jones
02:14:29 theory of of star wars he's actually running one that actually was like hey we should vote in chancellor chancellor palpatine
02:14:35 or senator palpatine like right before they put jar jar in charge first off what did they think was gonna happen
02:14:40 and second off that was i just think that'd be great like oops oh man i guess he's the emperor now
02:14:45 that would have been great but actually to the to the cancel and all the other stuff again
02:14:49 it's just you'd hope that it gives pause and i think about this for fighting because a lot of times
02:14:53 i'll use this example people and people like fight fans and you know like ufc they love people that run out and
02:14:59 try to murder each other and it's entertaining and it's super entertaining but you know floyd mayweather doesn't resonate with
02:15:05 people as much it's like people start i remember the time when floyd was not as popular now people think people
02:15:10 love floyd because he's 50-0 floyd and oh man and finally he had so much success that we all can't
02:15:15 help but recognize the man's genius and greatness but prior to that oh he's boring he's this he's that
02:15:21 he fights you know with he's circumspect he's cautious he's he's pressing he's intelligent deeply intelligent and
02:15:28  when you watch people go out and try to murder each other you can flip a coin 100 times and
02:15:33 you know you can get you could be lucky enough to get 100 heads but it's still a coin flip
02:15:37 and i think that that's what's going on all the time is you know people are getting an outcome
02:15:41 that they want but it wasn't a well thought out situation and that's why you'll win
02:15:45 by five in a row by knockout and then lose three in a row and then people will go well what happened to that guy he
02:15:49 used to be so great no he's doing what he's always been doing it's just it was getting great
02:15:53 outcomes on a coin flip prior and it's getting negative outcomes on a coin flip now but 
02:15:59 i guess what i would say is it watches it's interesting watching you know i guess societal beliefs become
02:16:06 such a a thing that we're almost adopting on a religious level if we're not careful
02:16:10 and if if when i say religious level i mean like like pan life like this is guiding all of my choices
02:16:15 for all the good and the bad of that and this is the dune quote is when religion and politics travel on the same card the
02:16:20 writers believe that nothing can stand in their way their movements become headlong faster
02:16:24 and faster and faster they put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget that the precipice does not
02:16:29 show itself to the man in the blind rush until it's too late and i think that that's again the the
02:16:34 pause we go oh man thank goodness we have this guy that wants to rebuild germany he'll put us back where we need
02:16:38 to be and you stop questioning any your own judgment your own
02:16:44 just you start you stop thinking essentially right i'm not allowed to question this oh
02:16:48 of course this is correct of course this girl of course i'm right i intended to do right so of course my actions are
02:16:53 correct i mean how many times have any of us intend to do something helpful and ended up doing something less and you
02:16:59 know plenty of people who intend to do harm could by accident do something decent and i guess it's
02:17:05 like you know i'm not saying anything you know terribly terribly you know insightful but it's just one of those where
02:17:10 it's hard it's hard to say in the moment and that's where you hopefully caution you would counsel
02:17:14 some degree of caution and  that that's what worries me with with people deciding that we're all so
02:17:21 right about this or we're also right about that and attempting to rather than win the argument
02:17:26 silence the counter-argument no matter how crazy it may seem because i just think that that idea even
02:17:31 when it's pointed in a good direction initially it's only a matter of time you're amongst many things
02:17:40 a jujitsu black belt one of the things that people are really curious about white belts and blue belts and jiu jitsu
02:17:47 but also people haven't tried the art is what does it take to be a jiu jitsu black belt
02:17:52 i think that you know everyone's journey is a little bit different but the one thing that the it was a calvin coolidge
02:18:00 quote you know determination persistence is the only thing that that will win in the end it will
02:18:05 always win in the end not brilliance not toughness not education it's it's persistence and i think that
02:18:13 having the belief that no matter what happens to me i will proceed forward and i will i will figure
02:18:18 out how to make this happen hell or high water i think is the one thing that ties together all of the people that i've
02:18:22 ever met that made it through whatever it was that they were going through
02:18:28 because you know sometimes you can get lucky and you can have an easy time or and that luck could be you had a good
02:18:33 situation it could be i mean like in the obvious sense of like where you're living where you're
02:18:36 training what's going on you had a good situation you're un unbelievably athletic oh you're
02:18:41 you're going to be an astronaut you're brilliant and an olympic athlete you know like well
02:18:45 that's a fantastic situation you know you won the genetic lottery and i've worked hard as well but you also
02:18:49 won the genetic lottery it's a determination is the one thing though because
02:18:55 that person could have a very easy go of it initially and then tear their knee and then they're no longer the the
02:19:01 superhuman physical specimen that they were the only thing that will keep them going is persistence and i think that that um
02:19:08 i would just say that persistence to say i'll just put one foot in front of the other and sometimes i can see the path ahead
02:19:14 and sometimes it's beyond my vision but i will not stop i may even slow down but i won't stop
02:19:20 and that's the only thing that i can say that i've seen tie everyone together because there's so many ways to the top
02:19:25 of any mountain and there's so many different personalities and skills and backgrounds involved
02:19:31 but everyone everyone carries on so at the core the foundational advice is just don't quit
02:19:36 just keep going that's the lesson of martial arts i think you know we think it's like how to be
02:19:42 strong or how to be how to win but in reality it's like how to persist how to endure because it's
02:19:47 all of us have been beaten so many times and gotten beaten up so many times and thought about quitting have i ever
02:19:52 thought about quitting absolutely have i ever quit never i will never ever quit ever i can
02:19:56 say you might not be out i will be damned if i quit what's the darkest moment is it injury related like is that
02:20:04 is it  so like to me like two possibilities i've fortunately never been seriously injured but i think
02:20:12 that's a dark place to be like having to be out for many months  for as jen was saying like with a
02:20:19 head injury especially like the uncertainty that's one and then the other side is if you have
02:20:29 big ambitions as a competitor realizing that you're not as good like those those doubts were like i kind of suck
02:20:39 how am i supposed to be a world the greatest fighter of all time if i if if like several people in the
02:20:46 gym are kicking my ass those are the two things that paralyzing i think
02:20:52 that everyone's darkest moment is maybe different looking from the outside for ryan i wouldn't say that he's had injuries
02:20:59 and he said bad ones i wouldn't say that was his darkest moment i think for me i would say some my head
02:21:06 injury was my darkest moment absolutely and i have torn my acl twice i've torn my shoulders four times i've
02:21:11 had lots of surgeries for me the orthopedic injuries were not the most
02:21:19 difficult it was the brain injury for others that might be the case for them maybe they've never
02:21:24 experienced an injury and maybe for them that's their darkest moment from the outside obviously orion can
02:21:30 speak to this more but for ryan i think it was the inability to to perform at certain
02:21:36 points to the upper the missing of opportunities that for him from my perspective watching him
02:21:41 go through and having seen various points of his growth from from early purple bought on i think the
02:21:47 hardest time for him looking in obviously was when he would hit moments where he wasn't able to perform
02:21:54 for various reasons he couldn't get fights he was having difficulties there i think that
02:22:00 that was the hardest point for him did you did you think like with the head injury that you might
02:22:05 not never be able to do jiu jitsu again yeah i mean i i mine was very was really bad and it
02:22:09 was just the one hit but i had a looping memories for seven months didn't know it because
02:22:15 when your brain's messed up you're not even aware that you're looping and so i saw two different neurologists
02:22:23 i find like it took a very long time i didn't know if i was going to be able to have like linear thoughts or
02:22:29 read a book i didn't know at certain points if i could listen to music again you know without it making my head hurt
02:22:35 and so  it was almost two years before i woke up in the morning without a headache
02:22:42 just waking up before i even start my day and so that so that's even bigger than jujitsu that's just life
02:22:48 that's just that's just hard and i think that you can experience so many things i've had all these injuries
02:22:56 we lost the baby when i was 15 15 weeks and we've had all these experiences and what the hardest point for me
02:23:03 not saying all those things weren't hard but it's kind of like as you go through these you just realize
02:23:08 like life goes on and you have to keep working at it and you have to keep going and you asked me earlier offline did i feel
02:23:15 depressed and not from my head injury i don't think that at least in the moment i had a
02:23:21 any recognition of that it's kind of like but i think different people's personalities i have kind of the like
02:23:28 buckle down and just keep going and sometimes it's not until lots of time later that you realize wow
02:23:33 that was really hard because you're just struggling to live and and function and do the things that
02:23:38 you need to do alone do you mind jumping on just like this part of the conversation just for a few minutes it's
02:23:45 over do you mind you know just sitting together oh no no just for a little bit sorry be cool be
02:23:51 cool so we put a face to it you know  is it okay with you yeah it's fine with me if it's fine
02:23:58 by the way what was the head injury if you don't mind sharing someone hit their head dropped their
02:24:01 knee on the back of my head during training who's a lot bigger than me so one strike to the back of the head is
02:24:09 too much for someone there's a reason that's outlawed in mma right someone 50 pounds everything you drop their
02:24:14 running on the back your head once and it's that's the funny thing about getting hit right you never can really be sure
02:24:19 what's going to happen i think that's actually one of the magical parts about jiu jitsu where like
02:24:22 if you choke me if you we know what's going to occur you hit someone they might be completely
02:24:30 unharmed like you might be punching tony ferguson in the face and like he you need to hit him with a sledgehammer to
02:24:34 affect this man and then other people they could get really badly hurt which i guess
02:24:38 it's back to your point about you know street fighting and things like that and the serious serious potential you know
02:24:43 second third order consequences of any action that we take but yeah that's a that's a tricky thing
02:24:48 about getting hit how does it make you feel that like the the really shitty thing about
02:24:54 injuries to me was that like you start thinking like well if i did this one little thing different
02:25:01 like this wouldn't have happened today like one one moment changes your entire life is that
02:25:08 do you  do you think that where is that totally counterproductive you can't help but think that way when
02:25:13 you've had the amount of injuries i've had now because i've had more than most people's fair share um
02:25:19 as my orthopedic says you don't want to win that you don't want to with the contest of who's had the most
02:25:24 but since you haven't actually built me a pool yeah but i think you can't help but think
02:25:30 that way sometimes but i definitely don't think it's i think it can be facilitated if you
02:25:35 don't beat yourself up too much because thinking about why have i been subject to so many
02:25:41 injuries and and a lot of it comes to just almost all of mine in particular are
02:25:48 people a lot heavier than me so we're talk but if i've been training martial arts 15 years i'm obviously on the much
02:25:53 smaller side i'm a woman i've done thousands and thousands of rounds with people 50 pounds plus heavier than
02:25:59 me i mean years not training with anyone less than 50 which is 50 pounds is almost half my
02:26:03 body weight and when you also add testosterone the natural physiological advantages of men not just
02:26:10 are they heavier with more mass they're faster they're more explosive they're stronger if they're the same size and so i think
02:26:19 that the willingness to be in that environment over and over and over again creates a lot of strength resiliency willingness
02:26:24 to continue but it also like in order to do that you almost have to
02:26:32  for me the way i was approaching was like pretend like i wasn't more vulnerable and just be
02:26:39 willing to step in and step in and stuff take it until you make it kind of until you make it kind of yeah like i'll
02:26:44 just one day i'll be strong enough and you avoided injury for most for most of those rounds i would injure the
02:26:51 problem as ryan points out is that like you could do thousands of rounds but if one person that size that strength that
02:26:56 however reacts in a way that you don't expect it doesn't it's not like an oops it's like
02:27:00 always major do you regret any of it like i think that most no one i know has experienced
02:27:07 the degree of injuries that i've experienced and i started juice at a time when
02:27:12 in 2005 is very different than now where you have the coaches have more control over what you're doing they're more aware
02:27:19 in general about a lot of the injuries there's a lot more people who are 
02:27:26 hobbyists than when i started they were hobbyists but it was different kind of hobbyist you know than now
02:27:33 now our girls can train with other girls they don't have to do thousands of rounds with somebody
02:27:39 significantly more powerful than them and for the drawbacks and the benefits of that you know as with anything
02:27:48 so i think i think that i don't think i would go back and change it there were times
02:27:54 after one of my injuries where i said to ryan i said i quit i'm done i'm not doing this anymore i probably
02:27:58 said it more than once but there was one time i was really serious in 2012. i was really serious i tore my
02:28:05 shoulder i had i was looking at missing a big competition again the world's for
02:28:09 my second or third year in a row after injuries and i said i'd quit my job two years before and i'm like
02:28:17 i'm done and run before that had always been you know keep me focused and then he kind of said okay if you want to be done
02:28:22 be done just just have a good time no i'm really done i don't even want to train anymore
02:28:29 okay okay and then you know i think he helped facilitate a moment for me to go um
02:28:35 visit a friend some friends some girls that were doing a girls camp who are close to my size or some friends
02:28:40 of mine to go train and i was like oh wait i do love this thing it's harder for me on a daily basis but that doesn't mean i
02:28:45 don't love this thing and it really helped change my mind i started to connect with other people
02:28:50 travel more myself because previously he had done that but
02:28:55 i hadn't really done that i think there was a point where when i started youtube it was just
02:29:00 for fun i just wanted to sport after college i played sports as a kid i want to i just want to exercise i wasn't into
02:29:04 the martial arts he usually gave me a hard time about it because he was always very how can you
02:29:08 not care about martial i don't know i just want to play sports and ryan was really big into kind of the
02:29:14 philosophy side of the martial arts aspect he used to give me a hard time and i think after that moment this moment
02:29:20 where i looked at myself and i said do i want to keep doing this is when i started to appreciate
02:29:25 jiu-jitsu take it took off some of the pressure i'd been feeling i think as ryan's girlfriend but i had a
02:29:29 full-time job a long time it was never my goal to be a jiu jitsu world champion
02:29:35 and i think after that moment where i like you know i really do like this i really do want to just i had this moment
02:29:40 like any time where you're like i'm doing this for me i'm not doing this for him and i think that that's
02:29:47 i think that was really lucky for me because how often in our lives do we have a kind of a challenge
02:29:53 where we have to stop and we have to say is this really what i want how often in a relationship do you do
02:29:58 that how often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop and you really ask yourself is something really
02:30:05 difficult happen that you look and you go am i just doing this because it's convenient and easy
02:30:10 or is this what i really want to do yeah i've had those moments like this this podcast is one of those things it's like
02:30:19 you you stop and think like i actually love this and it's  i had that with jiu-jitsu too
02:30:26 i don't think i had set until like brown belt did i stop i mean yeah it's when you first
02:30:31 face real challenges you think like why am i doing this it's i think most of my progression was
02:30:39 why not i think that's the right the leap of faith and then a certain point you think like
02:30:46 what why am i doing this and if you can answer honestly that because i love it it's kind of a liberating feeling
02:30:53 it's a it's a yeah it's so it's so powerful thankful for the opportunity to be there right because you love it and yeah man
02:31:01 great gratitude it's yeah so that's it's ultimately gratitude yeah let me ask you this so ryan said like
02:31:07 what what did i took over your thing yeah this is no nobody cares about ryan i wouldn't
02:31:13 i'll photoshop him out or whatever however you edit that'd be great put sean connery's head  just like a dune
02:31:23 ad exactly  connor is that the sexiest man in sean connery in the dune universe that's my understanding
02:31:31 okay i think in any universe yeah well mind gossiping given we actually named our son after sean connery
02:31:41 he was in the rock those i love all those great lame nicholas cage oh yeah conairs face off
02:31:46 greatest movie of all time dude his accent and conair was so awesome i don't know where it's from
02:31:51 alabama i guess or something well they got like steve buscemi in there like we need steve buscemi in this
02:31:55 thing and we got him dave chappelle yeah that's right yeah he's a prisoner
02:32:02 eight ball yep greatest movie of all time should have won and dave chappelle also in blue streak with martin lawrence
02:32:08 and then  what do you call it  robin who men and sites oh robin was one of my favorites as a kid half
02:32:13 baked but rob yeah well that that's a good  wow we just listed off some really bad
02:32:19 90s movies but you take that back we're telling our age yeah so what like in your view i don't
02:32:28 mean to from like a smaller person i guess that's an interesting thing while jiu
02:32:33 jitsu is like that  small i don't yeah like with all these like  bigger
02:32:48 people you can still enjoy the art like what does it take to get a black belt to excel to quote unquote master the art
02:32:55 gosh everyone has such a different path ryan's promoted six seven people something like that and
02:33:00 i think about half of them have had have kids have families have other
02:33:08 careers at the time some of them competed a lot some of them have never
02:33:13 competed or rarely competed some have been commuted a long time some had started different places
02:33:19 everyone's had different journeys even in our own little group of seven i think only maybe only two or three were
02:33:29 high level competitors of that group at the higher belts very like brown black maybe and so it's just different for every
02:33:37 person and that's something that that you know we try to tell her since we have 400 students
02:33:42 and do we have us we don't really have anyone who's you know a stated other other than like
02:33:48 the coaches like adam but we don't have anyone that's like a stated high-level competitor as a
02:33:52 student at the moment we people look at our gym like oh it's lots of competitors there's not lots of
02:33:56 competitors it's never been lots of competitors and we've had ones and twos here and there
02:34:03 but really everybody's in it for the long term if they're in it sometimes the the high level competitors
02:34:07 are the ones that are more likely to drop off because they have a bit of success particularly at
02:34:12 blue or purple and then they realize how hard it is at brown and black and then they they have a hard time continuing
02:34:17 on that's that path and then they can't look at themselves as a non-competitive hard time continuing with jiu jitsu i think
02:34:23 whereas sometimes it's the guy who comes in as the white belt and he trains you know twice a week every week and the
02:34:29 next thing you know he's been there for two or three years like oh he's a blue bell he's a purple
02:34:33 he's a brown bell and and he's just consistent over over a long period of time and willing
02:34:37 to take the path and no two people's path is exactly the same no two people's lives are exactly
02:34:42 the same you have we have students who started as a white belt as
02:34:49 you know a young adult with no you know no responsibilities and they train all the time and then they
02:34:54 have a job you know then they graduate college and they have a job then they have married then they have kids then
02:34:57 they have different points in their careers and at different points in your life jiu jitsu will be there you know for
02:35:04 whatever way that you're willing to accept it it's place i think well that's actually
02:35:08 kind of what back to the initial question we discussed about you know what makes a warrior you know
02:35:14 and and also like what makes something or someone you know particularly impressive in my
02:35:18 mind is like  what they make out of what they have you know one of my favorite movies ever
02:35:22 as far as gump and it's obviously it's it's just if you can't  because i've heard people like
02:35:28 force gum sucks i'm like i don't like you as a person and  like you have no heart at all but
02:35:33 basically  it's the story of someone that tries hard and it's like yeah but it's it's
02:35:39 funny movie but it's like you know i guess you meet each person where they are you know and
02:35:45 obviously you want everyone needs to be pushed we all need to be pushed we need friends and people around us that push
02:35:51 us to be better versions of ourselves all the time and as you mentioned the people you spend all of your time around
02:35:57 deeply impact you and we have to be willing to be pushed it takes a leap of faith for me to trust
02:36:03 for me to put some of my self in my my you know i guess my ability my control my personal agency as it were in
02:36:09 the hands of someone else that i that i trust and and that i respect but
02:36:15 if if i can do that well again maybe i never become you know high level black belt
02:36:19 competitor but you know i had four of the things i was doing my life i also have a family i have this i have that
02:36:24 you know what that person was able to accomplish in the martial arts relative to what they were able to put in this phenomenal
02:36:29 you know other times someone could be a very successful black belt and it might might be a bum
02:36:33 because they could have been a lot more and you know they could have done more they could have focused more
02:36:39 and and there's no shame in deciding that you don't want to do that but whatever it is that you're
02:36:44 you're invested in i remember the  take it uneasy podcast and that i loved because you know i'll
02:36:49 just chill out like resting it's like vacation oh who wants to go on vacation yeah go on
02:36:53 vacation for a day or two you want to spend three weeks on vacation like i kill myself like get me out of here like
02:36:56 this is horrible this is i'm a waste of life i'm not doing anything useful right now technically
02:37:02 right now right well this is fun though it's like a one-day vacation yeah exactly but if you notice if you had
02:37:07 i'm sure you're thinking about jumping off of the building right now but if you had to if you had to talk to me for
02:37:12 you know like  three days i'm sure you'd probably shove me off the building i don't blame you i would be dead
02:37:17 but yeah five hours in but yeah but you know it is it's like you want to be pushing towards something because
02:37:22 otherwise what's the purpose of being here you know it's not just a college it's doing something useful
02:37:27 building growing as a person helping others do the same if that's within your power at any given time but i think that's
02:37:33 kind of the neat thing about martial arts is it can be many many different things to many different people
02:37:37 you know i finally for instance i was able to get a college degree let this this year
02:37:41 that which i mean it's not a big deal for most people but for me it was a big deal because i was going back and finish
02:37:47 yeah and i never envisioned ever going back and that's a hard step to to go back and
02:37:51 finish that's  it just weighs heavy on you if you don't it's interesting yeah i was just
02:37:56 i was more proud of that than most things i've ever done if i'm honest you know and it was neat and i really
02:38:00 enjoyed it and it was the process of doing it but you know are my academic credentials
02:38:06 impressive like not in the least but for me it's like it was a big deal for me personally to take that step
02:38:12 and to to go back and do that and i was i was proud of the the direction and because it would have
02:38:16 been easy like do i need to do it like no i'm you know i'm business i'll do okay i'll try
02:38:21 i'll keep fighting but i i was happy to take the time in between fights when i was when i was unbooked for an opponent to
02:38:27 do something productive rather than just i'll just hang out you know like i can still train
02:38:30 every single day but i can also train and go to school people go to the olympics while going to school
02:38:35 i can i can do martial arts and go to school one thing i gotta ask is  you know a bunch of women listen to this podcast
02:38:46 if they haven't done jiu jitsu i think it'd be kind of intimidating to  stop on the mat with a bunch of bros
02:38:54  that like enjoy somehow killing each other like how do you succeed in that environment to where you can
02:39:01 learn this art learn how to beat all those people up oh gosh is there any advice
02:39:07 i mean another way to ask that is like if if  any women listening to this are
02:39:12 interested in starting jiu-jitsu like is there advice for that journey honestly i think it's just walking in
02:39:17 the door and starting sometimes i don't know how to respond to that because i'm not i don't
02:39:22 view myself as typically anxious particularly in interactions with other people or new people shy is not a word that has been used for me
02:39:35 but if you ask my family and they joke because our son talks a lot he's advanced verbally and they're always
02:39:39 like oh well let's we know where he gets that from like because he just doesn't stop talking he
02:39:46 narrates everything he does and so they always tease because that's like i'm known for
02:39:52 for kind of talking a lot but so i haven't been typically i'm not i don't consider myself a shy
02:39:58 person so for me going into a new room a new group of people is you know there's there's always that you
02:40:03 don't really know who they are how they're going to treat you but i typical but i i don't have a lot of anxiety with
02:40:09 that so i don't if that's something that's going to put something up i don't really know how
02:40:15 to to address that particular feeling but in terms of all of the rooms i've been in i have
02:40:21 popped in the jutsu jams before i knew ryan in florida like i traveled for my jobs in germany and florida and
02:40:27 in california in places where where i don't know anyone they don't know me and i have never once had anyone
02:40:35 be anything other than than kind and solicitous and helpful and long before when i was a white belt and a blue belt and didn't
02:40:42 know anything and didn't know anyone and i just think that it's a community of people
02:40:49 that it's so cool that no matter where you go in the world i i walked into a gym in prague one
02:40:56 time where only two people spoke english and and it was just yeah it's weird you know it's weird like part of a group
02:41:02 and they're like oh let me tell you what it is being part of a cult right yeah yeah but it's like a positive cult
02:41:07 like it for sure that's what we would say yeah that's true yeah that's true i mean we do need to
02:41:16 murder every week of practice aikido i mean yeah that's this cult  true deeply believes it no but there is a
02:41:22 like if you look at different kinds of games like chess and so on like there's a skepticism i mean there's not
02:41:30 brotherhood sisterhood feeling with jiu jitsu it's like you can roll into most places even like with judo like i can see the
02:41:36 contrast like because i've trained in judo places it  it's more like tribal like you walk in
02:41:47 and like who is this like there's that kind of feeling with jiu jitsu there's  less so there is a little bit with like
02:41:53 the competitors there's always like the competitors feeling each other out usually like the blue belts 
02:42:00 but like outside of that in terms of if you don't get the if you if you walk in with the vibes of just
02:42:07 loving the art and just wanting to have a good time you're like welcome it's really cool
02:42:11 it's really fascinating it's a really great thing i think and as a woman i think you
02:42:16 you think you're walking into these rooms of these you know big strong tough guys and if anything
02:42:24 i would i would say that they're almost like much more solicitous when a woman comes in there and
02:42:28 not like they're just like hitting on you all the time you know it's just that you walk in and everyone is like oh cool
02:42:35 you want to do this thing that i love let me make sure you have a good experience and take care of you
02:42:40 and i think that's that's an experience that that i hope people have when they come into our gym and
02:42:45 and i've i've always felt when i walked into other gyms and so you know we try our best to
02:42:49 to make that comfortable and and it can be a little uncomfortable because there are when you walk into a male-dominated
02:42:55 environment there's conversations and topics there's a different style of camaraderie and
02:43:01 joking that a lot of men will do that maybe some women are more uncomfortable with i grew up with four
02:43:06 brothers so i kind of maybe was a little more desensitized to that and i worked for the department of
02:43:12 defense for for a while too so before i i i'd say you're with the government yeah
02:43:20 yeah i'm not going to ask you about ufos then because you're not going to tell me the truth
02:43:31  yeah now you just freaked out a lot of people okay  but yeah by the way where's where's
02:43:36 your school because people always ask like where   well we're outside of washington
02:43:41 dc and northern virginia and falls church you always want to pick like what's the best school if i travel to this place or
02:43:45 if i lo if i want to move to this place so that's well i mean obviously we're
02:43:50 biased but yeah we're in the washington dc area the best okay we just took a little break
02:43:56 now we're back let me ask you  one thing that a bunch of people are curious about you're one of the innovators first of
02:44:02 all you're one of the great innovators and philosophers and thinkers in jiu jitsu right
02:44:09 but you're also one of the innovators in terms of leg locks and and the 50 50 position and just like
02:44:17 the fact that legs have something to do in jiu jitsu  the the under the other
02:44:24 popularizer innovator in the space is john donahue and his whole group of guys do you have
02:44:28 thoughts about their whole system of leg locks and their ideas about jiu-jitsu and so on sure i i
02:44:35 guess  you know obviously you know john and and the students at henzo have been able to
02:44:40 do fantastic things competitively in the past number of years and you know you mentioned innovators in the in that
02:44:46 kind of you know section of jiu jitsu i would be  i'd love to bring up some
02:44:53 guys like dean lister of course  mazukaze minari in fact a lot of what was going on
02:44:58 in like 90s japan like combat submission wrestling there was some crazy gnarly stuff that
02:45:02 it's just it's on grainy vhs tape but like stuff that if people were doing now they go oh my god that's brand new
02:45:08 like there's it's it's been i think these are things that have been around for a while
02:45:12 in various places i first learned the 50 50 position just like the leg entanglement of it
02:45:17 from brandon vera actually at a seminar at lord urban's martial arts i think in 2005. he learned it from dean lister who used
02:45:23 it to submit alexandria cocareco a really really tough nogi guy at adcc
02:45:29 on the in the run that  dean made to the to the gold medal in the absolute division which was a great performance
02:45:34 at the time first american to do that and  you know and i actually saw a video i mean first of boss rutin
02:45:41 actually broke i think guy mesger's foot with a 50 50 heel hook did he actually grabbed his heel
02:45:47 and his and his toes and like and in pancreas it's back when they had like the man panties and the high 
02:45:52 yeah and  dude that was gnarly boss rooting is underappreciated as like as like he double oh grab like oh yeah
02:45:58 like you know his leverage is leveraged it's that's like a toehold that's you know that goes the other way and
02:46:02 it's like it either doesn't work or breaks in half and  well he's  people don't often think of
02:46:08 boss rooting as an innovator but he is in a way like he  you know talk about like elon musk
02:46:15 and first principles thinking in terms of physics he like just feels like he just gets the
02:46:21 job he figures out like the simplest way to get the job done of breaking things and establishing control and hurting people
02:46:27 remember that was back in the day if you listen to boss root and do any like commentary for any of the  the big mma
02:46:32 shows or any mma show way back when any time guys were clinching like the gosh role for an ebar he was saying that way
02:46:36 back when and now people are doing it all the time with varying degrees of success it's it's funny it's like it's
02:46:41 also tough to be  i think like a breakaway thinker i mean you know groupthink is a real thing
02:46:46 in group inertia and it's it's neat to see you know particularly at a time when maybe that type of stuff
02:46:53 was less accepted you know someone going hey i'm gonna i'm gonna run off in this other
02:46:58 direction i think you know whoever you know the inventor of electricity in my mind is a lot more impressive than
02:47:04 whomever not to say that the person down the line isn't impressive that comes up with an interesting way to use it
02:47:10 both are cool but when you think about just can you imagine we're sitting here like yeah people i'm going to build an
02:47:14 airplane you're like what are you talking about it's crazy people don't fly i'm like no i'm going to do it and
02:47:19 of course it's not going to be as good as the airplane down the line the iterative things that happen later on
02:47:25 but just being able to go to dream something into existence that you haven't seen before and then
02:47:29 make it happen like takes an unbelievable like strength of character almost like a force of will
02:47:35 because you have you're you're blazing a trail that hasn't been walked before that's the bj pen factor
02:47:40 in you know winning the jiu jitsu world championship first non-brazilian to do that was back
02:47:44 in 2001 and then raphael lovato later on it's like he's you know both of those guys
02:47:50 are so unbelievably impressive in my mind for the same reason you know because they were
02:47:55 out there winning at a time when that wasn't a common thing not that it's easy to win now it's just
02:48:00 there's not a psychological hurdle that needs to be left i remember you know when i was early in jiu jitsu like
02:48:04 americans weren't winning the world championships at any belt i mean bj we all knew bj penn because bj penned
02:48:09 it but it was really really uncommon now it happens you know on a semi-regular basis of
02:48:14 course the brazilians are so strong europeans are still strong but  and australians are coming on as
02:48:18 well but  it's it's definitely kind of an interesting thing so to come back to
02:48:23 you know john danaher and the  hensar team obviously they're doing fantastic things john's had some really
02:48:28 really great innovation there and the the the systematization and the methodology that they're using is  is great and
02:48:35 it's neat to see that it's getting out there i would just also what i would encourage people to
02:48:41 make sure that they're you know catching up on their history because obviously you know john's a brilliant instructor and
02:48:45 has done things you know for the sport that that are fantastic that haven't been done before but you know none of us
02:48:50 exist in a vacuum and i've learned things from everywhere else so you know john would say the same i'm sure
02:48:55 and  you know dean lister would say the same and it's just neat when you can kind of trace the history of all of this
02:49:00 happening because we've had humanity's had two arms and two legs for some time at least as long as i've been
02:49:05 alive but you mentioned like airplanes do you think there's something totally new to be invented in jiu jitsu
02:49:12 still not totally new but like the you know flying isn't new right  but airplanes nevertheless made that much
02:49:20 more efficient is there like new ideas to be discovered in digital still i'd say the reason i'd say yes is the same
02:49:26 reason i would say i believe in alchemy even though i don't i'm serious like i've got some backing for this okay
02:49:32 you know i guess i talk about this with a buddy of mine a lot like  and facilitative versus not facilitated beliefs
02:49:40 and if i don't believe something is possible and i do no investigation towards it
02:49:45 i'll never find something even if it's there it's almost like it's no different than me walking up on a group of people
02:49:50 and going like oh man look at these jerks this is going to suck versus me going i wonder what these guys
02:49:54 are up to i'm about to have two very different conversations even though the players in the game are no different my
02:49:59 internal constitution has changed because of of how i've decided to approach the situation so although i wouldn't
02:50:05 personally want to spend all my time trying to turn lead into gold because i don't believe that it's likely to work
02:50:11 only a person who's willing to spend his or her life in that pursuit will actually get to the bottom of that and
02:50:15 also in the in the pursuit of that they're likely to find other things so i think a lot of
02:50:20 times the idea is that humanity is pushed forward by you know again it's another orson scott
02:50:24 carbon it's like you know human beings are in this slog it's paraphrasing just in this slog over time
02:50:29 and then periodically the humanity gives birth to genius like someone that invents the wheel invents
02:50:34 electricity pushes us forward you know comes up with with the idea of governance that doesn't you know just
02:50:40 start and end with the point of a sword you know and  you know these aren't common things these are unbelievable
02:50:46 advancements that you know that just me sitting here i didn't come up with them but i just get the benefit of it
02:50:50 so i guess what i would say is a lot of times these ideas are called crazy you know like as we discussed on kind of
02:50:55 offline it's like you know einstein was brilliant in his 20s and it was brilliant before that i would suspect
02:51:01 but basically  you know gets recognized later on in life and of course we all thought those were
02:51:06 great ideas the man was probably roundly mocked for giant chunks of his life and i i guess
02:51:10 so it's neat i would say there's definitely in my mind things that even if it's just
02:51:15 combinations and new to me new ways to see things new ways to understand different depth of
02:51:20 understanding possibly new things new positions new ideas because even if that's not true
02:51:27 the process of of going through and acting as if it is and believing like that and focusing and
02:51:32 trying to investigate will make any of us will push us all forward we're sitting there you know obsessing
02:51:38 over the cult of our current knowledge i think is the biggest the biggest danger um
02:51:42 and the biggest cause of stagnation that exists anywhere yeah and it starts with believing the
02:51:48 the impossible which is kind of interesting one of the things that's really inspiring to me is to see people out
02:51:53 there which which sadly are rare who kind of have  a combination of two things one
02:52:04 is they have a world view that involves that includes a lot of ideas that are crazy and
02:52:10 the second part is they're exceptionally focused and competent in bringing that whatever the ideas in that world view to
02:52:16 reality so there's certainly a lot of people with crazy ideas you know there's a lot of
02:52:20 conspiracy theorists they have way out their beliefs about things but they're not
02:52:27 doing much to like make the like build stuff grounded and like they're not engineers or whatever they're just like espousing
02:52:33 different crazy ideas but that's why you get like the elon musk type characters and the reason i bring
02:52:38 him up a lot is because like there's not many others to bring up it's like
02:52:44 there's not many examples of it through history the people i mean the guy's convinced that we're
02:52:49 going to colonize mars and basically everybody on earth thinks that's insane
02:52:57 everyone accept the guy that's going to do it right except that's going to do it and like
02:53:03 you can imagine like a couple hundred years from now people will i mean
02:53:08 first of all they won't certainly won't remember the haters they won't remember all the people if if
02:53:14 they do remember them they'll remember them in a sense like people were silly to think that this
02:53:19 isn't the obvious path forward like from a perspective that's what that's what
02:53:26 elon talks about like it's obvious that we're going to expand throughout the universe like so from his perspective from his
02:53:32 perspective like but to me it is also obvious because like either we destroy ourselves
02:53:41 or will expand beyond earth like  like there's not many you know we well it's not maybe it's not completely
02:53:48 obvious i'm i guess i share that world view there's the other possibility that we humans find a sort of
02:53:55 an inner peace where the forces of capitalism will calm down and we'll all just meditate and do yoga
02:54:01 and jiu jitsu and like relax with this whole tech thing where we keep building new technologies
02:54:06 but it's cool to have those kinds of people that just believe the big ambitious crazy dreams
02:54:12 because that's where it starts if you want to build something special you have to first believe
02:54:16 that when you also have to believe strongly enough that you're not vulnerable and i'm speculating but it's
02:54:21 like i can only imagine how many people have told elon that what he's doing is crazy so
02:54:26 not only did he dream it up he dreamed it up went with it and also went with it in
02:54:30 the face of being told that it's not going to work and then time and then also
02:54:35 stepped away from the bitterness because he's done a series of really crazy impressive things
02:54:39  and that's only those little things i'm aware of but and also staying away from the bitterness of every single time
02:54:45 you did something good initially i all i do is talk down about you and then eventually i act as
02:54:50 of course of course i never apologize and yet you don't let that dampen your spirits for the next innovation
02:54:55 which is pretty incredible to me to watch yeah it's kind of cool i mean  it's contagious to spend time
02:55:03 with the guy because he's not it's rogan has the same look to him which is interesting about these people
02:55:10 is  like there there's like a hater shield that he's like he doesn't even like
02:55:17 sense them it feels like like it doesn't he does he thinks to  to elon it's like it's obvious
02:55:24 i mean he keeps calling it like first principles thinking like physics says it's true therefore
02:55:29 it's true like he's convinced himself that like his beliefs are grounded in the
02:55:34 fundamental fabric of the way the universe works therefore the haters don't matter right
02:55:39 and i mean that's kind of like a system of thought he developed himself through all the difficulty through all
02:55:44 the doubt he's able to take huge risks with basically putting everything he owes on the line multiple times throughout his life
02:55:51 amidst all the drama amidst all the doubts amidst all like the he's still able to make just clear
02:55:58 clear-headed decisions it's i don't know what to make of it but it's inspiring as hell well
02:56:02 it's i think it's something that's funny i think like i can only imagine that you know history will look back on him
02:56:08 as a brilliant person but that's not the only there's there's a lot of maybe not not
02:56:12 statistically speaking but a lot numerically on a giant planet of you know billions people
02:56:16 a lot of brilliant people well you know time place luck fortune all that other stuff but at the
02:56:22 same time that clearly isn't the only determining thing in making elon musk musk and obviously i don't know the guy
02:56:27 from adam and but it's an interesting thing that it's not just his intellect his belief system
02:56:33 his structure how he's viewing the world like that's did he
02:56:38 reason his way to that did he not what other factors came in i'm really curious about that because i guess coming it's
02:56:45 again i feel really strongly about people's belief structure and and this the how they view the world
02:56:51 being more important than the engine behind it you know it makes someone resilient or
02:56:55 not it makes someone positive or not because you could have ten thousand i think about this for
02:56:59 competitive stuff you could have ten thousand things going properly and one thing going improperly
02:57:03 if you focus on the improper you'll probably fix it at a certain point which is good
02:57:07 facilitated for development in the long term but if you had to go and try to perform a task in the next five minutes
02:57:13 and you're focusing on the negative your confidence and your your your belief in in the positive outcome of the future is
02:57:18 likely to be damaged whereas you could have 25 things going wrong but you go man i sure am happy to
02:57:23 be alive how fortunate i am this is great i can't this is i have problems to solve this is awesome
02:57:28 versus i list the problems and i start bitching about them both of them are technically accurate
02:57:32 but it's i guess different lenses and i think that's a really neat thing to see you know someone you know exemplifying
02:57:41 so maybe to look at the the fighting world there's a million questions i can ask here like one you mentioned bj penn
02:57:50 you  first of all you are undefeated in the ufc and one of the fights you've had is against
02:57:55 bj penn which is a kind of an incredible fight you you won performance of the night
02:58:02 what did it feel like to  to face pj pen and to beat him definitively as he did
02:58:09 like what's that whole experience like i'll be honest i didn't know if i was going to ever be able to fight
02:58:15 again after beating gray maynard in 2016 and i've had a couple of periods of those i i was about to join the army
02:58:20 actually in  when i was 30 before the  for the ufc for jen sent me over to ultimate fighter i
02:58:26 didn't want to go because i was like one they're never going to pick me too i'd be terrible for tv
02:58:30 three i'll probably say something i'm gonna get you know burned to death in the streets
02:58:33 you know i'm like this isn't a great idea and then  she said well go out there see what happens do it anyway
02:58:38 you'll be you'll regret it if you didn't and then i ended up doing ultimate fighter and then
02:58:43 so i fought three times on the show and then i fought for the for the finale so those four
02:58:49 times in like five or six months which was great and then it took me a year to get another opponent
02:58:55 and that was gray maynard and then gray was obviously a very tough guy managed to get a good outcome there then
02:59:02 it took two years to fight b.j penn and that was you know obviously i'm training all the
02:59:06 time every single day and that never stops but that was i'll be honest like pretty deeply frustrating because you
02:59:10 know as a human being as an athlete you know i think as an athlete you die twice like
02:59:14 you have an athletic peak or area and then then you go on with the rest of your life
02:59:19 but it is a microcosm for the rest of your life it's like you're seeing this the sand tick away in the hourglass or
02:59:25 drop away and you're going man this is these are years between 31 32 33 like i'll be at my best at this time my absolute
02:59:31 best physically now not technically i'm a lot better now than i was before and i planned but
02:59:35 at a certain point you will unless you're bernard hopkins you will reach diminishing returns and
02:59:40 i guess that's the long the long wait you can feel the clock ticking is this frustrating so why why
02:59:46 did it take two years for bj i  i i that's the question people ask a lot like
02:59:52 why does nobody want to fight right now i don't know i probably they probably think they'll get infected by whatever
02:59:56 this is but  i don't i don't blame them but  i mean you're a really tough opponent is the bottom line
03:00:02 i'll say that i'm different maybe they perceive that the  the the threat is greater than the reward i'm
03:00:07 hoping that now that we're ranked number 12 you know in the ufc rankings that  that that will change and i know that if we're
03:00:14 one more win and then we're in the top 10 that you know now now you're there but  what i've
03:00:20 consistently found is that like randoms want to fight and i'm like go away you know i didn't come here for you you
03:00:24 know because if i wanted to just fight anybody i could go down to a waffle house and yell until like dmx shows up
03:00:29 and we can we can fight because he'll be at the waffle house too who am i kidding i really want to hang out with the mx
03:00:33 but  you know it's like you want to when i had the opportunity dmx oh my god that was i would
03:00:39 never flick shows i would never fight dmx we'd be on the same team no but  anyway it's i i guess um
03:00:47 i i accepted fights against  i asked the guy to ask about llamas i said yes i got asked about dennis bermudez i said
03:00:51 yes you know like long periods of time and they at that time you know in between 2016
03:01:00 and 2018 i was struggling to have have opponents who would sign up and  us i haven't turned down fights i just
03:01:05 said hey you know keep the i don't care about fighting the randoms and
03:01:10 it's you have a successful school you're like you're running you're a martial artist broadly speaking so
03:01:18 it doesn't make sense to to take fights that aren't like right that fit a certain kind of
03:01:22 trajectory for your career and that's when when bj penn they said well bj's looking for an opponent i was like
03:01:28 i'm your guy and  and i think that you know bj accepted that fight because another jiu-jitsu guy i don't think
03:01:34 he perceived that i was much of a threat on the feet and  you know i was able to
03:01:41 it was neat to get it to compete against someone  you know who's one of my heroes one of the people i looked up to in mma for
03:01:46 the longest time and you intimidated by that no no i love competing i i don't really get nervous or scared before fights i'm
03:01:53 not afraid to get hurt and not afraid to win i'm not afraid to lose it's i i'm just excited for the i feel
03:01:58 thankful for the opportunity to compete and the opportunity to to play when it matters you know i i
03:02:04 just but that's the only time i'm interested in playing anymore is when it when it matters when the opposition
03:02:09 is i know that you know it's funny because people pick on on a lot of some opponents particularly
03:02:14 after after the fact like if you if you get a good outcome well then  of course lex beat that guy that guy wasn't
03:02:18 that good i'm like well i was that's after the fact i get to say that and also as the person in the ring you
03:02:23 know bj penn has hurt a lot of people in in in mixed martial arts cage
03:02:28 and i could actually absolutely have been on that list so it was neat to get to compete
03:02:33 against someone that i really respect someone that i looked up to for a long time someone who has a great skill set and
03:02:39 also i went up and wait to fight him at his weight class he didn't have to come down to mine which is where he'd take
03:02:43 lightly it was lightweight yeah i generally have featherweight i walk around like 158 pounds so
03:02:48 what's the lightweight and featherweight  lightweight is 155. with a day before weigh-in and
03:02:53 featherweight is 145 with the day before weigh-in so i'm a little bit more properly sized for featherweight but um
03:02:59 anyway  you know i so i didn't feel like obviously he was giving up
03:03:04 a couple years of age but i was giving up size and all this other stuff and it was you know i was just excited
03:03:09 to have the opportunity to step in against someone like bj and  you know we managed to to get out
03:03:14 of there with a with a good outcome without getting too banged up but  just it was cool because we tied
03:03:20 up on the fence and just even  the second you know is when you're rolling with somebody and you touch and
03:03:24 you can feel what they're doing you go oh man this guy's really good you can feel the calm you can feel the small
03:03:29 minor adjustments that they're making the subtle things that they're doing and that was one of those things that
03:03:34 was really neat and gratifying because you know you never know sometimes people that you've heard of are a little bit
03:03:38 less technically proficient than you thought and other times you'll meet some guys training like who the hell is this guy
03:03:43 how have i not heard of this person and  bj was exactly as a jitsu guy what i would have thought
03:03:49 and  another thing that's another thing that bugged me about how people reacted after the fight
03:03:54 is  you know basically going oh bj screwed up this screwed up that i'm like all right yeah it's so interesting
03:04:00 that's sad that was you know one of the  to me i mean as a fan of both that was a
03:04:07 beautiful moment as  as a as a kind of passing of a torch in a sense
03:04:13 of exceptional performance like another one that stands out to me maybe you can comment is
03:04:21 i don't understand well maybe i do why conor mcgregor gets as much hate as he does  he probably revels in it but
03:04:30 i think he doesn't get enough credit for  jose aldo for the for like for base
03:04:40 you know knocking him out in the the in the in the first few  seconds of  of a fight
03:04:46 i mean  jose is like one of the greatest fighters ever that's true  maybe some people could
03:04:51 be even put in the top ten no question and the like i don't understand why it's doesn't get as much
03:05:01 like conor mcgregor doesn't get as much credit  as i think he deserves for that and for eddie alvarez and all
03:05:07 the fights for some reason whenever  conor mcgregor beat somebody
03:05:15 well that they they were not that good then like it means like they were they were there something was off right
03:05:21 that's convenient isn't it yeah it's it's it's quite strange to me but i mean what are your thoughts on the
03:05:29 on conor mcgregor maybe one way to ask that i'm russian some obviously also khabib fan
03:05:34 but i'm also a conor fan it seems like there's not many of us who are like fans of both right
03:05:43 the two of us which also is a good play   stop dude yeah really really tough dude just like five line which is really
03:05:50 interesting also the oh wow i didn't know that side of it there's a brain there well on the khabib
03:05:56 versus conor what do you make of their first fight what do you do you agree with me that 
03:06:00 they should fight again because i think it would be awesome if they fought again in
03:06:07 moscow and  do you agree with me i'm just gonna put say things that piss people off but i
03:06:12 believe is that conor actually has a chance to beat khabib one the conor absolutely has a chance to be
03:06:17 conor has a chance to beat anyone that he steps into that ring with and not just like a mathematical chance you were
03:06:21 like oh one of the billion but like you know like he absolutely it's funny because i i won't pretend to know conor really
03:06:27 well but i first met conor in 2010 when i was teaching a seminar in  at straight blast jim ireland in
03:06:31 dublin and that's actually where i first met all of the coaches that ended up being on
03:06:38 conor's team you know john kavanagh owen roddy  gunnar nelson you know so for i actually
03:06:43 i enjoyed being on ultimate fighter and being on a uriah favors team and getting to train with all the guys there but at
03:06:48 the same time that the people that i was actually i knew better were actually the european side all the connors coaches
03:06:56 and  that was a neat thing because i got to i met connor i didn't know who connor
03:06:59 like connor wasn't conor at that point yeah that was before his ufc oh yeah well well before yeah i
03:07:05 think i think he got in like 2014 maybe something like that yeah and  anyway but he was doing well
03:07:09 in cage warriors winning the titles there i think prior to that you know i remember going seeing him on
03:07:14 the show and  also then getting to see him train because i competed 
03:07:19 i was initially slated to fight david tamer for the ultimate fighter finale for getting put into fight artem
03:07:24 for the title for the show so i went over to ireland to train for a couple days and basically it was neat to watch him
03:07:30 watch him work i mean man is focused and trains a lot it's very very smart
03:07:35 and very very hard working and i think a lot of times people get stuck in the  in this you know and they
03:07:42 almost want to believe that this was lucky or this this person you know they're not working that hard
03:07:47 they're just out there they got there with their mouth and that's that's just not the case and
03:07:52 you know i don't know what it's like you know obviously connor's very well off right now and i don't know how hard
03:07:56 how serious he's training what he's doing i can't speak to any of that but  there's no question that that he
03:08:01 has skills to be dangerous and one of the funny things obviously the khabib fight one could be his weight could he
03:08:05 was a great fighter and also has the chance to beat anyone in that ring at any given time
03:08:11 but  there's there wasn't conor you know it's  one that he can he can put anybody away and as you
03:08:18 mentioned i think that he doesn't get the credit for the eddie alvarez fight he doesn't get the credit for the jose
03:08:21 aldo fight because it was almost so much of a letdown i remember that happened the same weekend that i did the ultimate
03:08:25 fighter finale and you're like all right wait what yeah it almost doesn't feel like a fight
03:08:31 happened but we mentioned miyamoto musashi i mean musashi was famous for the way he poked and prodded at people
03:08:37 with what he was doing whether overtly or not it's like oh we're supposed to fight to the death and
03:08:45 4pm rolls around i'm just not there five i mean you remember all the all the antics and nonsense that conor was
03:08:49 pulling prior to that like speaking personally that's not it's not something i would feel comfortable doing
03:08:54 but it's like everyone's different and the effect that it had on on jose was i mean beyond evidence when was the
03:08:58 last time jose started the start of the fight with leaping left hand leaping right-hander like
03:09:05 wait what and then he was obviously you know living rent-free in jose's head at that point and
03:09:11 that was a combination of psychological you know ability and and and wherewithal and then physical and
03:09:16 remind me of the way muhammad ali would would bother people and whatnot and the fact that he's a polarizing figure
03:09:23 i i think makes some people not give him his due and then at the same time sometimes certain fans may be
03:09:29 go overboard but  they remember the knee that ben asker and got knocked out with by
03:09:33 mazdal i mean that was an amazing unbelievable thing but three inches to the right three inches to the left i
03:09:38 guess whichever side his head wasn't could have been square but  and that fight starts with ben askren on
03:09:45 top of you in the first five seconds well connor ran and threw a knee just like that at khabib and could be
03:09:51 got right around it that could have easily gone the other way can you imagine what would have happened if
03:09:55 after the after coming back from boxing after coming back from from the mayweather fight connor connor
03:10:00 in the first ten seconds it's over and you're like he would yeah it would have been intolerable but basically
03:10:08 yeah like you know but see here's the thing let me actually push back slightly  i mean to the fans correct me if i'm wrong
03:10:18 but conor seems to because i've competed a lot and like there's a tension there's a
03:10:22 negativity sometimes depending on the opponent and there's a respect afterwards that happens like when you understand
03:10:30 that there's a deep like respect and almost like love for each other like i always seen that in conor like
03:10:36 all the trash talk afterwards yes there's a it's it's a subtle thing
03:10:40 you can't always see it but there's a respect like i agree and the like that i almost on the khabib side
03:10:50 i almost feel like khabib really took it personally he did he didn't he lost the respect for connor
03:10:56 i thought the whole time conor had the respect so i what i wanted to say is like if connor won that fight like rock
03:11:03 khabib i could see like i wouldn't see trash talking i could see like trash i can stop
03:11:08 right there i think so too but at the same time i'm sure you recall like connor come across in some pretty
03:11:12 personal territory you know both religiously and also familiar with  with khabib and it's
03:11:18 you know i mean i think it's the sort of thing that i don't know it's an interesting that's one of those
03:11:22 sentences like you have to know the difference so obviously i know the the the kibbe
03:11:29 the dagestani people they don't play around like that they don't play wrong like that you know
03:11:33 you know i mean they take offense to basically i mean you you don't do that so  so like connor didn't
03:11:41 maybe he did on purpose or maybe he wasn't even just aware of of  it was cultural differences about
03:11:47 the box he opened like you can talk to him if floyd mayweather you can you can go anywhere with him you
03:11:54 can you could say the most defensive things but with  yeah that could be hardline
03:12:01 yeah hard lines but you  i mean a lot of people ask i know you're a  face it feels like khabib is one of
03:12:11 the hardest puzzles to solve in in all of mixed martial arts if you were to face khabib
03:12:18 do you think how would you go about solving that puzzle like almost the question is almost from
03:12:23 a jiu jitsu perspective too what do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good at controlling position
03:12:30 especially on top very good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position like let's say so forget maybe
03:12:39 striking on the ground how do you solve that guy like what do you do with your guard if you get taken down or do you
03:12:45 create an entire system of not getting taken down or escaping it's like what what ideas do you have for that well i
03:12:51 guess i would say in my mind fighting is a game of trading energy kind of  you know there's two
03:12:57 there's two things there's damage and there's energy so like when i say energy and being like
03:13:02  tired not tired how much how much gas you've got and then damage counts obviously as
03:13:07 well you could be feeling i could be feeling great and then you get to keep me in the head hard really
03:13:10 hard three times it doesn't matter that i could get up and run a mile i can't get up
03:13:15 so anyway you know i think what khabib does is so well is he makes the fight look like
03:13:20 it could be the mega man fight he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most part
03:13:26 and really sucking the life out of people with how suffocating and oppressive is his
03:13:31 control is his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we've ever seen in the ufc it's fantastic
03:13:38 but that poses a really serious threat for people that need to maintain a certain amount of space
03:13:43 and try to hurt them on the feed because unless they're able to inflict an adequate amount of damage
03:13:48 they're gonna each time let's say for instance let's say him taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some point
03:13:53 if every single time khabib takes you down you get right back up it's not that big a deal
03:13:57 because it's actually more we've all experienced this let's say you and i are rolling he tapped me 15 times in one
03:14:03 round who's more tired probably you are yeah you what my ass so badly that it's like you're the only one working
03:14:10 but so if you're comfortable with the up and down of it like being taken down if you're if you don't if you don't get
03:14:18 hurt badly or tired on the bottom you have a chance but that doesn't involve just cracking him on the feet
03:14:23 before he gets a hold of you that's a lot that's a lot to ask that's a lot to ask that's difficult to do it
03:14:28 seemed actually like conor it seemed like it when he was being kind of taken down or the
03:14:35 the takedown attempts against khabib he seemed to be somewhat relaxed the whole thing i
03:14:39 thought he was doing well actually i think that particularly for the first round i thought he did a
03:14:42 very good job it's just one of those things that i think like  could be being the fights taking place
03:14:48 in khabib's world in large part and i mean set aside that one giant  what is it right hand that that
03:14:54 khabib hit khanna with it by the way conor reacted like an absolute champion he got
03:14:58 crushed by that overhand and then dropped and his eyes went right back on khabib it was immediate
03:15:04 great response so even though that was i think that was a bit of a surprising thing conor reacted really really well
03:15:09 but if you're going to be on bottom with khabib for four rounds that's going to be tough and also conor's a way
03:15:14 better grappler than people like to give him credit for but he's not the type of grappler that
03:15:18 can do that can that can that's too tall of an order but there are grapplers that could do that or at
03:15:23 least would have a much much better shot at  being able to weather that type of a
03:15:27 storm do you see yourself being able to be relaxed through that kind of storm yes well i guess
03:15:37 remember being being being savagely beaten is very relevant the time the timing of that answer was
03:15:43 like okay that's a dumb question no that's ultimately the goal of jiu jitsu is to um
03:15:52 be relaxed to the fire for sure and remember like every ufc fighter i win all hypothetical match
03:15:55 ups yeah that's true since  i'm one to ask ridiculous questions and
03:16:04 we've been talking about sci-fi and all that kind of stuff let me ask the kind of big
03:16:10 question that everybody disagrees about certainly with me is  who are the top five greatest mma fighters of all time
03:16:17 oh man and why is fedor number one okay well first off fedor is number one
03:16:22 oh really i agree right there with you really oh yeah talk about people that just get
03:16:27 completely underappreciated even though he's never been like he's never succeeded in the ufc
03:16:32 it's not his fault it came along after him at the time that at the time that fedor was at his height the ufc was
03:16:37 not where it was at for heavyweight fighting i mean not that there weren't good heavyweights there but fedor
03:16:43 fedor was unbelievable you know i mean you remember i mean minotauro nogueira i was a massive fan
03:16:48 of him i still remember watching  what is it pride 2004 when when noguera fought crow cop and got
03:16:54 blasted with that left kick and dropped with like seconds left in the first round pride was great because at a
03:16:58 10-minute first round in that five-minute second which again materially also alters the
03:17:02 fight big time and you know just the texture of the fight because it's totally it's borderline a different sport
03:17:07 you know than than getting a five a pause and a five but anyway  similar sports like one of
03:17:11 those swimming things where they have nine gold medals for different types of swimming right
03:17:17 but still swimming but anyway  well yeah that they would disagree yeah i don't know
03:17:22 but it's so it's totally true ten ten minutes is different than five i'm sorry i think
03:17:27 don't don't don't drown me swimmers i don't swim very well it's easy easy to downplay it but anyway 
03:17:34 yeah and then no better than  jon jones like the modern era well i mean i guess it's tough to
03:17:39 compete to compare across eras it would be like going and saying like oh man how how would such and such great
03:17:45 grappler from today fare against someone from 1995 i'm like well probably pretty well for them depending upon
03:17:53 who they are what's going on you know there's some people that would their skill sets might transition across eras
03:17:58 but a lot of times not but that's not fair we get they'll be like comparing spartans to
03:18:02 modern day you know like army guys they're like well who's gonna win i'm like well did
03:18:07 modern day army guys get modern day weapons well yeah but who's the toughest ruggedest group
03:18:11 of people at the very least so i guess it's tough to say but at least in my mind the people that i think
03:18:16 about for great fighters their their quality of opposition their level of like lasting like success the
03:18:23 level lasting innovation like the courage that they have to demonstrate because again it's like being a big fish
03:18:28 in a small pond takes no courage doesn't mean that there's nothing there but it just requires something a little
03:18:33 bit different so kazushi sakaraba is one of my guys too  bj penn also i mean bj penn fought
03:18:38 leota machida yeah that's insane you know it's there was a time it was a different sport it
03:18:44 was a different time in the sport where you know they were some guys were bouncing around doing different things
03:18:47 but let's so i guess the gracie family it's i mean they never had an
03:18:53 in like obviously hoist was there but they never and that was a definitely a different
03:18:57 sport weight classes being open things like that but you have to say the hoist is up there oh no question one of the
03:19:01 greatest ever i think so too and again i wouldn't be sitting here talking to you
03:19:07 if it weren't for him so the gracie family as a whole but i mean who's the better i mean i think the hoist would
03:19:13 tell you himself probably that hixon would have handled business back then but they didn't put him in so again he's
03:19:17 the greatest fighter the greatest fighter the greatest fighter that we saw do his business so hoist up there for sure
03:19:23 what about so this is like nobody seems to agree with me on this but like this connects to soccer again and messi
03:19:31 it seems that people value like how long you've been a champion how many like defenses of the championship that you've
03:19:41 had successfully to me i highly value singular moments of genius so like like i i don't like if you look at conor
03:19:48 mcgregor he hasn't i guess held i've been a champion very long very much
03:19:53 he didn't defend either title right he didn't defend any other either of the titles but like if you try
03:20:00 and same with messi if you look at  leonel messi there's just moments of brilliance
03:20:05 unlike any other in history for both conor and messi and people don't seem to give credit it's like well
03:20:10 how many world cups have you won but to me like why is it about this arbitrary world
03:20:15 cup thing or championship thing i think it's easier for people to wrap their head around right it's like the nfl combine
03:20:20 when was i mean yeah numbers it's something well again if i go and if i pick tom brady in the first round
03:20:27 you know and it works out they call me a genius if i pick tom brady in the first round after
03:20:31 his combine and it doesn't work out i get fired and i'm never hired again i have to work
03:20:35 work somewhere else but it's like i'm insulating myself from criticism i think almost if i go by the
03:20:40 numbers well he had more bench presses it's like how how many times have the guys that are
03:20:45 like the super studs in the  in the nfl combine ever been on the greatest players in the nfl history in
03:20:50 nfl history like zero or close to zero and even if even if there's some it's certainly not a one
03:20:55 to one so it's so funny though i think it's just like how many how long how many
03:21:00 days did he hold the title oh your title reign was x times longer that means nothing so if we wanted to
03:21:05 find greatest fighter ever like you said i think individual moments of like you're like that was transcended that
03:21:09 was different that was something else because people can win or lose for any number of
03:21:13 different reasons and that that's an interesting thing again i don't blame argentina not winning the
03:21:18 world cup on messi you know that's not fair you know how many times has
03:21:23 you know i mean aggies the i remember when  trent ilford was the quarterback for the 
03:21:28 the baltimore ravens and they had such a strong defense i'm not trying to pick on trent tilford but it's like
03:21:32 they had such a strong defense that that they were like that was the ray lewis you know
03:21:38 chris mcallister era you know and they they won they won the super bowl i don't think anyone is going to say that
03:21:44 you know trent dilfer is a better quarterback than you know or put him in the same category as dan marino
03:21:51 but he got the w he's got the he's got the super ring how many times  let's use march madness
03:21:54 or super bowl i love it like that that guy always makes the finals but he just never gets it done
03:21:58 yeah so let me get this straight get into the finals nine times doesn't count because you didn't win
03:22:03 the end game i'm not saying it wouldn't be better but that guy won the game once he got over the hump well how many other
03:22:07 times was in the finals zero you're like all right yeah it's interesting well we
03:22:12 yeah that we were obsessed with these numbers like because we can't assess their method
03:22:17 right well i think most of the time most of us can't assess the method of anything and it's like oh look at that
03:22:21 guy do x y swimming i'm like how do i know michael phelps is great i don't know
03:22:25 who's faster i can't look at his technique and say anything other than well that's way
03:22:29 better than anything i know how to do but i can't say the difference between him and the next
03:22:33 guy so i guess that's i wonder if it's like i need a concrete identifier and a lot of times people
03:22:38 don't like saying i don't know and most people won't put like a ronda rousey in the top even
03:22:44 20 or 50 of but like she changed more than more than almost anybody else she changed
03:22:51 the martial arts history i i don't know if that even i i don't think i'm over exaggerating that she
03:22:59 she made it okay for women to be fighters yeah and that and like change the way we see like
03:23:07 she's one of the great feminists of our time in her own way yeah in in a weird kind of way that like i don't know
03:23:15  maybe i'm just a ronda rousey fan but the yeah but she's not in the conversation because then you start converting into
03:23:21 numbers well how many did well was she is she among the greatest fighters or did she do the greatest
03:23:25 things you know i mean i don't i think it's something i mean obviously ronda is a great judoka who was
03:23:31 competing in mma at a time when a lot of the girls like where did you get your skills in the
03:23:35 olympics where'd you get yours high school you're like yeah you're gonna olympic girl is gonna beat you up but 
03:23:39 i i guess that that doesn't diminish it just that accomplishment is what it is i don't
03:23:43 have to i don't fedor is not diminished by the fact that
03:23:48 he would like if he were to fight stephen milochus right now probably wouldn't go great
03:23:52 or that jon jones exists i don't now have to like knock fedor's accomplishments down
03:23:57 or say oh because bj penn or someone so let's say he has a mixed record at this point that
03:24:01 somehow invalidates the things that they've done before yeah i guess it kind of brings us back
03:24:05 to a lot of the other people we've talked about the fact that the the brilliant people throughout history
03:24:08 that we love are some of the monsters throughout history that we rightly reviled in a lot of cases we're
03:24:14 complicated people and their legacy is more than just one thing and someone doing something amazing doesn't involve
03:24:18 doesn't mean they didn't do anything bad and someone doing terrible things doesn't doesn't mean that it doesn't
03:24:24 invalidate the the positives that they did but i guess we fighting the urge to put people in one category
03:24:29 and same with ourselves i think that's why people get depressed oh i'm good right now oh i'm bad right now versus
03:24:35 hey we're all at work in progress and we're trying to do x number of things and legacy is a tough thing to figure out
03:24:42 anyway and it's all speculative last time or no on reddit you said that last time too
03:24:49 that you don't experience much fear  before fights i'd like to ask you a couple mike tyson things if it's okay it's just
03:24:54 interesting to me i'm just weird so there's a i don't know if you've seen this clip
03:25:01 of tyson talking about how he feels leading up to a fight that  he's kind of overtaken with fear as he gets closer
03:25:10 and closer and closer to the ring his  confidence grows have you seen the clip i'm aware of it
03:25:17 okay we've seen in a while here let me play it for you i think george st peter said something similar to me one time
03:25:24 while i'm in the dressing room five minutes before i come out my gloves are laced up i'm breaking my
03:25:29 gloves down i'm pushing the lever at the back of my break in the middle of the blood so my knuckle
03:25:34 appears to the left feel my knuckle piercing against the tight leather gloves on that
03:25:39 and the last box angle and i come out i have supreme confidence but i'm scared to death
03:25:43 i'm totally afraid i'm afraid of everything i'm afraid of i'm afraid of being humiliated but i'm
03:25:49 totally confident closer i get to the ring the more confidence i get the closer more confidence i get the
03:25:54 closer more confidence i get all during my training i've been afraid of this man i thought this man might be
03:25:59 capable of beating me i've dreamed of him beating me but i always stayed afraid of him but it was
03:26:06 closer i get to remain more confident once i'm in the ring i'm a god no one could beat
03:26:10 me i'm a god i mean first of all he's cognizant of both his demons and whatever the hell
03:26:17 ideas he has about violence is so interesting is there something about the  the tension that he's describing
03:26:25 about being confident and scared that resonates with you or you're or do you hold to this idea
03:26:30 that you've kind of spoken about before that you're really not afraid no i
03:26:36 i can i can appreciate what he's saying you know i think that you know i can speak to feeling like
03:26:41 concerned about let's say for instance if you feel a certain way i think people are a lot more like computers than we
03:26:48 than we like to admit and just because a lot of times i can't parse what's going on and why it doesn't mean
03:26:53 that it's not it doesn't make sense and and i think that at least in the times of like if
03:26:59 i'm concerned about a situation or about a person or about something happening prior to
03:27:05 the fight or i'm like there's a reason there was a reason i don't have to push that down and bury it there's a reason
03:27:09 like why what have i not thought about what have i not done what am i missing why am i feeling this
03:27:13 way as you mentioned you know for yourself prior like you'd be like why am i feeling like this i
03:27:18 don't do this very well in certain aspects of my life now that i mentioned it or not i think
03:27:22 about it but when it comes to competing i think i do an all right job and i'm trying to learn to be better and
03:27:26 it's  and going like well why do i if i feel this way there's a reason
03:27:31 okay am i thinking about this the wrong way have i not adequately prepared for something i have to i
03:27:36 have to address it and then maybe i'll be up for four hours that night you know like extra hours thinking what if i not
03:27:41 address watching sparring watching this watching that and then that when i when i
03:27:47 am thinking about things more more accurately or when i've addressed what that concern was
03:27:52 i feel any of that concern kind of dissipate and i guess if i honestly thought that
03:27:58 you know i guess when it comes to i know i'm gonna die at a certain point obviously i'm gonna get hurt
03:28:04 i mean you know pain happens but the pain of loss would be nothing compared to the or
03:28:08 the pain of injury nothing compared to the pain of running away you know and yeah and
03:28:15 so i guess if i think about where's my value what it's like i feel like i'm a winner every single
03:28:20 time i step into that ring and fight with everything that i have i can't promise that i'll win
03:28:24 my next fight i know that i have the skills and the tools to beat anyone in grappling or wearing mixed martial
03:28:29 arts at this point it's just i i know that for certain i've trained enough people i compete with enough
03:28:34 people i know i know where i stand but i also know that i'm not perfect and also the
03:28:39 the better fighter even if i perceive that i was that thing doesn't win on the night the the man
03:28:45 who fights better wins on the night and if i give credence in my mind to
03:28:51 only the person that's that's one has value versus going what's your process what's your path through this how are
03:28:57 you going about this how are you thinking about this how are you behaving then if if i can focus on the process
03:29:03 then then i will respect my opponent i will respect myself and i'll respect anyone
03:29:10 that behaves with with a certain level of of consistency to that and they could win there's plenty of
03:29:15 winners in history that that are  bags and there's plenty of losers that are not but
03:29:20 winning doesn't make you a bad or good person and losing doesn't make you good by default either
03:29:25 or bad by default so and i think that that can be the truth socially that can be the truth you know athletically and
03:29:31 you know academically so i guess is there a primal fear though like a primal fear of getting hurt the
03:29:42 running away and not facing the the threat long term is the bigger pain than any pain you can experience in the fight
03:29:51 that's pretty powerful but what about the violence of i mean you don't have that on your face but like
03:29:56 the i don't know if you've also seen tyson talk about he was on rogan recently he was talking about
03:30:04 was trying to psychoanalyze himself about why he enjoys violence so much i mean he called it orgasmic
03:30:13 i don't know have you seen that clip i haven't okay we're playing we're playing it because i can i need to
03:30:19 because trump also retweeted it which is hilarious i don't know how to contextualize yeah that's something that
03:30:23 our president retweeted the clip of  of tyson saying that's just maybe he's
03:30:30 just doing like they're not it's like i'm gonna throw him a curveball no one's gonna have any idea
03:30:34 what that is but yeah he did no explanation just here you go there you go well i think that's kind of like what
03:30:40 you're describing it's like if i give you an answer it has to be a good one better to just let your imagination run exactly
03:30:46 yeah he's yeah he's like the kubrick of our time you know what's really interesting that
03:30:57 period it's not real but sometimes i struggle with the fact of why it's a possibility i can really hurt somebody
03:31:07 what do you mean when you struggle struggle with the possibility that you could hurt them
03:31:14 that is sometimes it's orgasmic sometimes yeah like some fights like particularly like tyro biggs or someone that you had
03:31:23 problems with someone that you joe's not getting you had animosity towards
03:31:28 so when you finally get your hands on what does it mean when fighting gets gets you erect what does that mean it's
03:31:39 a good question means you're getting excited yeah so that that's going through your mind
03:31:46 right now well that's how i get when i was a kid and i you know sometimes i get to twinkle the twinkle yeah well
03:31:53 that's what i'm saying is like you reached a state as a human being as a champion as a ferocious fighter
03:32:01 you reached a state of of ability and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever ever
03:32:07 touch and feel that's why i'm asking you when you're running when you're hitting the bag when that
03:32:11 heart's beating again and that you know who you are you're mike tyson so when
03:32:16 you're doing all this again you're still mike tyson those thoughts have got to be burning
03:32:20 inside you again it's got to be pretty wild i don't know it's it's wild but um
03:32:30 i believe it's it's rightfully so to be that way and i just know how to i don't but think i i'm how to deal
03:32:36 with it i don't let it overwhelm me i mean he goes on to try to
03:32:43 they don't ever like joe doesn't bite well the interesting thing about that conversation is mike was trying to
03:32:51 figure himself out yeah like he's trying on the spot like to me it was like to me it's so real
03:33:06 and honest to  to feel like pleasure from hurting somebody like that you rarely hear that
03:33:17 in this society it's like you rarely like talk about like you feel pleasure from winning
03:33:26 you feel pleasure from like the relief of overcoming like all the stress you have to go through
03:33:33 pleasure from just like the the specifics of the fight the techniques you use the
03:33:38 maybe overcoming being down a couple rounds but like how often do you hear somebody say
03:33:45 i just enjoyed he's not even saying because i hate the opponent he's saying like i enjoyed purely the violence of it
03:33:53 that's crazy i mean i don't know it's honest it made me ask like i wonder how many of us are cognizant of that
03:34:03 let's say mike is uncommonly seemingly  honest i think athletes make a full-time job out of lying
03:34:10 you know i think people make a full themselves perhaps too that's fair i mean in some you tell yourself or you
03:34:16 tell others what you feel you need to or maybe whether you would even know what you feel you need
03:34:21 to but why should he not i mean again did he did he run up and just hit somebody that's
03:34:27 didn't sign up for this no they sign it to be there well that's the interesting thing about
03:34:33 dyson is there's that weird  like non-standard behavior i mean like your fighting style is not standard
03:34:42 he's non-standard to another degree of like  who else has that in jiu jitsu 
03:34:50  polaris   has this kind of weirdness like what's what's in there like there's a fear that i think 
03:35:00 most opponents would have because it's like it's no longer about like it takes you out of the realm of
03:35:06 its game it takes us back to the thing we're talking about like before is
03:35:12 it strips away that like several layers of ryan hall the the podcast  guest ryan hall the jiu jitsu instructor ryan
03:35:19 hall just a competitor it keeps going down to a point where like ryan hall the murderer of all
03:35:25 things that get in his way that lies underneath all of it seemingly like if we're
03:35:31 like in this society we put all that aside but it makes you wonder like now society's being tested in many
03:35:37 ways it makes you wonder like what's underneath there well do we want do we want the answer to that because i
03:35:42 guess it's what is it  you've seen paul fiction you know the best character in the movie and in the
03:35:47 best scene in the movies i give my questions here if you're what he called him my answers scare you she's asking
03:35:52 scary questions you know and i guess  you wonder i mean all of us that's something that i
03:35:57 think it's funny oh that's not okay i mean versus maybe not appropriate
03:36:04 for situation x y or z but  what should make any of us think i mean humanity is a different place now and i
03:36:08 mean i'm not saying anything crazy out there but it came in a different place now than we were 5 000
03:36:12 years ago where all of us are descended from people who have killed things with their
03:36:19 teeth and fingernails in order to be where we are and whether it was in whether it was an
03:36:23 animal or it was in conflict with another person i mean think about that the chances of
03:36:27 dying by violence now are so so slim at least in in most countries in most places like shockingly small
03:36:33 thankfully but there was a period of time like the most period of time where dying by violence
03:36:38 was mostly how it went down and i guess what would be facilitative what would allow you to win
03:36:45 back to ender's game you know what allows you if you can't do that you are all you are
03:36:51 forever subject to people who can and that's that's a real thing and you know we're fortunate to find
03:36:57 ourselves in a situation where we don't where other things matter but that is a funny thing periodically where people
03:37:01 you'll see people like kind of drawing at each other like in videos or out in the world
03:37:06 that clearly neither of them expect this to get serious like i'm just going to yell at you you're going to yell at me
03:37:10 and it's like this weird larping thing we're both going to go on our own separate way
03:37:13 all it takes is one person to be like well i wasn't kidding yeah and it's like oh you'll go to jail like oh
03:37:20 i know you're gonna go to the morgue and it's that's but that can happen like that like society i mean obviously anyway you
03:37:25 could jump across the table and stab me in the eye i mean i appreciate hope if you don't
03:37:29 and there will be consequences if you do but not from not from me from from the rest of society will
03:37:35 potentially get you at a certain point but you can decide to not play by the rules anytime you want
03:37:40 it's fascinating that yeah that's we've created rules based on which we all behave but
03:37:45 underneath there you know there there's things that doesn't the there's motivations and
03:37:51 forces that don't play by the rules they're still there nature's metal is under the surface
03:37:56 seriously and again i pull out my phone and i'm basically saying like hey i'm gonna you're gonna get caught yeah
03:38:02 but really i'm further antagonizing you yeah rightly wrongly you know what i mean like and that that's an interesting
03:38:07 thing and i feel like just people need to remember any of us need to remember just for any reason just
03:38:13 that's that's one step away at all at all times you ever i've had people say to me before like oh i don't feel safe
03:38:18 i'm like you're not safe i'll kill you before you get out of this room nothing you do stop that nothing
03:38:23 i mean but don't worry you could do the same to me which means i'm like oh thank goodness can you imagine like how many
03:38:29 guns are there are in this country like i mean everywhere i mean seriously everywhere but that's a heartening
03:38:34 thought not the other way because people usually freak out and go oh my god gun violence gun violence says gun violence is
03:38:38 like really not a serious issue in the united states compared to what it could be because it means that i mean with the
03:38:45 amount of guns and the amount of bullets that are out there that are in circulation can you imagine if like
03:38:51 one in every thousand was used in anger each day i mean this would be a terrifying place to live
03:38:56 you couldn't go anywhere so i mean although you could say hey this is more than we'd like or xyz
03:39:00 it actually means that people are much more reasonable insane than we're saying than or then i then sometimes i might
03:39:06 and i might argue so i guess what i mean is like oh man i walked to 7-11 and i didn't get stabbed i'm like oh
03:39:11 well that's good because not because i protected myself with my karate it's basically no one decided to run
03:39:16 over and stab me because i wasn't protecting myself it's i they they stopped so i guess we're all
03:39:22 fortunate to live in a society that like you said nature being metal doesn't become that big of an issue all the time
03:39:27 but it is funny when you get people in the ring and you go hey let's peel back from mr tyson many layers of that
03:39:35 and say hey now it's okay and it's cool that i mean that's what society's doing so i've
03:39:40 i lived in harvard square for a while and we add extra layers of what safe means like
03:39:47 now there's a dis discourse about safe spaces about like ideas being violence or or like 
03:39:55 you know yeah but ideas or minor slights against your personality being violence
03:40:02 but that's all like extra layers around the nature is metal thing that  it's cool that's that's what
03:40:08 progress is but we can't forget that like underneath it it's still it's still the the thing that will
03:40:15 murder at the at the drop of  in any at any moment if  if aroused one thing that i find funny though or
03:40:23 ironic maybe about the  the you know words of violence you know offense is violence thing is that of course
03:40:29 that if that the belief in that then justifies my violence like my and whether maybe maybe not physical violence but my
03:40:38 response to my my aggressive response to things and i guess like which again regrets begets a further aggressive response and
03:40:44 like a you know kind of a tit-for-tat sort of situation or or it goes to like well there's 10 of me and
03:40:49 there's one of you so we'll get you and you can't do anything about it but that's not morality that's that's
03:40:55 just saying that's might makes right so i guess again you can understand why people do it and there are certain there
03:41:01 is a progress aspect to it but again i guess without proper examination i'm effectively with my 10 friends you know and and the
03:41:08 force of the law mike tysoning people but not admitting to myself what i'm doing and at least mike tyson again is honest
03:41:17 are you  afraid of death i mean it's easy for me to say no as i sit here probably not about to die but
03:41:22 is this like the ufc question can you defeat any opponent exactly yes the answer is of course yes and  i
03:41:28 don't have they're not around they're not here are they yeah exactly but i mean you  do you
03:41:33 ponder your own mortality maybe another context to that is you mentioned two deaths
03:41:39 for martial artists i think that's actually why honestly even though at a relatively
03:41:43 young age i think mortality is something that i'm aware of more maybe more than the average person
03:41:47 i think probably most athletes can speak to this and anyone that's had trouble i've managed
03:41:52 to to slide out of a couple near-death experiences personally you know mostly river related
03:41:59 because i'm an idiot but i regret nothing but  yeah yeah but  thank god we're here but um
03:42:04 yeah it is in our seeing seeing the end and seeing going well what's going to happen i guess i think
03:42:13 it comes back to kind of what we're discussing about belief structure and belief system
03:42:18 i think a lot of times if i recognize that no matter what i do it's all going to end one day and then
03:42:23 you go well why were we here what would i do am i going to make it to 40. i have no
03:42:28 idea i'd like to hope so that i had no idea that i was going to make it to to the age that i am now
03:42:33 am i going to make it to 80. how much of that is in my control much of it is not i mean it's so funny
03:42:39 it's an interesting like back to the belief structure again like locus of internal and external locus of control
03:42:46 you know what's facilitative versus what's true and you know i think accepting personal
03:42:50 responsibility for more than is on my control is is probably a positive but at the same time recognizing
03:42:57 that much of much is not in my control i was fortunate enough to be born in the united states fortunate
03:43:03 enough to you know to not knock on wood have a serious disease that i'm not aware of right now
03:43:09 i didn't do any of that i just showed up that was really fortunate and i i guess that doesn't diminish
03:43:15 the fact that i try to make decent choices but it works in concert with it and i i guess um
03:43:23 when i when you go is death what i want right now no no i should think not and again it's easy for me to be relatively
03:43:29 calm about as i'm not staring it in the face but what i would care a lot more about is is how you live that's what's in my
03:43:38 control and i can't control if as i walk out of this building a helicopter falls on me
03:43:42 worrying about that i can't control maybe i maybe i have cancer now and i don't know it
03:43:47 i really hope not but there's something about meditating on the fact that it could end today outside your control
03:43:55 that can  clarify your thinking about yeah the the fact that life is amazing like just kind of
03:44:00 somebody yeah helping you enjoy this moment even if life was horrible let's say for instance it was it was you
03:44:06 live at one of those times or places and this place still exists in this world today that
03:44:10 life is brutal and metal and whatever all and short and painful would you still want it and again as i'm
03:44:17 sitting here not not on fire physically it's easy to say yes but i would i'm confident i still
03:44:24 i'll plant my feet and say yes any of life any life is amazing and beautiful and a gift an unbelievable gift that none of
03:44:30 us have earned for the record i hate the word earned a lot of times earn yeah you earn but it's like
03:44:36 there's a lot a lot of good fortune in earning and that's back to do i want justice or do i want
03:44:42 grace and i guess we're all fortunate to be where we are no matter where we are and hopefully it should give us
03:44:47 some sense of perspective some sense of compassion for other people but also like like you said a sense of peace if
03:44:53 it all ended right now would i be happy with what i with a life to this point of course
03:44:58 would you like to live a little longer yeah i would try to do more and try to live rightly to the best that
03:45:04 i know how which over time will hopefully continue to evolve in a positive direction
03:45:10 but if the answer to that is no i i guess  that's that's always that's a sign that that what i'm doing
03:45:16 is not what i'm meant to be doing and i mean you're familiar with the tecumseh before so there's a i've got one
03:45:22 actually if you could give me 10 seconds i'll i'll read this one out this is a personal favorite basically and i
03:45:28 think it sums up i mean again like it's one of those quotes on the internet like when abraham lincoln said don't believe
03:45:32 everything you read online but  this is you know i it's again  attributed but it's like so
03:45:39 live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart trouble knowing about their
03:45:43 religion respect others in their view and demand that they respect yours love your life perfect your life
03:45:49 beautify all things in your life seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people
03:45:54 prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide always give a word or sign a salute when
03:46:00 meeting or passing a friend even a stranger when when in a lonely place show respect to all people and grovel to none
03:46:07 when you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living if you see no reason for giving thanks
03:46:13 the fault lies only in yourself abuse no one and no thing for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs
03:46:19 the spirit of its vision when it comes your time to die be not like those whose hearts are filled with
03:46:23 the fear of death so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live
03:46:27 their lives over again in a different way sing your death song and die like a hero going home
03:46:33 powerful words i don't think there's a better way to end it let me just say  we've spoke maybe five six years ago
03:46:42 i don't even remember when but i'm not exaggerating saying like you had a huge impact on my life because of the podcast
03:46:49 you're the reason i was doing the podcast as long as i have you're the reason i'm doing this podcast
03:46:56 and it's a little it's a stupid little meeting that you probably didn't know who i was
03:47:01 i didn't really know who you are it was just like a magical moment it's a flap of a butterfly wing kind of situation
03:47:07 and  yeah i'm forever grateful you're one of the most inspiring people in my life so ryan
