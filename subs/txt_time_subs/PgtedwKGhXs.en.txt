00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Steven Pressfield author of several powerful nonfiction and historical
00:00:09 fiction books including the war of art a book that had a big impact on my life and the life of millions of people whose
00:00:18 passion is to create an art science business sport and everywhere else I highly recommend it and others of his
00:00:28 books on this topic including turning pro do the work nobody wants to read your and the Warrior Ethos also his
00:00:38 books gets a fire about the Spartans and the Battle of Thermopylae the Lionsgate tides of war and others are some of the
00:00:46 best historical fiction novels ever written some of you know I don't shy away from taking on a big difficult
00:00:55 challenge one of the hardest for me for millions of others is the discipline of staring and an empty page every day
00:01:04 pushing on to think deeply to create despite the millions of excuses that fill the head in his work steven has

00:02:00 physics of our universe and the nature of human behavior intelligence consciousness love and power I will continue to return
00:02:10 home to the technical computer science machine learning engineering math programming but all

00:04:58 here's my conversation with Steven Pressfield modern society many ways dreams of creating universal peace and yet war has
00:05:09 molded civilization as we know it throughout his history so let's start at the high philosophically ville if you
00:05:18 could imagine a world without war how would that world be different perhaps put another way well purpose has
00:05:27 war served why do we fight I think we're basically the same creatures internally that we were in the
00:05:38 cave right in tribal society back for however many you know hundreds of thousands millions of years which means
00:05:46 that we're in our the dynamic in our mind is that kind of an us-versus-them dynamic where our tribe is the people
00:05:54 and everybody else are whatever you know and I don't see that I don't think that's changed one iota over the over
00:06:02 the centuries it's just a question of how how one might sublimate that that urge to compete you're a martial artist
00:06:13 you know that you know a great part of your day I'm sure is dedicated to reaching that place of you know of total
00:06:22 commitments and in the face of competition in the face of adversity at cetera et cetera which is I think
00:06:28 natural and great for the human race on an individual basis so the the hope that I have if there is any hope personally I
00:06:37 don't think the human race is gonna be around very long but would be in in sports or in other kind of sublimated
00:06:49 activities where people can act out their need for conquest or aggression or so forth but at the same time relate to
00:06:56 their opponents as human beings that when the game is over you know you embrace your competitors
00:07:02 stuff like that so you think war was inevitable it's a it's a part of human nature as opposed to a force a creative
00:07:12 force in society that serve the benefit well I'm sure it has benefited you know spreading cultures
00:07:20 and mixing cultures and stuff like that but I think the the urge to conquest if you think about Alexander the Great or
00:07:29 Julius Caesar Napoleon or anybody like that or any even individual or if we even think about one of the plants that
00:07:36 we're looking at right outside I mean if you let a particular plant have its way it would take over reading on the whole
00:07:45 hillside and certainly in the days of Alexander the Great let's say there were who knows over looking over the face of
00:07:52 the earth hundreds of little kingdoms China Japan you know Asia Europe wherever and every
00:08:01 prince that grew up dreamt of conquering his neighbor and conquering a neighbor after that that seems to be a universal
00:08:12 human imperative at least in the male of the species so where is this the realization of that imperative I think
00:08:20 so so you've written about Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae about Alexander the Great about the six-day
00:08:29 war in 67 in Israel against Egypt Jordan Syria what war not just out of those but in general do you think has been most
00:08:39 transformative for the world well he's a great questions Lex ah easy ones right I mean I wish I knew more about the
00:08:47 Mongols because I certainly from what I've what little I know I think that was a very their conquests was a very
00:08:56 transformative bringing cultures you know you know horrible bloody way together but gosh what's then the most
00:09:07 transformative maybe the Roman conquest you know establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture maybe
00:09:15 Alexander the Great's Wars that you know United East and West at least for a minute it's a building of empire do you
00:09:22 have a sense so there's Wars I mean the six-day war is not about building empires
00:09:35 it's about deep how deeply held religious cultural conflict and holding the line holding the border and then
00:09:45 there is conquests like the Mongols that what is it some large percentage of the population is a descendant of Genghis
00:09:52 Khan believed right so that has transformative effects in that in World War two I mean personally and my family
00:09:59 and so on the transformative effects let me ask you this Lex why are you what are you trying to get at with these
00:10:06 questions what is this kind of the theme that you're you're aiming here well I talked to Eric Weiss that and he said
00:10:14 everything is great about war except the killing and there's a romantic notion of war certainly this romantic notion of
00:10:24 being a warrior but there's a romantic notion of war that somehow there's a creative force to it that because we
00:10:36 fight out of that fighting comes culture comes music and art and more and more desire to create with the societies that
00:10:50 win and to me war is not just hey I have a stick and I want your land it's some kind of it like it has echoes of the the
00:11:04 creative force that makes humans unique to other animals like Wars you you it can't be just four people or 10 people
00:11:12 or 100 people you have to have thousands of people agreeing usually thousands or more for something so deeply that you
00:11:22 would be willing to risk your own life and there's a romantic notion to that and because you've written so well and
00:11:28 passionate about some of these I wanted to see because I don't have any answers I
00:11:34 wanted to untangle that if there is a reason we fight that's more than just anger and hate and wanting to conquer
00:11:45 well let me take it from a completely different side I don't think that I in writing about war am really that
00:11:55 interested in war per se I'm more interested in the metaphor I think for me I'm really writing about my own
00:12:05 internal war and and the war against myself and against my own resistance my own negativity all of those things that
00:12:18 are that spirituality would would be the opposite of so so I'm not really an expert on war it's not like talking to
00:12:29 Jim mattis or to you know Victor Davis Hanson or whatever to me the human being we are spiritual beings in a physical
00:12:45 envelope and there's a automatic terrible tension within that and and which creates a war inside ourselves so
00:12:55 the outer the outer war when I when I think about the Israeli army standing up to you know whatever 10 to 1 odds or
00:13:06 whatever it was that is a metaphor to me of the fight we were fighting inside ourselves it for me the six-day war was
00:13:13 as you know my feeling was it was about a return from exile it was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment of
00:13:20 the State of Israel which had never really been completed because the holiest places of the Jewish people were
00:13:29 in the hands of their enemies so now on the other hand Alexander the Great's conquests I think were a whole other
00:13:35 different scenario where the metaphor was that Alexander's father Philip I think created the first nation capital
00:13:43 and nation and he created a sort of a pathway for these guys who were mountain men and
00:13:56 basically barbarians Macedonians and Crete by creating this army and this dream of conquering the world which
00:14:06 Alexander took to the you know really enacted he gave them a way of rising out of themselves of transcending themselves
00:14:14 not just individually but as a people so that would go along with what you're saying Lex of a certain creativity to it
00:14:24 but but again that's not for whatever I'm just realizing this as I'm answering this that's not really what's
00:14:30 interesting to me about these stories and the Spartans to what was a hole at Thermopylae that was a whole other kind
00:14:40 of metaphor of war that was a sort of a willingly going to one's own death for a greater cause just like to me the
00:14:50 Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual a sacrifice of their lives
00:14:58 for the greater for the greater good I don't know if that answers your question but that's how I that's how I see it I
00:15:05 do feel like you know I get invited to speak to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time and I decline
00:15:12 because I don't really feel like I'm a spokesman for the warrior class or anything like that it's not that's not
00:15:25 what's interesting about it to me but didn't you just say with Wars a metaphor that we're all essentially in various
00:15:34 ways warriors if we think of it in terms of Union archetypes and think of our life as at least as some as males and
00:15:44 the earliest archetypes that kick in are the youth and the wanderer and the student and that kind of thing and then
00:15:50 at some point around age 15 to 20 whatever the warrior archetype kicks in and we want to play football I want to
00:15:57 do martial arts we want to join the Special Forces we want to hang out with our buddies that's our great bond we
00:16:03 want to test ourselves against adversity and so on and so forth but at some point that archetype we move beyond that
00:16:12 archetype and we become fathers and and teachers and so on and so forth and then there are many archetypes beyond that
00:16:21 towards the end so I'm I'm interested in the warrior archetype but not to the be-all and end-all of everything else
00:16:31 you know there's a in in my book the virtues of war I have you read that there's a character named telamon who's
00:16:42 actually it's a long story but when he's with Alexander's army and when they arrive in India he becomes fascinated by
00:16:53 the gymnast fists the the naked wise men the the Yogi's and he says to Alexander that these guys are our
00:17:05 warriors beyond what we are even though they do nothing because they are inside their own selves you know all day long
00:17:17 if we if we go to the Six Day War you write about in Lionsgate you write about the six-day war in Israel I think of the
00:17:25 wars you've written about it's the one we're still in many ways in the midst of today yes so what is it the core of that
00:17:35 conflict and the israeli-palestinian conflict I mean today it's the israeli-palestinian
00:17:43 conflict but it's  echoes of the same conflict in that part of the world with Israel what is in your sense the nature
00:17:54 of that conflict what can we learn about society and human nature from that conflict that is one of the hottest
00:18:01 conflicts that still goes on today well when I was working on the Lionsgate about the six-day war I wrote in the in
00:18:11 the introduction that this was not going to be a multi-sided story I was taking it entirely I'm a Jew I identify with
00:18:21 the Israeli people I was gonna see it entirely from their side so that's probably not what you're asking but to
00:18:33 me the six-day war and that whole you know it's it's a piece of land that's holy to at least three religions and
00:18:43 probably more and from the Jewish point of view it's where the State of Israel it's where David founded Jerusalem it's
00:18:50 all whether twelve tribes were etc.etc Moses came and brought the people so to to me the the the six-day war was about
00:19:00 as I said a return from exile from diaspora after 2,000 years now obviously from the Palestinian point of view or
00:19:08 the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever as it's a whole other scenario the religion is at the core of this
00:19:15 conflict in some ways the religious beliefs religion and racial / ethnic tribal identity I mean what is a Jew is
00:19:25 a Jew somebody that believes in the religion or is it somebody of a certain race that who that race arose in a
00:19:32 certain place same thing as a Muslim what is a Muslim and they believe in you know Muhammad or whatever or did they
00:19:39 arise in a certain place and a certain ethnicity because if we landed from Mars we couldn't tell a Jew from a
00:19:46 Palestinian could we you know just looking at them you could easily mix them and you'd never know and the the
00:19:52 specifics of the faith is not necessarily the thing that defines no person I don't think so the be like many
00:20:02 are secular Jew living in Israel and still have a strong bond only definitely in fact almost all of the Jews the
00:20:11 fighters that I spoke to from the six-day war were secular and it really was not you know a religious thing with
00:20:21 them as much as it was a national thing so having spent time in Israel how's the world where military conflict is
00:20:31 directly felt as opposed to maybe if we look at the US was distant and far away how is that world different how are the
00:20:38 people different it's very different as you know yeah I've never been to Israel actually we haven't even felt it ah well
00:20:49 you should definitely go I mean here in the United States where when like there's an incident like Charlottesville
00:20:56 comes up you know where people are chanting Jews will not replace us blah blah blah the impulse and the Jewish
00:21:03 community is to think about how can we reach out to the other side you know how can how can we show them that we are
00:21:11 human beings like they are and show them that we care for them at cetera et cetera that's the sort of distant from
00:21:20 war from if you're in Israel and you know like if you and I were we're Israeli citizens right now you would be
00:21:26 a fighter pilot or a tank commander or whatever you know you would not just be as you know working at MIT or whatever
00:21:34 and I would be in the Army too and so from their point of view they say all those people who hate us can I curse on
00:21:42 this court this thing that them will kill them kill you know if they dare to cross the line and that's
00:21:49 they're a whole different point of view to me it's actually a healthier point of view you think so
00:21:55 yeah there's no so let me ask the hard question is well maybe it's an impossible questions
00:22:03 how do we resolve that conflict in Israel and in Israel or anywhere anywhere where the instinct is to reach
00:22:13 out in us and say a few and in the people yeah here's my here's I think that the only way that two warring sides
00:22:20 or two sides that are opposed to one another can ever really come together is when there's mutual respect we get to
00:22:26 some more water when there's mutual respect and and and as and they can see each other as equals
00:22:35 and theirs and when there's mutual fear you know where where one side says we don't dare cross a line with this other
00:22:42 side and the other side says the same thing I think then you can kind of reach across that thing and say okay they will
00:22:49 stay here you stay here we'll we'll mingle in cultural ways in will have interchange you know winter marriage dah
00:22:57 dah dah but as soon as one side has no power as the Jewish people have had no power throughout the Diaspora forever
00:23:06 right then it's just a human nature you can see it in Trump and what he does to any vulnerable minority right it's
00:23:17 it's and he's not alone I'm not blaming chemo alone that's human nature so I do think that that idea of like you if
00:23:24 you cross the line will kill you it's really a good way is it's a good place to start from because now you can sit
00:23:30 down on opposite sides of the table and say you know what do we have in common how can we we want to raise our children
00:23:37 you want to raise your children how can we do this in a way that's that we're not hurting each other so you kind of
00:23:45 said that he to arrive at a ballot some kind of balance of power yet you haven't spoken to the fact that there is deeply
00:23:52 rooted hatred of the other so is there no way to alleviate that hatred or is that I mean
00:24:03 what what role does love but hatred can go away I really do I mean if you look at even even now that I haven't seen
00:24:10 this in person but they say that the Saudis and the Israelis are collaborating on certain things you know
00:24:17 by their mutual fear of or antagonism to Iran I do think that even really long long long standing hatreds and
00:24:28 animosities thousands of years old can can go away under the right circumstances in  on what timescale I
00:24:37 mean that for instance I don't know that somebody thinking people have to die do generations have to die and pass away
00:24:43 and new generations come up with less hate or can a single individual learn to not hate I think a single individual can
00:24:49 learn to not hate because it certainly doesn't seem to over thousands of years doesn't seem to work you know we keep
00:24:55 thinking that that's going to happen but I think it's we're in a real spiritual realm here when you're talking about
00:25:03 that you're in a realm of you know Buddha Jesus whatever something like that that we're a you know a a true
00:25:14 change of soul it happens but I do think that's possible so what do you think is the future of warfare especially with
00:25:25 what many people see is the expansion of the military industrial conflict to what do you I know you're not a military historian
00:25:36 I'm asking more as a metaphor and we'll do you see us as people continuing to fight you know it's a really great
00:25:44 question likes because because I think now with social media TV movies all of these things that create empathy across
00:25:56 cultures it becomes harder and harder I think I think to totally demonize the other the way it was in previous Wars I
00:26:07 also think I don't really see an appetite for people wanting to go to war these days I and in a way I don't know
00:26:15 if that's good or bad it's like everybody's so fat and lazy and so concerned with how many clicks they're
00:26:24 getting that you know whereas I know at the start of World War one that both the younger generations were eager to go to
00:26:33 war you know I think it was it was it was insane but it was that sort of warrior archetype that we were talking
00:26:42 about before that that generational testosterone arrows thing wears nowadays I don't know I mean it's hard to say
00:26:52 there's not gonna be another war because there always are but it's sort of hard to imagine people getting off their ass
00:26:59 these days to do anything well it's funny that you mention social media as the place for empathy sure but it's in a
00:27:07 sense that's the place for for war or death from hatred and and perhaps the positive aspects of hatred on social
00:27:19 media is that it's somewhat less harmful than murder and so it kind of dissipates sort of the
00:27:30 hate folds you get the hate out at yeah and  you know it'll s yeah on a daily basis and thereby never boils up to a
00:27:39 point where you want to kill it's also a really weird thing that's going on I don't know if anybody really understands
00:27:47 like with videogames where kids are acting out these incredible horror things right but you know that if they
00:27:53 cut their finger they would like freak out I know and and I also don't think that many of the people that are hateful
00:28:03 on social media if they were face to face with the horse and they wouldn't so there's a sort of a to to mental spheres
00:28:13 happening at the same time and I don't know how that maps that out military how that actually Maps the military
00:28:22 yeah yeah it's like when you uni United States have a draft for example what how the populace will respond different than
00:28:29 they did in previous generation yeah I think they certainly would yeah another question not sure if you thought
00:28:36 about it but I work on building artificial intelligence systems in our community many people worried about AI
00:28:42 being used in war so automating the killing process the with with with drones and in general is being used more
00:28:48 and more I should recuse myself on that when I really haven't thought about haven't
00:28:53 thought about it I'd rather ask you are you thinking well it's interesting I mean because
00:28:58 it's so fundamentally different from if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae it means just if we talk about the
00:29:07 different scene a gun and a sword I'll tell you one Atlanta coat there was a Spartan King I don't know
00:29:14 which one it was but at one point they showed him a new invention and it could launch a bolt that would you know kill
00:29:22 someone at a range of 200 yards and the king wept and said alas valor is no more was there a point of view of war it was
00:29:35 highly ritualized as you know and the the the code of honor was that you were not supposed to be able to kill another
00:29:42 person unless you yourself were an equal danger of being killed and any other way of doing that even bow and arrow was
00:29:52 considered less than manly and less than honorable and maybe we should go back to that because at least it makes the
00:30:01 stakes real and true and not that we could not not that's the point you were in the Marine Corps so if we talk about
00:30:13 the real the bloody conflicts you've written about many of them so let me ask a personal question
00:30:23 have you sort of as writing and in general have you thought about what it takes to kill a person if you yourself
00:30:33 could do it yeah well not about it yeah and how that would make you feel of course one never knows I certainly I have not
00:30:42 been in combat I haven't killed anybody but I would imagine in the real world that it would change you utterly forever
00:30:59 because you can't help but identify with a person that you've just killed and it's another human being and I mean I
00:31:07 have a hard time killing a spider so I would imagine that it's something that warriors understand and nobody else
00:31:16 understands and he's spoken with many how I mean you've spoken with people who seem military combat oh yeah in Israel
00:31:25 what have they been able to articulate the the experience of killing it's this sort of just what I said I mean I'm even
00:31:35 thinking of one pilot that I interviewed over there who you know was strafing a tank in his Mustang and saw and at
00:31:49 really low altitude and you know saw what his bullets did to the guy and could see his face and everything like
00:31:55 that which is even you know one remove or more removes from an infantryman when an infantryman does and he said that
00:32:02 that same thing that I said that it just changes you and you can never say it they never look at the world or look at
00:32:08 anything the same way again and when that happened that scale the thousands the thousands of hundred yeah that
00:32:15 changes entire societies that's what we've seen well at least it but the problem is it doesn't change the
00:32:21 politicians back home right how important is mortality finiteness the the fact that this thing
00:32:34 ends to the creative process so killing in war really emphasizes that but in general the fact that this thing ends
00:32:49 gee it does it does and I was serious no do you think about your own mortality do you meditate on your own
00:32:56 mortality when you think about the work you do other great question Lex actually I'm 75 and I just was having I had
00:33:05 breakfast in New York a few months ago with a friend of mine who spiked my exact same age and I said to him I said
00:33:12 Nick do you ever think about mortality and he said every minute every day and I was kind of relieved to hear
00:33:21 that because I do I do too but I actually I always have I think and I think you know the fact of mortality
00:33:32 is kind of gives meaning to life you know I think that's why we want to create that's why we want to make a mark
00:33:43 of some kind or and the other aspect of it is what's on the other side of that mortality I'm a believer in previous
00:33:53 lives so I I sort of and I the question I've never been able to answer among many many others just like why are we
00:34:01 even here right why are we in the flesh you know I sort of I like to believe that God or some force is we're on some
00:34:13 kind of journey but I'm not sure why why we were put in this world where the ground rules are if you think about
00:34:21 animal life that you cannot live from one day to the next without killing and eating some other form of life and what
00:34:29 a demented thing yeah you know why couldn't we just have a solar panel on our head and you know be friends with
00:34:38 everybody so I sort of I don't get what that was all about but that's sort of the big issue I have you read
00:34:45 the earners Becker's denial of death for example is that Ernest Becker is a philosopher that said that the death
00:34:56 that the fear of death is really the primary driver of everything we do so Freud had what the right I would agree
00:35:01 with that so did you you've always thought about your even your own mortality yes
00:35:11 definitely and can you elaborate on the the reincarnation aspect what you were talking about like that we kind of
00:35:18 what's your sense that we had previous lies in what have you thought concretely or is it a lot of it kind of as no I
00:35:27 thought can concretely about really I mean it's very clear when you see children young kids or even dogs and
00:35:38 cats that they come into the world with personalities you know and three kids and a family are going to become
00:35:43 completely different and completely their own person and and and that person that they are doesn't change over life
00:35:52 and I you know there's one of the things that I did in my book the artist journey is that there were certain things where
00:36:03 I tracked or just listed in order like all of Bruce Springsteen's albums or all of Philip Roth's books you know kind of
00:36:10 a body of work throughout over you know a period of 30 40 50 years you know and you can see that there's a theme running
00:36:19 through all of those things that it's completely unique to that person nobody else could have written Philip Roth's
00:36:28 books or Bruce Springsteen songs and you can even see sort of a destiny there so I asked myself well where did that come
00:36:38 from what it's it seems to be a continuation of something that was that happened before and that will lead to
00:36:45 something else because it's not starting from scratch it seems like there's a a calling a destiny in there already
00:36:54 this gets back to the Meuse and all that kind of thing so yeah it's almost like the there's this let's call it a God
00:37:04 it's passing it's almost like sampling parts of a previous human that has lived and putting that those into the new one
00:37:13 sampling this is probably a pretty good work that taking some of the good boy you can't take all the good parts
00:37:18 because the bad parts is what makes the person right let's say taking all together okay
00:37:23 this is humans only does it pass around from animals in your view is they I don't know that's above my pay grade I
00:37:31 don't know so okay see you talk about the muse as the source of ideas maybe since you've gotten a few glimpses of
00:37:48 her in your writing tell me let me what is it possible for you to tell me about about her
00:37:54 where does she reside what does she look like I mean you can look at in many different ways right the Greeks did it
00:38:00 in an anthropomorphic way right they created gods or like human beings but if you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish
00:38:09 perspective Jewish mysticism you could say that it's the solo neshama right that the soul is above us on a higher
00:38:16 plane our own your soul my soul and it's trying to reach down to us and and communicate with us and we're trying
00:38:24 simultaneously to reach up to it to it through prayer or through if you're a writer or an artist you know when you
00:38:32 sit down at the keyboard you're entering into a kind of prayer you're entering into a different state of an altered
00:38:39 consciousness to some extent you're opening yourself opening the pipeline or turning on the radio to tune into the
00:38:47 cosmic radio station and another way of looking at it this is Anna do you ever see the movie City of Angels the visual
00:38:58 of the movie it was meg Ryan and Owen the game yeah I've seen a hip and right the visual of the movies
00:39:09 was meg Ryan is a heart surgeon and as she's operating on somebody suddenly Nicolas Cage in this long duster coat
00:39:17 like Jesse James appears right next to her in the operating woman he's an angel and he's waiting to take out the soul of
00:39:25 the Prairie patient on the on the operating table and she doesn't see him she's totally unaware of him and so is
00:39:31 everybody else in the operating room except maybe the guy who's about to die I suddenly sees him but I kind of
00:39:40 believe that that there are beings like that or if you don't like that it's a force it's a consciousness it's
00:39:48 something that are right here right now and we and they're trying to communicate to us and like through a membrane like
00:39:59 tapping on that window over there they're like right out there and they carry the future they are everything
00:40:08 that is in potential all the works that you will do Lex your startup whatever else you're doing they they know that
00:40:20 and it's not really you that's coming up with those ideas in my opinion those things are appearing you know it's like
00:40:26 somebody knocks on the door yeah and puts it in I mean in the Iliad where gods and goddesses appear along with the
00:40:36 human antagonists on the battlefield all the time right they'll be you know Homer flashes to Olympus and then back to the
00:40:43 real world and there's the thing where one Aphrodite let's say wants to help Paris and so she says well I will appear
00:40:53 to him in a dream and I'll take the form of his brother and I'll say bumpety bumpety bump so that's creatures beings
00:41:04 on one dimension as the Greek sought communicating with and I believe that that's exactly what's going on in one
00:41:12 whatever analogy you want to use that that communication to which degree is do you play the role in that
00:41:21 communication as opposed to sitting at the computer if you're a writer and staring at the blank page and putting in
00:41:32 the time and waiting what so if in your basically waiting to tell you about your future or is their choice how many
00:41:46 possible futures are there how many possible ideas are that's a great question I think there's basically yes
00:41:54 they're all alternatives you know degrees within it but IFIF you look at Bruce Springsteen's albums how
00:42:04 much could he have done really differently yeah he would you can just see there's a whole impetus we're going
00:42:12 through the whole thing and nothing was gonna shake him off that you know and yeah maybe the river could have been
00:42:17 different it could have been called something else but but he was dealing with certain issues his conscious self
00:42:25 was dealing with certain issues that were really out of his control he was he was drawn he was called to it right
00:42:35 nothing could stop him and so it is sort of a partnership but I think the creative process between the creative
00:42:42 impulse that's coming from some other place or it's coming from deep within us is another way to look at it you know
00:42:51 it's a like if we are acorns and and we're growing then to Oaks so the conscious bird artist who's sitting
00:43:00 there at the keyboard or whatever is applying his or her consciousness to that but is also going into opening
00:43:10 themselves to the unconscious or to this other realm whatever whatever that is I mean certainly songwriters for a million
00:43:17 years have said you know a song just came in over their head right home just all I had to do is write but then you
00:43:24 ever see that thing where of Keats's notes for a thing of beauty is a joy forever it's like covers an entire pay
00:43:31 it's like you know he's crossing this out and that out yet so though his consciousness is his conscious mind is
00:43:38 working on it but I saw I I do think it's a partnership and I think that I know when I was first starting out as a
00:43:46 writer I worked in advertising and I and I tried to do novels that I could never do I was like really unskilled at
00:43:55 getting to that tuning into that station I just beat my brains out and was unable to do it you know except and because I
00:44:05 was sort of trying too hard it was sort of like a Zen monk or a monk of some kind trying to meditate and just like
00:44:13 constantly thoughts driving you crazy but overtime you know not would I've kind of gotten better at it and I can
00:44:23 sort of let go of those that part of me that's trying so hard and so these angels can speak a little more easily
00:44:33 through the membrane can you put into words the process of letting go and clearing that channel of communication
00:44:41 what does it take that's like another great question for me it just took I took probably thirty years and I don't
00:44:48 even I would I guess I would liken it to meditation even though I'm not a meditator but it would seem to me to be
00:44:54 one of the hardest things in the world to just sit still and stop thinking right and so it's very hard to put into
00:45:04 words and I think that's why these teachers of meditation use tricks and cones and stuff like that but for me at
00:45:15 least I think it was just a process of years of years and years of trying and finally of beating my head in the wall
00:45:22 and finally little by little giving up the bet beating of the the head but this doesn't seem to be any trick everybody
00:45:30 wants a tack these days and I don't think there is a hack I look at it in terms of the goddess the muse he's
00:45:40 watching you down there beating your head in the ball you're like a marine going through an obstacle course
00:45:45 so a martial artist trying to learn you know like uma Thurman during the casket they'll try to make that little for its
00:45:55 punch you know the muse or the goddess is just sort of watching on Lexi's turn saying I'm gonna come back in another
00:46:01 couple of months and see if he's still there yeah and finally she'll say all right he's had it
00:46:08 he's beaten he's paid his dues I'm gonna give it to him so the the hard work and the suffering yep
00:46:16 but you know I'm also being Russian  in wrestling and martial arts were big into drilling technique I was also just
00:46:24 even getting at there's certainly there's no shortcut but is there a process so your aunt the practice that
00:46:34 can be the process of practice so you had to one yet an example of meditation so it's essentially the practice of
00:46:43 meditation is you I think so same drill I think is a good way to look at it too but what do you what are you drilling
00:46:50 you're just sitting and you're you're writing you know just writing you're writing your then you're looking at what
00:46:57 you wrote you know you're hitting moments when it flows you know and your and your and in your other hitting
00:47:03 moments well you just can't do anything and you're trying to from the moments that weren't flowed you're trying to
00:47:09 come back and look at and say what what did I do how did it how did that happen or was in
00:47:14 my mind you know but I think it's just a process of over and over and over and over until finally it gets a little bit
00:47:24 easier and did you did you always when you when you read something you write did you always have a pretty good radar
00:47:31 for what's good enough after it's written no I think I do now but but no it was always really hard for me to know
00:47:47 what was good I mean do you edit the process of editing is the process of looking at what you've written and
00:47:55 improving it are you but a writer or an editor how often do you edit that's another great question great question because I
00:48:02 do think that in writing the real process of looking at it is the process that an editor does rather than what a
00:48:09 writer does the gentleman I was just talking about the phone is my editor Sean Cohen who was the guy who bought
00:48:15 gates of fire when he was an editor at doubleday and who basically when I finish a book I give it to him and he
00:48:26 and he gives me you know he he editing doesn't really mean like crossing out commas it really means looking at the
00:48:35 overall work and saying does it work and if it doesn't work why doesn't it work is there something wrong here you know
00:48:42 like if you were building the Golden Gate Bridge you know and one span was out of whack you know you could and I
00:48:50 think a really skilled editor what Sean is understands what what makes a story tick and he also has the perspective
00:48:59 that I've lost and something I've wrote because I'm so close to it to say you know this you know this isn't working
00:49:06 and that is working what kind of advice is he giving you is it like lay out like this story doesn't flow correctly like
00:49:14 it's you shouldn't start at this point or does he even sit back at a higher level and say I see what you're doing
00:49:21 but you could do better no he doesn't do that okay but a lot of it is about genre and kind of the
00:49:31 defining what genre you're working in and I'm gonna get up here to Jim this was one where Sean tore this down and
00:49:45 made me start from scratch and what the the specifics of it were really this is a supernatural thriller that's the genre
00:49:54 sort of like Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist and what he made what he showed me was that I kind of I had violated
00:50:03 certain conventions of the genre you know that and you can't do that you know it's got to be
00:50:11 you know it has to be done the right way and so he pointed out certain things to me he must be a prolific reader himself
00:50:24 - actually that's such an it's a tough job of editor yeah again he was sort of born to do that he just kind of glommed
00:50:34 onto it and and but since he was his first job publishing you know cat fur Hillhurst you know cat detective but you
00:50:45 know he studied how it works what makes a story work etc etc so he really he's great and I think any really successful
00:50:53 writer unless they're utterly brilliant on their own has got to have a great editor behind them but you yourself edit
00:51:01 as well I'm constantly trying to learn from him and teach myself everything you see in my blog posts about that it's
00:51:10 about the craft of writing is me trying to teach myself the rules so that you know I'm sure it's the same in martial
00:51:17 arts or anything else right you you try to not be dependent on that other person because it's so painful to make those
00:51:25 mistakes you really feel like god I wish I could get it right the first time the next time I do it well research would go
00:51:32 through that in research more than writing so what you do is a little more solitary in research there's
00:51:38 usually two three four people working on something together and we write a paper and there's that painful process of
00:51:44 where you write it down and then you share it with other and not only do they criticize the writing they criticize the
00:51:53 fundamental aspects of the approach you've taken I would think so so that's exactly like you know they would say
00:51:59 you're attacking you're asking the wrong questions right - yeah and that's extremely you know pay off especially
00:52:04 when you it was yes painful and helpful but there's disagreement and so on
00:52:11 it's and through that comes out a better product yeah and if is you want to still have an ego but you also want to silence
00:52:18 it every once in a while so there's a balance in your book the war of art you talk about resistance with
00:52:26 capital R as the invisible force in this universe of ours that finds a way to prevent you from starting or doing the
00:52:38 work where do you think resistant comes from why is there force in our mind that's constantly trying to jeopardize
00:52:45 our efforts with laziness excuses and so on that's another great question I mean in in Jewish mysticism in Kabbalistic
00:52:54 thinking it's called the yetzer Hara right and it's a force that if this up here is your soul of neshama trying to
00:53:01 talk to you us down here the answer Harrah's this negative force in the middle so I'm not
00:53:07 the only one that ever thought about this but and I don't know if anybody really knows the answer but here's my
00:53:18 answer I think that there are two places where we as human beings can seat our identity one is the ego a conscious ego
00:53:26 and the other is the greater self and the self in the in the Union sense the self in a Jungian sense includes the
00:53:35 unconscious and butts up against what Jung called the divine ground which what I would call the muse the goddess or whatever
00:53:42 and I think and the ego is just this little dot inside this bigger self and the ego has a completely different view
00:53:53 of of life as from the self the ego believes I'm going to give you a long answer here like no perfect the ego
00:54:01 believes that death is real the ego believes that time and space are real the ego believes that each one of us is
00:54:09 separate from the other I'm separate from you I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me it
00:54:17 would only hurt you and in the egos world the dominant emotion is fear because we were all made of flesh we can
00:54:25 all die we can all be hurt we can all be ruined bumpity-bump so we were protecting ourselves and even our desire
00:54:31 to create as we were talking about before comes out of that fear of death the self on the other hand
00:54:38 the crater self that butts up against the divine ground believes that death is not real that time and space are not
00:54:46 real that the gods travel swiftest thought and the ego also believes that I mean the self believes that there's no
00:54:54 difference between you and me that we're all one if I hurt you I hurt myself karma right and in the world of the self
00:55:04 of the greater self the dominant emotion is love not fear now so I think that let me I'll go farther back here a long way
00:55:15 to answer your question when Jesus died on the cross or when the 300 Spartans willingly sacrificed their lives at
00:55:25 Thermopylae they were acting according to the rules of the self death is not real no difference between you and me
00:55:34 time and space are not real predominant emotion is love so in my opinion we as conscious human vessels have are in a
00:55:46 struggle between these two things the ego and the self to me resistance is the voice of the ego saying and it's a
00:55:58 fearful voice because if when we identify with the self we move our consciousness over to the self as as
00:56:06 artists or scientists opening ourselves up to the cosmic dimension to the to the other forces the ego is tremendously
00:56:14 threatened by that because if we're if we're in that space that headspace we don't need the ego anymore so I think
00:56:24 resistance is a voice of the ego trying to keep control of us you there in a way I'll give you a bad example Trump is the
00:56:32 ego it's probably a very good example right you know it's a zero-sum world for him yes and for anybody that's in that
00:56:43 and the opposite of that would be somebody like Martin Luther King or Gandhi and that's of course why they all
00:56:50 wind up getting assassinated because that voice that ego is hanging on to itself and feels so threatened
00:57:01 yeah by I could talk more about this if you want to know for sure that that's that's fascinating is just it's
00:57:08 interesting why the fear is attached the ego I really like this dichotomy of ego and self and that struggle
00:57:18 it's just ego has a you know the the self obsession of it why why fear such a predominant thing like why is resistance
00:57:30 trying to undermine everything the it's very here it's out of fear let's think about the whole thing in terms of
00:57:40 stories in a story the villain is always resistance is always the ego the hero is is always of course always not
00:57:47 everything but you know what I mean pretty much it represents kind of the self if you think about the alien on the
00:57:54 spaceship that's like the ultimate kind of villain it keeps changing form right first it goes on the guy's face then it
00:58:02 pops out of his chest but it always just has that one monomaniacal thing to destroy you know and just like the ego
00:58:14 just like resistance and maybe alien is a bad example because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of fight on the same terms
00:58:22 as as the alien but maybe a better example might be something like Casablanca where in the end the Pumphrey
00:58:31 Bogart character has to acting operating out of the self has to give up his his selfish dream of going off with Ingrid
00:58:40 Bergman Nilsa lund the love of his life and instead you know puts around the plane to Lisbon while he goes off to
00:58:48 fight the Nazis and you know in the desert I don't know if that's clear but in a but in almost every story the villain is
00:58:59 the ego its resistance is fear is that zero-sum thing and in almost every story the hero is someone that is willing to
00:59:11 make a sacrifice to help others it's letting go of that fear is what leads the productivity into success yeah
00:59:22 do you think there's a it that's probably the answer is either obvious or impossible but do you think there's an
00:59:30 evolutionary advantage to resistance like what would life look like without resistance that sort of that's another
00:59:40 great question I think I also believe that resistance like death gives a meaning to life right if we didn't have
00:59:49 it it's gonna be you know what would we be we'd be in the Garden of Eden picking fruit and just happy and stupid you know
00:59:58 and I do think that that myth of the Garden of Eden is really about this kind of thing you know where where Adam and
01:00:04 Eve decide to sort of take matters into their own hands and and acquire knowledge that until then God had said
01:00:13 I'm the only one that's got that knowledge and of course once they have acquired that knowledge they're cast out
01:00:20 into the world you and I live in now where they do have to deal with that fear and they do have to deal with all
01:00:27 that stuff is the human condition the human condition and the meaning and the purpose comes from the resistance being
01:00:38 there and the struggle to overcome it the overcoming right that's and also the other aspect of it is that it's not real
01:00:47 at all it's not even like it's an actual force it's all here right so the the sort of in a way it's sort of a
01:01:03 surrender to it you know you know or like turning on the light in a dark thing it's like it's gone but not quite
01:01:11 because it's not quite because it comes back again tomorrow morning exactly so you have to keep changing lightbulbs
01:01:19 every day so what's been  maybe recently but in general maybe you know life what's been the most relentless or
01:01:26 one of the more relentless sources of resistance to you personally I mean it's always the same it's about writing for
01:01:37 me and an evolving within my own body of work you know it never goes away it never gets any less you have particular
01:01:48 excuses particular justifications that come out no it's always the same well I would say it's always its same but it's
01:01:55 really not because resistance is so protein you know it keeps changing form and as you as you move to hopefully a
01:02:04 higher level resistance gets a little more nuanced and a little more subtle trying to fake you out but I think you
01:02:12 learn that it's always there and you're always gonna have to face it so I mean you're but your battle is
01:02:21 sitting down and writing to some number Awards to a blank page yeah give a process there with his battle you have a
01:02:31 number of hours you put end honestly yeah I'm definitely a a believer that even though this battle is fought on the
01:02:40 highest sort of spiritual level that the way you fight it is on the most mundane I'm sure it's like martial arts must be
01:02:47 the same way I mean I go to the gym first thing in the morning and I sort of am rehearsing myself faced you know the
01:02:56 gym is called resistance training right you're working against resistance right yeah and I don't want to go I don't want
01:03:03 to get out of bed I hate that you know so but I'm sort of fortifying myself to to be ready for the day and you know
01:03:13 like I said over not would over years I've learned to sort of get into the right kind of mindset and
01:03:19 it's not as hard for me as it used to be the real resistance I think for me and I think this is true for anybody is the
01:03:27 question of sort of what's the next idea what's the next book what's the next project that you're going to work on and
01:03:33 when I when I ask that question I'm sorry I'm asking it of the muse I'm kind of saying what do you want me or I'm
01:03:40 asking it up my unconscious if we're looking at Bruce Springsteen's albums it's kind of well what's the next album
01:03:46 you know now he's on Broadway that was a great idea right where'd that come from you know
01:03:54 but and then for him what's what's after that you know because that that body of work is already alive it already exists
01:04:08 inside us canonical woman's biological clock and we have to serve it and we have to otherwise it'll give us cancer
01:04:18 you know I don't mean to say that if anybody has cancer that they're not yeah but you know what I mean it'll it'll do
01:04:24 it'll take it's a revenge on us so the next of the resistance to me is sort of well a big aspect of it is what's next
01:04:31 you know when I finish the book I'm working on now I'm not sure what I'm gonna do next
01:04:35 and I see at the same time you have a kind of you have a sense that there is a Bruce Springsteen single line of albums
01:04:48 so like it's it's already known somewhere in the universe what you're going to do next is the sense you have
01:04:53 in it in a sense yes I don't know if it's like predetermined you know but it's but there's something like that
01:05:02 yeah I'd like to believe that there's  was this kind of like quantum mechanics I guess once once you observe it maybe
01:05:12 once you talk to the muse it's it's it's one thing for sure it was always going to be that one thing but really in
01:05:19 reality it's a distribution it could be any number of things yeah I think so there's an alternate reality alternate
01:05:25 realities they're not that far apart I mean Bruce Springsteen is not gonna write you know a Joni Mitchell
01:05:31 you know no matter how hard he's probably when I'm brought I mean he still did that which is not a Bruce
01:05:37 Springsteen thing to do so I think I think you're being in retrospect I think it is making things you know it's a next
01:05:44 sort of evolution form why not take his music to there you know in retrospect it all makes sense I think yeah because he
01:05:54 if you pull it off especially do you visualize yourself completing the work like Olympic athletes visualize getting
01:06:03 the gold medal do you you know they that's they go through I mean that's actually a really you can
01:06:10 learn something from athletes on that is years out certainly two three years awesome some people do much longer
01:06:19 everyday you visualize how the day of the the championship will go yet down to I mean everything down to how will it
01:06:27 feel to stand on the podium and so on do you do anything like that you know how you approach writing
01:06:34 no because no moment because yeah it isn't a moment I think because it's such a mystery you just don't know I think
01:06:40 it's different from sports right because you don't know that this thing there's no gold medal
01:06:47 do you know in fact I would like to think and that as soon as you finish one the next day you're on the other and in
01:06:55 fact hopefully you've already started the other you're already you know one hundred pages into the other when you
01:07:10 it's a journey it's a process I don't think it is a in fact I think it's very dangerous to think that way to think
01:07:19 oh this I'm gonna win the Oscar you know it's interesting for the creative process it might be dangerous it
01:07:28 it's it's a maybe you can like why is it dangerous because I kind of Zoey go it's the e because you're giving yourself
01:07:37 over to the ego you know I keep saying this myself my job I'm a servant of the muse I am there to do what she tells me
01:07:47 to do and if I've suddenly think oh I'm really I just want to you know whatever news doesn't like that yeah and you know
01:07:57 yeah he's on another dimension for me I'm trying to square that cuz I agree I'm trying to square that with I think
01:08:07 there's a meditation to visualizing success in the athletic realm to where it focuses it removes everything else
01:08:16 away to where you focus on this particular battle I mean I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways
01:08:28 and in sports the ego serves a more important role I think than it does in writing any the ego there's something
01:08:36 well no let me when you say that I know what you mean Alexa do you think there is a sort of  you know it's
01:08:41 interesting to watch if interviews was with Steph Curry yeah who's such obviously such a nice guy but
01:08:53 he's got such tremendous self-confidence you know that it but it doesn't border on ego so much because he's worked so
01:09:03 hard for it you know but he knows so he has visualized he has visualized maybe not so much winning you know that as
01:09:11 just him being the best he can be him being in the flow you know doing his thing that he knows he can do and I do
01:09:21 think in the creative world yeah there is a sort of a thing like that where you were and you know a choreographer or a
01:09:31 filmmaker or whatever might be do an internal thing where they're saying I can make an oscar-winning movie
01:09:39 I can direct this movie you know I'm banishing these thoughts that I'm not good enough I can do that I can I can
01:09:45 edit it I can score it I can you know bump it a month a month but and I don't think that's really ego I think that's
01:09:53 that's part of the process in a good way like an athlete does that so extreme confidence is what some of the best
01:10:00 athletes come come with and you think it's possible to as a writer to have extreme confidence in yourself I do
01:10:07 think so you know that I'm sure when John Lennon sat down to write a song he felt like I can do this you know
01:10:17 I'm not so sure I I think I think is this the great artist has seen any that you're you're haunted by self-doubt
01:10:26 it's that resist I mean the confidence yes but I mean I guess but even beyond the cell and then the cell above the
01:10:32 self-doubt I was the biggest organ picks yourself the leaf you know some yeah I'm freaking out yeah I'm worried that I'm
01:10:37 not gonna be able to but you know I know I could do this yeah when you look at it when you take a bigger picture yeah so
01:10:46 the writing process is it fundamentally lonely so no and because you're with your characters you are so you really
01:10:59 put yourself in the world absolutely you know I've written about this before that I used to have my desk used to face a
01:11:06 wall instead of seeing and people would say well don't you want to look out the window but I'm I'm in here I mean I'm
01:11:13 seeing you know the Spartans I'm seeing you know whatever and the character characters that are on the page or that
01:11:21 you create are not accidents you know they're coming out of some issue some deep issue that you have whether you
01:11:29 realize it or not you might not realize it till twenty years later or somebody explains it to you so your characters
01:11:35 are kind of fascinating to you and their dilemmas are fascinating to you and you're also trying to to
01:11:43 come to grips with them you know you sort of see them through a glass darkly you know and you really want to see them
01:11:51 more clearly so yeah I know it's not lonely at all fact I'm more lonely sometimes later going out to dinner with
01:11:57 some people and actually talking to people do you miss the characters after it's over  let's say I have I have
01:12:07 affection for them kind of like children that have gone off to college and now our you know you only see them at
01:12:15 Thanksgiving definitely I have affection for even the bad guys maybe especially the bad guys especially the bad guys
01:12:28 you've said that writers even successful writers are often not tough minded enough I've read then post that you have
01:12:36 to be a professional in a way you handle your emotions you have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writer
01:12:46 so what are what do you think makes a warrior is that as a warrior born or trained in the realm and the bigger
01:12:53 realm in the realm of writing in the creative process I think I think they're born to some extent you have the gift
01:13:00 like you might have a gift as a martial artist to do whatever martial artists do but the training is the big thing
01:13:09 90% training 10% 10% genetics and you know I use another analogy other than warrior 2 as far as writers and it's
01:13:17 like to be a mother if you think about if you're a writer or any creative person you're giving birth to something
01:13:22 right you're carrying a new life inside you and in terms of bravery if your child your two-year-old child is
01:13:32 underneath a car is coming down the street the mothers are gonna splake stop a Buick you know with their bare hands
01:13:40 so that's a that's another way to think about how how a writer has to think about or any creative person has to
01:13:46 think about I think what they're what they're doing that what this this child this new creation that
01:13:54 they're bringing forth yeah so the hard work that's underlying that have just a couple weeks ago talked to just happen
01:14:02 to be in the same room both gave talks Arianna Huffington I did this conversation her I didn't know much
01:14:12 about her before before then but she has recently been short a couple books have been promoting a lifestyle where she
01:14:19 basically she created a huffington post and she gave herself like I don't know 20 hours a day just obsessed with her
01:14:29 work and then she she fainted passed out and kind of  there was some health issues and so she wrote this book saying
01:14:36 that you know sleep basically you want to establish a lifestyle that doesn't sacrifice health that's productive but
01:14:43 there's a sec of myself she thinks he can have both productivity and health criticizing Elon Musk who have also
01:14:51 spoken with for working too hard and thereby sacrificing you know being less effective than he could be so I'm trying
01:15:03 to get at this balance between health and obsessively working at something and really working hard so I'm what Arianna
01:15:12 is talking about it make sense to me when I'm a little bit torn to me passion and reason do not overlap much or at all
01:15:20 sometimes maybe I'm being too rushing but I feel madness and obsession does not care for health or sleep or diet or
01:15:31 any of that and hard work it's hard work and and everything else can go to hell so if you're really focused on whether
01:15:37 it's writing a book and it should everything should just go to hell where do you stand on this balance how
01:15:45 important is health for productivity how important is it to sort of get sleep and so on I'm from out of the health side
01:15:54 yeah I mean there was a period of my I had no obligations and I was just living in a little house and just
01:16:04 working non-stop you know but even then I would get up in the morning and I would have liver and
01:16:11 eggs for breakfast yeah every day and I would do my you know exercise whatever it was but although I was still doing
01:16:17 like you know 18 hours a day but I I'm definitely I kind of think of it sort of like an athlete does yeah I'm sure that
01:16:26 like Steph Curry is is totally committed to winning championships and stuff like that but he has his family he sees his
01:16:32 family you know the family is always there he I'm sure he eats you know perfect great stuff gets to sleep you
01:16:43 know gets that the the train you know though whatever a trainer does Silver's knees and ankles and whatever so I or
01:16:50 Kobe Bryant or anybody that's a it's operating in a high level so I do think I'm from that kind of the health school
01:16:57 the good thing about being a writer is it don't you can't work for many hours a day you know four hours is like the
01:17:04 maximum I can work I've never been able to work more than that I don't know how people do it
01:17:09 heard of people do ten twelve I don't know how they do it so that gives you a lot of other time to optimize your
01:17:18 health yeah because you need to you're in training you know you're you're really you're burning up a lot of B
01:17:24 vitamins when you're working here yeah but  maybe it's a Russian thing with you Lex
01:17:29 well it's not even a Russian thing I mean it also may be youth you know at 35 you can be crazy you know this this that
01:17:38 they they keep telling me but I'm pretty sure I'll be at it still at a later time too I think it has to do with the career
01:17:50 choice too I think writing is most for whatever thing I've heard it's almost impossible to do more than a few hours
01:17:57 really well the when you start to get into certain disciplines like oh I'm asking me engineering disciplines that
01:18:07 really there's a lot more non muse time meaning mmm right right so the crazy hours of your talk that you
01:18:18 often are talking about have to be done mm-hmm and it doesn't I think that's true yeah so there's still the two-three
01:18:26 hours of music time needed for truly genius ideas but it's  it's something it's something I'd certainly struggle
01:18:37 with but yeah I I hear you loud and clear on the health so what does the perfect day look like for you if we're
01:18:47 talking about writing an hour-by-hour schedule of a perfect day I get up early I go to the gym I have breakfast with
01:18:56 some friends of mine I welcome early by the way that's like a how 13 am a.m. so we're talking really
01:19:07 really early you know I'm crazy early it's ridiculously early yeah but and I haven't done that always but that's kind
01:19:16 of what what what I'm on now so I'm in bed like it when I'm with my my nephews that are like four years old and three
01:19:23 years old I'm in bed before them okay you got a beat you wake up it's a sorry you said exercise first yeah and what
01:19:31 does that look like what's exercise for you I go to the gym I have a trainer I have a couple guys that I work out with
01:19:41 and I'll you know it's maybe an hour maybe a little more I'll do a little warm-up before of stretching afterwards
01:19:49 take a shower go have breakfast but it's an intense kind of a thing that I definitely don't want to do that's hard
01:19:56 you know so you feel like you've accomplished something first thing yeah a big accomplishment of the day at the
01:20:02 same time it's not like so hard that I'm completely exhausted you know and then I'll come home and handle whatever
01:20:10 correspondence and stuff has to be done and then I work for maybe three hours and then I just sort of crash that the
01:20:18 office is closed I turn the switch I don't think about any I don't think about anything
01:20:23 I don't think about the work at all do you listen to Oh II mean afterwards after work once
01:20:29 the office is closed but during so this was like 12 to 3 kind of thing something like that something like that but the
01:20:36 you listen to music no if and yes that's just me I mean I don't think you know if somebody could this fast in different
01:20:42 ways it's fascinating you know the I mean you've also of most of many writers you've really but like I've heard even
01:20:53 Kingston writing is you've optimized this conversation with the muse you're having that optimized but you've at
01:21:01 least thought about it so what can you say a little bit more about the trivialities of that process of like you
01:21:12 said facing the wall what's do you have little ritual I mean like the granular aspect of granular aspects yeah
01:21:21 is there little rituals I do have all kinds of well I'm not even going to tell you I'm sure but the one thing and I
01:21:30 don't want to like to talk about this too much because it sort of jinxes things I think but the one thing I I do
01:21:36 try to do is when I then when I sit down I immediately get into it first second yeah I don't sit and around with
01:21:45 anything immediately try to get into it as as quickly as I can and the other thing is that writing a book or
01:21:51 screenplay or anything like that is a process of multiple drafts and it's the first draft that's where you're most
01:21:59 with the muse where you're going through the blank page like right now I'm on I don't know what the fifth or sixth
01:22:05 seventh draft of some other thing I'm working on so when I'm I've got pages already written and I'm kind of reading
01:22:13 them afresh as I as I go through the story so it's not quite where I am now it's not quite a deep muse scenario
01:22:24 partly it is but it's also sort of bouncing back and forth between the different between the right brain and
01:22:29 the left brain I'm kind of looking at it and trying to evaluate it then I'm going into it and try to change it a little
01:22:38 bit when  do you know sit down do you know the night before of what that starting point is yeah I always try
01:22:47 to stop and I learned this I think Hemingway wrote about this or done Steinbeck or one of the or maybe both of
01:22:53 them to always stop when you kind of know what's coming next so you're not I'd have facing a chasm you know yeah
01:23:01 okay so and afterwards when you're done the office is closed offices closed I let the muse take care of it you know I
01:23:07 don't know I don't want to and I think it's a very unhealthy thing to worry about it or think about any creative
01:23:17 process you don't I got a long walk later think about yeah if that then I will sort of keep my mind open to it but
01:23:24 I won't be like obsessing about it yeah there's a actually on walks sometimes things pop in your head you know and you
01:23:31 go oh I should change that but that's not your ego doing it that's a deeper level okay so how does the day end so in
01:23:41 terms of writing so yet the writing you know writing the the office door closes and then the rest of the day just do
01:23:50 whatever the hell maybe go out to dinner my girlfriend is not here now she's in New York working we'll make dinner or
01:23:57 whatever go out to dinner something like that and maybe maybe I'll read something nothing heavy and I go to bed pretty
01:24:08 early and the gym is a big thing for me already if sorry probably would you like with you with martial arts the
01:24:13 night before I'll be I'll be visualizing what I have to do the next day and getting myself psyched up for that and
01:24:22 then let's conk out like a light and wake up at the crack of dawn so looking out into the future
01:24:31 this year next few years what do you think the muse has in store for you I don't think you can ever know it's
01:24:39 probably something along the same I really believe you know there's that exercise where you where they say to you
01:24:47 visualize yourself five years in the future then write a letter to your from that person to yourself I don't
01:24:52 leaving that at all because I don't think you can you know there's a line in Out of Africa that God made the world
01:25:00 round so that we couldn't see too far ahead you just don't know as a writer or as a create a person you know I never knew my
01:25:11 first book was The Legend of Bagger Vance I hadn't before that happened I had no clue that I was gonna be writing
01:25:18 anything like that on that subject anything at all no clue until it just sort of came and then when I when that
01:25:25 was done people said well you got to write another I had no idea what it was which was going to be gates of fire no
01:25:33 clue so so if somebody'd sat me down at the start of that and asked the question I would have been crazy to say so I just
01:25:44 hope as as the future unfolds that I'm open to it you know well I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that we
01:25:55 look forward to with that that's thanks so much for talking satisfy yeah it's a great you got the best job in the world
01:26:00 going around talking to people that you want to talk to and that they will talk to you you know so thank you for doing
