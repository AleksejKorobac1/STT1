00:00:01 following is a conversation with Sebastian Thrun he's one of the greatest roboticists computer scientists and
00:00:09 educators of our time he led the development of the autonomous vehicles at Stanford that one 2005 DARPA Grand
00:00:16 Challenge and placed second in the 2007 DARPA urban challenge he then led the Google self-driving car program which
00:00:23 launched the self-driving car revolution he taught at the popular Stanford course on artificial intelligence in 2011 which
00:00:31 was one of the first massive open online courses or MOOCs as they're commonly called that experience led him to
00:00:38 co-found Udacity an online education platform if you haven't taken courses on it yet I highly recommended their
00:00:45 self-driving car program for example is excellent he's also the CEO of Kitty Hawk a company working on building flying cars
00:00:55 are more technically Evie tall's which stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft he has launched several
00:01:01 revolutions and inspired millions of people but also as many know he's just a really nice guy it was an honor and a
00:01:09 pleasure to talk with him this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy subscribe I need to
00:01:16 give it five stars and Apple podcasts follow it on Spotify supported on patreon or simply connect with me on
00:01:24 Twitter and Lex Friedman spelled Fri D ma M if you leave a review on Apple podcast or YouTube or Twitter consider
00:01:31 mentioning ideas people topics you find interesting it helps guide the future of this podcast but in general I just love
00:01:38 comments with kindness and thoughtfulness in them this podcast is a side project for me as many people know
00:01:45 but I still put a lot of effort into it so the positive words of support from an amazing community from you really helped
00:01:53 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode
00:01:59 and never any ads in the middle they can break the flow of the conversation I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt
00:02:06 the listening experience I provide time stamps for the start of the conversation that you can skip to but it helps if you
00:02:12 listen to the ad and support this podcast by trying out the product service being advertised this show is
00:02:19 presented by cash app the number one finance app in the App Store I personally use cash up to send money to
00:02:25 friends but you can also use it to buy sell and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds cash app also has a new investing
00:02:32 feature you can buy fractions of a stock say $1 worth no matter what the stock price is brokerage services are provided
00:02:40 by cash app investing a subsidiary of square and member has site PC I'm excited to be working with cash app to
00:02:46 support one of my favorite organizations called first best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions they
00:02:53 educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating and
00:02:59 charity navigator which means the donated monies used the maximum effectiveness when you get cash out from
00:03:06 the App Store or Google Play and use coal export gas you'll get ten dollars in cash up we'll also donate ten dollars
00:03:13 the first which again is an organization that I've personally seen inspired girls and boys the dream of engineering a
00:03:20 better world and now here's my conversation or Sebastian Thrun you mentioned that the matrix may be your
00:03:30 favorite movie so let's start with the crazy philosophical question do you think we're living in a simulation and
00:03:37 in general do you find the thought experiment interesting define simulation I would say maybe we are not but it's
00:03:45 completely irrelevant to the way we should act putting aside for a moment the fact that it might not have any
00:03:53 impact on how we should act as human beings for people studying theoretical physics these kinds of questions might
00:04:00 be kind of interesting looking at the universe's information processing system the universe is an information
00:04:06 processing system is a huge physical biological chemical computer there's no question but I live here and now I care
00:04:16 about people okay about us what do you think is trying to compute and I think there's an intention I think it just the
00:04:22 world evolves the way it devolves and it's it's beautiful is unpredictable and I'm really grateful to be alive
00:04:31 spoken like a true human which last time I checked that was oh that in fact this whole conversation is just a touring
00:04:38 test to see if if indeed if indeed you are you've also said that one of the first programs of the first few programs
00:04:47 you've written was a wait for a TI 57 calculator yep maybe that's early eighties I don't
00:04:54 wanna date calculators anything early eight is correct yeah so if you were to place yourself back into that time into
00:05:02 the mindset you are in because you have predicted the evolution of computing AI the internet technology in in the
00:05:11 decades that followed I was super fascinated by Silicon Valley which I seen on television once and thought my
00:05:17 god this is so cool they build like D Rams there and CPUs how cool is that and as a college students a few year later a
00:05:25 few days later I decided to be study intelligence and study human beings and found that even back then in the 80s and
00:05:31 90s that artificial intelligence is what fascinated me the most I was missing is that back in the day the computers are
00:05:38 really small they're like the brains you could build well not anywhere bigger as a cockroach and cock-horse aren't very
00:05:44 smart so we weren't at the scale yet where we are today did you dream at that time to achieve
00:05:51 the kind of scale we have today did that seem possible I always wanted to make robots smart I felt it was super cool to
00:05:58 build an artificial human and the best way to build not official you want to be a robot because that's kind of the
00:06:03 closest if you could do unfortunately we aren't there yet there were words today are still very brittle about as
00:06:09 fascinating to study intelligence from a constructive perspective it built something to understand you build what
00:06:16 do you think it takes to build an intelligent system and an intelligent robot I think the biggest innovation
00:06:23 that we've seen as machine learning and it's the idea that their computers can BC teach themselves
00:06:31 let's give an example I'd say everybody pretty much knows what a wok and we learn how to walk in the first year two
00:06:38 of our lives but no scientist has ever been able to write on the rules of human gait we don't understand that we can't
00:06:44 put we have in our brain somehow we can practice it we understand it that we can articulate that we can't pass it on by
00:06:51 language and that to me is kind of a deficiency of today's computer programming even you could program a
00:06:56 computer they're so insanely dumb that you have to give them rules for every contingencies very unlike the way people
00:07:03 learn but learn from data and experience computers are being instructed and because it's so hard to get this
00:07:08 instruction set right we pay software engineers two hundred thousand dollars a year now the most recent innovation
00:07:14 which has been to make for like 3040 years is an idea that computers can find their own rules so they can learn from
00:07:21 falling down and getting up the same way children can learn from falling down and getting up and that revolution has led
00:07:26 to a capability that's completely unmatched today's computers can watch experts do their jobs whether you're a
00:07:34 doctor or lawyer pick up the regularities learn those rules and then become as good as the best experts so
00:07:41 the dream of in the 80s of expert systems for example had at its core the idea that humans could boil down their
00:07:49 expertise on a sheet of paper so sort of reduce sort of be able to explain to machines how to do something explicitly
00:07:58 so do you think what's the use of human expertise into this whole picture do you think most of the intelligence will come
00:08:04 from machines learning from experience without human expertise input so the question for me is much more how to
00:08:11 express expertise you can express expertise providing a book you can express expertise by showing someone
00:08:16 what you're doing you can express expertise by applying it by by many different ways and I think the expert
00:08:23 systems was our best attempt in AI to capture expertise in rules there someone sat down and say here the rules of human
00:08:30 gait here's when you put your big toe forward and your heel backwards and Yahoo stop stumbling and as we now know
00:08:38 the set of rules a set of language that he can command is incredibly limited the human brain doesn't deal with
00:08:46 language it is with that subconscious numerical perceptual things that we don't even ever survey off
00:08:54 now when a AI system watches an expert do their job and practice their job it can pick up things that people can't
00:09:02 even put into writing into books or rules and that's where the real power is we now have AI systems that for example
00:09:09 look over the shoulders of highly paid human doctors like dermatologist or radiologists and they can somehow pick
00:09:16 up those skills that Noah can express in words so you were a key person in launching three revolutions online
00:09:25 education and Thomas vehicles and flying cars or vetoes so high level and I apologize for all the philosophical
00:09:37 questions that's no policy necessary how do you choose what problems to try and solve drives you to make those solutions
00:09:44 a reality I have two two desires in life I want to literally make the lives of others better or as few of them say
00:09:51 maybe joke indeed what make the world a better place if you believe in us it's as funny as it sounds and second I want
00:10:00 to learn I want to get in the circus I don't want to be in a dropping with it because if I meant job that I'm good at
00:10:05 the chance for me to learn something interesting is actually minimized so I want to be in a job I'm bad at that's
00:10:10 really important to me so I'm in a bill for example but people often call flying cars is that electrical vertical takeoff
00:10:18 and landing vehicles I'm just no expert in any of this and it's so much fun tool to learn on the job what actually means
00:10:25 to build something like this now it's saying that the stuff that I done lately after I finished my professorship at
00:10:32 Stanford the video focused on like what has the maximum impact on society like transportation is something has
00:10:39 transformed the 21st 20th century more than any other invention of my opinion even more than communication and cities
00:10:45 are different workers different women's rights are different because of transportation and yet we still have a
00:10:51 very suboptimal transportation solution where we kill 1.2 or so million P every year in traffic it's like the
00:10:59 leading cause of death for young people in many countries we have here extremely inefficient resource wise just go to
00:11:07 your average neighborhood city and look at the number of parked cars that's a travesty in my opinion or where we spend
00:11:14 endless hours in traffic jams and very very simple innovations like a self-driving car or what people call a
00:11:20 flying car could completely change this and it's there I mean the technology is it's basically there yet close your eyes
00:11:26 not to see it so lingering on autonomous vehicles fascinating space some incredible work
00:11:33 you done throughout your career there so let's start we'll start with DARPA I think the DARPA challenge there's a
00:11:42 desert and then urban to the streets I think that inspired an entire generation of roboticists and obviously sprung this
00:11:51 whole excitement about this particular kind of four wheeled robots were called autonomous cars self-driving cars so you
00:11:58 led the development of Stanley the autonomous car that one that erased the desert the DARPA challenge in 2005 and
00:12:07 junior a car that I finished second in the DARPA Grand Challenge also did incredibly well in 2007 I think what are
00:12:17 some painful inspiring or enlightening experiences from that time that stand out to you oh my god painful were all
00:12:28 these incredibly complicated stupid bugs that had to be found we had a face where the stanley hour or carded i eventually
00:12:37 won the DARPA Grand Challenge but every 30 miles just commit suicide and we didn't know why and it ended up to be
00:12:44 that in the sinking of two computer clocks occasionally a clock went backwards and that negative time elapsed
00:12:51 screwed up the entire internal logic but it took ages to find this they were like bugs like that I'd say enlightening is
00:13:00 the Stanford team immediately focused on machine learning and on software where's everybody else seem to focus on building
00:13:06 better hardware our knowledge had been you a human being with an existing rental car can
00:13:11 we drive the course I have to might have to build a better rental car I just built it should replace the human being
00:13:17 and the human being to me was a conjunction of three steps we had extensors eyes and ears
00:13:23 mostly eyes we had brains in the middle and then we had actuators our hands in our feet now the extras I used to build
00:13:29 the sensors like she also use it a bit what was missing was the brain so he had to build a human brain and nothing
00:13:35 nothing clear them to me that that the human brain is a learning machine so why not just train our robot so it you would
00:13:40 build a massive machine learning into our machine and with that were able to not just learn from human drivers we had
00:13:47 the entire speed control of the vehicle was copied from human driving but also have the robot learn from experience
00:13:52 where it made a mistake and go to recover from it and learn from it you mentioned the pain point of software and clocks
00:14:03 synchronization seems to seems to be a problem that continues with robotics it's a tricky one with drones and so on
00:14:12 Oh what what does it take to build a thing a system with so many constraints you have a deadline no time you're
00:14:22 unsure about anything really it's the first time that people really do even explore yeah it's not even sure that
00:14:27 anybody can finish when we were talking about the race of the desert the year before nobody finished what does it take
00:14:33 to scramble and finish a product that actually a system that actually works we were very lucky we did a small team that
00:14:40 core of the team of four people it was four because five couldn't comfortably sit inside carpet for food and I as a
00:14:47 team leader my job was to get pizza for everybody and wash the car and stuff like this and repair the radiator and it
00:14:55 broke and debug the system and we were a kind of open mind that we had like no egos involved in this you just wonder to
00:15:01 see how far we can get or we did really really well was time management we were done with everything a month before the
00:15:08 race and we froze the entire of a month before the race and it turned out looking at other teams every other team
00:15:13 complained if they just one more week they would have won and we decided that's gonna fall into a mistake you're
00:15:20 gonna be early and we had an entire month to shake that system and we actually found two or three minor
00:15:26 bugs in the last month that we had to fix and we were completely prepared in the race occurred okay so first of all
00:15:32 that's such an incredibly rare achievement in terms of being able to be done on time or ahead of time what do
00:15:42 you how do you do that in your future work what advice do you have in general because it seems to be so rare
00:15:48 especially in highly innovative projects like this people work till the last second but the nice thing about the
00:15:53 topic one challenge is that the problem was incredibly well-defined we were able for a while to drive the old topic van
00:15:59 challenge course which had been used the year before and then at some reason we were kicked out of the region so we had
00:16:05 to go to different desert the Sonoran Desert and be able to drive desert trails just at the same time so there
00:16:12 was never any debate about like what is actually the problem we didn't sit down and say hey should we build a car or a
00:16:18 plane if we had to build a car that made it very very easy then I studied my own life and life of a dozen guys that the
00:16:26 typical mistake that people make is that there's this kind of crazy bug left that they haven't found yet and and it's just
00:16:35 there regretted and it back would have been trivial to fix it was haven't fixed it yet they didn't want to fall into
00:16:41 that trap so I build a testing team we had a testing tena build a testing booklet of 160 pages of tests we had to
00:16:47 go through just to make sure we shake all the system appropriately Wow and the testing team was with us all the time
00:16:54 and dictated to us today we do railroad crossings tomorrow over do we practice the start of the event and in all of
00:17:01 these we thought oh my god has long solved trivial and I mean tested it out oh my god it doesn't were a well for us
00:17:06 and why not oh my god it mistakes the and the rails for metal barriers we have to fix this yes so it was easy a
00:17:15 continuous focus on improving the weakest part of the system and as long as you you focus on improving the
00:17:20 weakest part of the system you eventually build a really great system let me just pause Allah is to me as an
00:17:27 engineer is super-exciting that you were thinking like that especially at that stage as brilliant that testing was such
00:17:34 a core part of it it may be to linger on the point of leadership I think it's one of the first times you
00:17:42 were really a leader and you've led many very successful teams since then what does it take to be a good leader I would
00:17:53 say I'm most of all just take credit for the work of others right that's that's very convenient than that because I
00:18:00 can't do all the things myself I'm an engineer at heart so I I care about engineering so so I I don't know what
00:18:06 the chicken in the egg is but as a kid I love computers because you could tell them to do something and they actually
00:18:11 did it it was very cool and you could like in the middle of a night wake up at 1:00 in the morning and switch on your
00:18:16 computer and what you told you to yesterday I would still do that was really cool
00:18:20 unfortunately that it didn't quite work with people so you go to people and tell them what to do and they don't do it mm-hm
00:18:26 and they hate you for it or you do it today and then you go a day later and you stop doing it so you have to so then
00:18:31 a question really became how can you put yourself in the brain of the of people as opposed to computers and it has the
00:18:38 computers as super dumb then so dumb if if people were as dumb as computers i wouldnt want to walk with them mmm
00:18:42 but people are smart and people are emotional and people have pride and people have a spur a shion's so how can
00:18:50 i connect to that and that's the thing where most of leadership just fails because many many engineers turn manager
00:18:58 believe they can treat their team just the same way I can treat your computer and it just doesn't work this way it's
00:19:04 just really bad so how did how can i how are can i connect to people and in turns out as a college professor
00:19:09 the wonderful thing you do all the time is to empower other people like your job is to make your students look great
00:19:16 that's all you do you're the best coach and it turns out if you do a fantastic job is making a students look great they
00:19:22 actually love you and their parents love you and they give you all the credit for stuff you don't deserve since that all
00:19:27 my students who are smarter than me all the great stuff invented at Stanford versus their stuff not my stuff and they
00:19:32 give me credit and say oh Sebastian but just making them feel good about themselves so the question really is can
00:19:38 you take a team of people and what does it take to make them to connect to what they actually want in life and turn this
00:19:46 into product affection it turns out every human being that I know has incredibly good intention
00:19:51 I've really never really met a person with bad intentions I believe every person wants to contribute I think every
00:19:59 person I've met wants to help others it's amazing how much of a urge we have not to just help ourselves but to help
00:20:06 others so how can we empower people and give them the right framework that they can accomplish this if in moments when
00:20:14 it works it's magical because you'd see the confluence of people being able to make the world a better place
00:20:21 and driving enormous confidence and pride out of this and that's when when my environment works the best these are
00:20:29 moments where I can disappear for a month and come back and things still work it's very hard to accomplish but in
00:20:36 when it works is amazing so I agree very much it's not often heard that most people in the world have good intentions
00:20:45 at the core their intentions are good and they're good people that's a beautiful message it's not often heard
00:20:51 we make this mistake and this is a friend of mine eggs water token us that we we judge ourselves by our intentions
00:21:00 in others by the actions and I think the the biggest skill I mean here in Silicon Valley were full of Engineers I have
00:21:06 very little empathy and and I kind of befuddled why it doesn't work for them the biggest skill I think that that
00:21:13 people should acquire is to put themselves into the position of the other and listen and listen to what the
00:21:20 other has to say and they'd be shocked how similar they are to themselves and they might even be shocked how their own
00:21:28 actions don't reflect their intentions I often have conversations with engineers yes they look hey I love you doing a
00:21:35 great job and by the way what you just did has the following effect are you aware of that and then people would say
00:21:41 oh my god not I wasn't because my intention was that they'd say yeah I trust your intention you're a good human
00:21:47 being but just to help you in the future if you keep expressing it that way then people just hate you and I've had many
00:21:56 instances we say oh my god thank you for telling me this because it wasn't my intention to look like an idiot wasn't
00:22:00 my intention to help other people I just didn't know how to do it simply by the way there's a no-fail
00:22:09 carnegie 1936 how to make friends and how to influence others has the entire pipe or just read it and you're done and
00:22:14 usually apply it every day and I wish I could I was good enough to apply it every day but it says simple things
00:22:21 right like be positive remember previous name smile and eventually have empathy like really think that the person that
00:22:28 you hate and you think is an idiot is if you just like yourself it's a person who's struggling who means well and who
00:22:35 might need help and guess what you need help I've recently spoken with Stephen Schwarzman I'm not sure if you know who
00:22:45 that is but do so and he said I'm a list no but he he said sort of to expand on what you're saying that one of the
00:22:58 biggest things you can do is hear people when they tell you what their problem is and then help them with that problem
00:23:05 he says it's surprising how few people actually listen to what troubles others and because it's right there in front of
00:23:14 you and you can benefit the world the most and in fact yourself and everybody around you by just hearing the problems
00:23:21 and solving them I mean that's my my little history of engineering that is while I was engineering with computers I
00:23:30 didn't care all what the computers problems for just I just volumize everyone to do it and it doesn't work
00:23:39 with me you've become the mean say to do AI do the opposite but let's return to the comfortable world of engineering
00:23:49 thinking you can you tell me in broad strokes in how you see it because you're the course starting at the core of
00:23:56 driving it the technical evolution of autonomous vehicles from the first DARPA Grand Challenge to the incredible
00:24:03 success we see or the program you started with Google self-driving car and way more in the entire industry that
00:24:09 sprung up all the different kinds of approaches debates and so on well the idea of self-driving car goes back to
00:24:15 the 80s there was a team in Germany on the team at Carnegie Mellon that it's very pioneering work but back in the day
00:24:21 I'd say the computers were so efficient that even the best professors and engineers in the world basically stood
00:24:29 no chance it then folded into a phase where the US government spent at least half a million dollars that I could
00:24:36 count on research projects but the way the procurement works a successful stack of paper describing lots of stuff that
00:24:44 no one's ever gonna read was a successful product of a research project so so we trained our researchers to
00:24:53 produce lots of paper that all changed for the DARPA Grand Challenge and I really gotta credit the ingenious people
00:24:59 at DARPA and the US government in Congress that took a complete new funding model where they said that's not
00:25:05 fun effort let's fund outcomes and it sounds way trivial but it there was no tax code that allowed did the use of
00:25:13 congressional tax money for a price it was all effort based so if you put in a hundred dollars in you could charge 100
00:25:18 hours you put in a thousand dollars and you could build a thousand hours by shading the focus in city making the
00:25:23 price we don't pay you for development we pray for the accomplishment they drew in they automatically drew out
00:25:30 all these contractors who are used to the drug of getting money power and they drew in a whole bunch of new people and
00:25:37 these people are mostly crazy people there were people who had a car and a computer and they wanted to make a
00:25:43 million bucks the million bucks was the official price money was then doubled and they felt if I put my computer in my
00:25:51 car and program it I can be rich and it was so awesome like like half the team's there was a team that was surfer dudes
00:25:56 and they had like two surfers on the vehicle and brought like these fashion girls super cute girls like twin sisters
00:26:04 and and you could tell these guys were not your common I felt very offended who like gets all these big multi-million
00:26:11 and billion other countries from the US government and and there was a great we set the universities moved in I was very
00:26:20 fortunate at Stanford that I just received tenure so I couldn't be fired whenever I do otherwise I would have
00:26:26 done it and I had enough money to finance this thing and I was able to attract a lot of money from
00:26:31 from third parties and even car companies moved in they kind of moved in very quietly because they were super
00:26:37 scared to be embarrassed that they a car would flip over but Ford was there and Volkswagen was there and a few others
00:26:45 and GM was there so it kind of reset the entire landscape of people and if you look at who's a big name in suffering
00:26:50 cars today these were mostly people who participated in those challenges ok that's incredible can you just
00:26:58 comment quickly on your sense of lessons learned from that kind of funding model and the research that's going on
00:27:06 academia in terms of producing papers is there something to be learned and and scaled up bigger these having these
00:27:11 kinds of grand challenges that could improve outcomes so I'm a big believer in and focusing on kind of an end-to-end
00:27:21 system I'm a really big believer in an insistence building I've always built systems in my academic career even
00:27:26 though I love math and an abstract stuff but it's all derived from the idea of let's solve your problem and it's very
00:27:33 hard for me to be an academic and say let me solve a component of a problem like if someone this feels like
00:27:39 not monitoring logic or AI planning systems where people believe that a certain style of problem-solving
00:27:48 is the ultimate end objective and and I would always turn it around and say hey what problem put my grandmother care
00:27:54 about that doesn't understand computer technology and doesn't want to understand how could I make her love
00:27:59 what I do because only then do I have an impact on the world I can easily impress my colleagues
00:28:04 that's that's that that is much easier but impressing my grandmother is very very hard so I've always thought if I
00:28:11 can build a self-driving car and and my grandmother can use it even after she loses her driving privileges or Sheldon
00:28:19 can use it or we save maybe a million lives a year they would be very impressive and then there's so many
00:28:24 problems like these like there's a problem of curing cancer or I'll if twice as long once the problem is
00:28:30 defined of course I can solve it in society like it takes sometimes tens of thousands of people to to find a
00:28:36 solution there's no way you can fund an army of ten thousand at Stanford so you're going to be the prototype it's
00:28:42 bit of meaningful prototype and the DARPA Grand Challenge was beautiful because it told me what this
00:28:46 prototype had to do I didn't need to think about what it had to do it is said to read the rules and it was really
00:28:52 really beautiful and it's most beautiful you think what academia could aspire to is to build a prototype that's the
00:29:00 system's level that solves it gives you an inkling that this problem could be solved with this project that's all I
00:29:05 want to emphasize what academia really is and I think people misunderstand it first and foremost academia is a way to
00:29:14 educate young people first and foremost the professor is an educator no matter away what a small suburban college or
00:29:21 whether you are a Harvard or Stanford professor that's not the way most people think of themselves in academia because
00:29:28 we have this kind of competition going on for citations and and publication that's a measurable thing but that is
00:29:35 secondary to the primary purpose of educating people to think now in terms of research most of the great science
00:29:44 the great research comes out of universities you can trace almost everything back including Google to
00:29:50 universities so there's nothing we do fundamentally broken here it's a it's a good system and I think America has the
00:29:56 finest University system on the planet we can talk about reach and how to reach people outside the system it's a
00:30:02 different topic but the system would serve as a good system if I had one wish I would say it'd be really great if
00:30:12 there was more debate about what the great big problems are on the side and focus on those and most of them are
00:30:23 interdisciplinary unfortunately it's very easy to fall into a inner disciplinary viewpoint where your
00:30:31 problem is dictators but what your closest colleagues believe the problem is it's very hard to break out and say
00:30:36 why there's an entire new field of problems so give an example prior to me working on self-driving cars I was a
00:30:44 roboticist in a machine learning expert and I wrote books on robotics something called probabilistic robotics the survey
00:30:50 methods driven kind of viewpoint of the world I build robots that acted in museums as tour guides that bug let
00:30:56 children around it's something that it's time was moderately challenging when I started working on cars several
00:31:05 colleagues told me Sebastian you're destroying your career because in our field of robotics cars are looked like
00:31:11 as a gimmick and they're not expressive enough they can only push the throttle and and in the brakes there's no
00:31:18 dexterity there's no complexity it's just too simple and no one came to me and said Wow if you solve that problem
00:31:24 you can save a million lives right among all robotic problems that I've seen in my life I would say the self
00:31:30 having car transportation Havana has the most hope for society so how come the robotics community was all over the
00:31:36 place and of us become because we focused on methods and solutions and not on problems like if you go around today
00:31:43 and ask your grandmother what bugs you what really makes you upset I challenge any academic and to do this
00:31:51 and then realize how far your research is probably away from that today at the very least that's a good thing for
00:31:59 academics they deliberate on the other thing that's really nice in Silicon Valley is Silicon Valley is full of
00:32:04 smart people outside academia right so there's the Larry page's and magaz archive books in the world who are
00:32:09 anywhere as smart or smarter than the best academics I met in my life and what they do is they they are at a different
00:32:16 level they build the systems they build they build the customer-facing system they built things that people can use
00:32:24 without technical education and they are inspired by research they're inspired by scientist they hire the best PhDs from
00:32:32 the best universities for a reason so I think this kind of vertical integration that between the real product the real
00:32:38 impact and the real thought the real ideas there's actually working surprisingly balanced Silicon Valley it
00:32:44 did not work as well in other places in this nation so when I worked at Carnegie Mellon we had the world's finest
00:32:50 computer science university but there wasn't those people in Pittsburgh that would be able to take these very fine
00:32:56 computer science ideas and turn them into massive the impact for products that symbiosis seemed to exist pretty
00:33:04 much only in Silicon Valley and maybe a bit in Boston in Austin yeah with Stanford that's it was it's really
00:33:10 really interesting so if we look a little bit further on from the the DARPA Grand Challenge and
00:33:18 the launch of the Google self-driving car what do you see is the state the challenges of autonomous vehicles as
00:33:28 they are now is actually achieving that huge scale and having a huge impact on society I'm extremely proud of what what
00:33:35 has been accomplished and again I'm taking a lot of credit for the work for us and I'm actually very optimistic and
00:33:42 and people have been kind of worrying is it too fast as to slow I salute there yet and so on it is actually quite an
00:33:49 interesting hard problem and in that a self-driving car to build one that manages 90% of the problems encountered
00:33:57 in everyday driving is easy we can literally do this over a weekend to do 99% might take a month then there's 1%
00:34:05 left so 1% would mean that you still have a fatal accident every week very unacceptable so now you work on this 1%
00:34:13 and the 99% of there were any 1% is actually still a relatively easy but now you're down to like a hundredth of one
00:34:18 percent and it's still completely unacceptable in terms of safety so the variety of things you encounter are just
00:34:25 enormous and that gives me enormous respect for human being available to deal with the couch on the highway right
00:34:33 or the DNI headlight or the blown tire that we'd never never been trained for and all of a sudden I have to handle in
00:34:37 an emergency situation and often do very very successfully it's amazing from that perspective how safe driving
00:34:43 actually is given how many millions of miles we drive every year in this country we are now at a point where I
00:34:50 believed it in already is there and I've seen it I've seen it in way more I've seen it in activist engine crews and in
00:34:58 a number of companies in unvoyage where vehicles not driving around and basically flawlessly I able to drive
00:35:05 people around in limited scenarios in fact you can go to Vegas today and order a Seminole lift and if you got the right
00:35:14 setting off your app you'll be picked up by a driverless car now there's still safety drivers in there but that's a
00:35:21 fantastic way to kind of learn what the limits of Technology today and there's still some glitches
00:35:26 but the gifts have become very very rare I think the next step is gonna be to down cost it to harden it did that
00:35:34 entrapment it sends us are not quite an automatic weights than that yet and then you read about the business models to
00:35:39 really kind of go somewhere and make the business case and the business case is hard work it's not just oh my god we
00:35:45 have this capability people that's gonna buy it you have to make it affordable you have to give people that find the
00:35:52 social acceptance of people none of the teams yet has been able to or gutsy enough to drive around without a person
00:36:00 inside the car and that's that the next magical hurdle will be able to send these vehicles around completely empty
00:36:07 in traffic and I think I'm gonna wait everyday wait for the news that vamo has just done this so you know the
00:36:14 interesting you mentioned gutsy I mean let me ask some maybe unanswerable question may be edgy questions but in
00:36:27 terms of how much risk is required some guts in terms of leadership style it would be good to contrast approaches and
00:36:34 I don't think anyone knows what's right but if we compare Tesla and way mo for example Elon Musk and the way mo team
00:36:44 the there's slight differences in approach so on the Elon side there's more I don't know what the right word to
00:36:52 use but aggression in terms of innovation and I'm way mo side there's more sort of cautious safety focused
00:37:04 approach to the problem what do you think it takes what leadership at which moment is right which approach is right
00:37:13 look I'm I don't sit in either of those teams so I'm unable to even verify like somebody says correct right in the end
00:37:20 of the day every innovator in in that space will face a fundamental dilemma and I would say you could put aerospace
00:37:29 Titans into the same bucket yes which is you have to balance public safety with your drive to innovate and this country
00:37:37 in particular in states has a plus your history of doing this very successfully yet travel is what a
00:37:43 hundred times are safe per mile than ground travel and then cars and there's a reason for it because people have
00:37:52 found ways to be very methodological about ensuring public safety while still being able to make progress on important
00:38:00 aspects for example like yell and noise and fuel consumption so I think that those practices are pruned and they
00:38:09 actually work we live in a world safer than ever before and yes they will always be the provision that something
00:38:13 was wrong there's always the possibility that someone makes a mistake or there's an unexpected failure we can't never
00:38:20 guarantee to 100 percent absolute safety other than just not doing it but I think I'm very proud of the
00:38:27 history of of United States I mean we've we've dealt with much more dangerous technology like nuclear energy and kept
00:38:34 that safe too we have nuclear weapons and we keep those safe so so we have methods and procedures that really
00:38:41 balance these two things very very successfully you've mentioned a lot of great autonomous vehicle companies that
00:38:48 are taking sort of the level 4 level file they jump in full autonomy or the safety driver and take that kind of
00:38:54 approach and also through simulation and so on there's also the approach that Tesla autopilot is doing which is kind
00:39:02 of incrementally taking a level 2 vehicle and using machine learning and learning from the driving of human
00:39:10 beings and trying to creep up trying to incremental improve the system until it's able to achieve level 4 autonomy so
00:39:18 perfect autonomy in certain kind of geographical regions what are your thoughts on these contrasting approaches
00:39:24 when suppose of all I I'm a very proud Tesla and I literally used the autopilot every day and it literally has kept me
00:39:32 safe is a beautiful technology specifically for highway driving when I'm slightly tired because then it turns
00:39:42 me into a much safer driver and that I'm a hundred percent confident it's the case and tells us the right approach I think
00:39:50 that the biggest change I've seen since I went away one team is is this thing called deep learning deep learning was
00:39:56 was not a hot topic when I when I started way more or Google suffering cars it was there in fact we saw the
00:40:02 Google brain at the same time in Google X so I invested in deep learning but people didn't talk about it wasn't a hot
00:40:09 topic and nowadays there's a shift of emphasis from a more geometric perspective where you use geometric
00:40:15 sensors they give you a full 3d view when you do a geometric reasoning about all of this box over here might be a car
00:40:23 towards a more human like oh let's just learn about it this looks like the thing I've seen 10,000 times before so maybe
00:40:28 it's the same thing machine learning perspective and that has really put I think all these
00:40:36 approaches on steroids at Udacity we teach a course in self-driving cars we can in fact I think we'd be if credit is
00:40:44 over 20,000 or so people on self-driving car skills so every every self-driving car team in the world now uses our
00:40:50 engineers and in this course the very first homework assignment is to do Lane finding on images and lane finding
00:40:57 images for layman what this means is you you put a camera into your car or you open your eyes and even know where the
00:41:03 lane is right so so you can stay inside the lane with your car humans can do this super easily you just look and you
00:41:09 know where the line is just intuitively for machines for long term of a super heart because people would write these
00:41:15 kind of crazy rules if there's like vineland marcus and he's for fight really means this is not quite wide
00:41:20 enough so let's all it's not right or maybe the Sun is trying so when the Sun shines and this is right and this is a
00:41:25 straight line I missed quite a straight line because the ball is curved and and do we know that there's really six feet
00:41:30 between lane markings or not or 12 feet whatever it is and now the very students are doing they would take machine
00:41:38 learning so instead of like writing these crazy rules for the lane marker is they say let's take an hour driving and
00:41:44 label it and tell the vehicle this is actually the lane by hand and then these are examples and have the Machine find
00:41:50 its own rules but for lane markings are and within 24 hours now every student there's never done any programming for
00:41:57 in this space can write a perfect Lane finder as good as the best commercial line and that's completely amazing to me
00:42:04 we've seen progress using machine learning that completely Dwarfs anything that I saw ten years ago yeah and just
00:42:14 as a side note the self-driving car nanodegree the fact that you launch that many years ago now maybe four years ago
00:42:21 three years ago three years ago is incredible that it that's a great example of system level thinking sort of
00:42:27 just taking an entire course I teach each other solve entire problem I definitely recommend people it's been
00:42:33 super popular and it's become actually incredibly high quality we build it with Mercedes and and and various other
00:42:38 companies in that space and we find that engineers from Tesla and vamo are taking it today
00:42:45 the insight was that two things one is existing universities will be very slow to move because the departmental ice and
00:42:51 there's no department for self-driving cars so between Mickey and EE and computer science getting these folks
00:42:58 together into one room is really really hard and every professor listening he ever know that probably agree to that
00:43:05 and secondly even if if all the great universities just did this which none so far has develop a curriculum in this
00:43:12 field it is just a few thousand students they can partake because all the great universities are super selective so how
00:43:18 about people in India how about people in China or in the Middle East or Indonesia or Africa right should those
00:43:26 be excluded from the skill of building self-driving cars are there any dumber than we are any less privileged and the
00:43:33 answer is we should just give everybody the skill to build a self-driving car because if we do this then we have like
00:43:40 a thousand self-driving car startups and if 10 percent succeed that's like a hundred that means hundred countries now
00:43:45 we have self-driving cars and be safer it's kind of interesting to imagine impossible to qualify but the number the
00:43:54 you know over a period of several decades the impact that has like a single course like a ripple effect of
00:44:02 society if you just recently thought the Android and who was creator of cosmos show it's interesting to think about how
00:44:10 many scientists that show launched yes and so it's really in terms of impact I can't imagine a
00:44:18 better course than the self-driving car course that's you know the there's other more specific disciplines like deep
00:44:23 learning and so on that Udacity is also teaching but self-driving cars it's really really interesting course yeah
00:44:28 and it came at the right moment it came at a time when there were a bunch of aqua huggers aqua hire as a acquisition
00:44:35 of a company not for its technology or its products or business but for its people so aqua hire means maybe the company of
00:44:41 70 people they have no product yet but they're super smart people and he pays certain amount of money so I took back
00:44:47 the highest like GM Cruise and uber and and others and did the math and said hey how many people are there and how much
00:44:55 money was paid and as a lower bound is tomato value of an self-driving car engineer in these acquisitions to be at
00:45:02 least 10 million dollars right so think about this you you get just have a skill and you team up and build a company and
00:45:09 you're worth now is 10 million dollars I mean it's kind of cool I mean but what other thing could you do in life to be
00:45:15 worth 10 million dollars within a year yeah amazing but to come back for a moment on to deep learning and its
00:45:24 application in autonomous vehicles you know what are your thoughts on Elon Musk's statement provocative statement
00:45:31 perhaps that lighter is a crutch so this geometric way of thinking about the world maybe holding us back if what we
00:45:39 should instead be doing in this robotics but in this particular space of autonomous vehicles is using camera as a
00:45:47 primary sensor and using computer vision or machine learning is the primary way to look up to Commons I think first of
00:45:54 all we all know that people can drive cars without light us in their hands because we only have eyes and we most
00:46:02 you just use eyes for driving maybe we use some other perception about our bodies accelerations occasionally our
00:46:11 years certainly not our noses so that the existence proof is there that eyes must be sufficient in fact we could even
00:46:19 drive a car someone put a camera out and then give us the camera image with known agency you would be able to drive a car
00:46:27 and that way it the same way so cameras sufficient secondly I really love the idea that in in the Western world we
00:46:33 have many many different people trying different hypotheses it's almost like an anthill like if another Idol tries to
00:46:40 forage for food but you can sit there as two ands and agree what the perfect path is and then every single ant marches for
00:46:46 the most like the location of food is or you can even just spread out and I promise you the spread out solution will
00:46:52 be better because if the discussing philosophical intellectual ends get it wrong and they're all moving the wrong
00:46:58 direction they're gonna waste a day and then you're gonna discuss again for another week
00:47:02 whereas if all these ants go in a random direction someone's gonna succeed and you're gonna come back and claim victory
00:47:07 and get the Nobel Prize about everything antipholus and then they'll march in the same direction and that's great about
00:47:12 society that's great about the Western society if you're not plant-based you're not central base we don't have a Soviet
00:47:19 Union style central government that tells us where to forge we just Forge we start and seek or you get investor money
00:47:26 and go out and try it out and who knows is gonna win I like it in your when you look at the long term vision of
00:47:34 autonomous vehicles do you see machine learning as fundamentally being able to solve most
00:47:40 of the problems so learning from experience I'd say we should be very clear about what machine learning is and
00:47:46 is not and I think there's a lot of confusion for this today is a technology that can go through large databases of
00:47:59 repetitive patterns and find those patterns so in example we did a study at stand for two years ago where we applied
00:48:06 machine learning to detecting skin cancer and images and we harvested or built a data set of 129,000 skin photo
00:48:16 shots that were all had been biopsied for what the actual situation was and those included melanomas and carcinomas
00:48:25 also included rashes and other skin conditions lesions and then we had a network find those patterns and it was
00:48:33 by and large able to then detect skin cancer with an iPhone as accurately as the best board-certified Stanford level dermatologist
00:48:44 we proved that now not this thing was great in this one thing I'm finding skin cancer but it couldn't drive a car so so
00:48:51 the difference to human intelligence as we do all these many many things and we can often learn from a very small data
00:48:59 set of experiences but as machines still need very large data sets and things should be very repetitive no that's
00:49:05 still super impactful because almost everything we do is repetitive so that's gonna we transform human labor but it's
00:49:13 not this almighty general intelligence we're really far away from a system that will exhibit general intelligence to
00:49:20 that end I actually commiserate the naming a little bit because artificial intelligence if you believe Hollywood is
00:49:26 immediately mixed into the idea of human suppression and and machine superiority I don't think that we don't see this in
00:49:33 my lifetime I don't think human suppression is a good idea I don't see it coming I don't see the technology
00:49:41 being there what I see instead is a very pointed focused pattern recognition technology that's able to extract
00:49:48 patterns relation large data sets and in doing so it can be super impactful and super impactful let's take the impact of
00:49:57 artificial terrorism on human work we all know that it takes something like 10,000 hours to become an expert if
00:50:04 you're gonna be a doctor or lawyer or even a really good driver it takes a certain amount of time to become experts
00:50:11 machines now are able and have been shown to observe people become experts in observe experts and then extract
00:50:18 those rules from experts in some interesting way they could go from law to sales to driving cars to diagnosing
00:50:30 cancer and then giving that capability to people who are completely new in their job we now can and that's that's
00:50:36 been done has been done commercially in many many instances that means we can use machine learning to make people an
00:50:44 expert on the very first day of their work like think about the impact if if your doctor is still in the first 10,000
00:50:52 hours you have a doctor who's not quite an expert yet who would not want the doctor who is the
00:50:57 world's best expert and now we can leverage machines to really eradicate the error and decision making error and
00:51:06 lack of expertise for human doctors they could save your life if we can link on that for a little bit
00:51:12 in which way do you hope machines in the medical in the medical field could help assist doctors you mentioned this sort
00:51:21 of accelerating the learning curve or people if they start a job or in the first 10,000 hours can be assisted by a
00:51:28 machine how do you how do you envision that assistance looking so we built this this app for an iPhone that can detect
00:51:35 and classify and diagnose skin cancer and we proved two years ago there is as pretty much as good or better than the
00:51:43 best human doctor so let me give his story so there's a friend of mine is calling Ben Ben is a very famous venture
00:51:49 capitalist he goes to his doctor and the doctor looks at a mall and and says hey that mole is probably harmless and for
00:51:59 some very funny reason he pulls out that phone with our app he's a collaborator in our study and the app says no no no
00:52:06 this is a melanoma and and for background melanomas are skin cancers the most common cancer in this country
00:52:15 melanomas can go from from stage zero to Stage four within less than a year stage zero means you can basically cut it all
00:52:22 yourself with better kitchen knife and be safe and Stage four means your chances of leading from five more years
00:52:29 in less than 20% so it's a very serious serious serious condition so this doctor who took out the iPhone looked at the
00:52:38 iPhone was a little bit puzzled Samina but just to be safe let's cut it out and biopsy it that's that the technical term
00:52:44 for let's get an in-depth diagnostics that is more than just looking at it and it came back as cancerous as a melanoma
00:52:53 and it was then removed and my friend Ben I was hiking with him and we are talking about a I in and said I turn
00:52:59 into this vote on skin cancer he's so funny my doctor just had an iPhone that found my cancer so I was a completely in
00:53:07 tree didn't even know about so here's a person I mean this is a real human life right now who doesn't know
00:53:13 somebody who's been affected by cancer cancer is cause of death number two cancer is this kind of disease that that
00:53:21 is mean in in the following way most cancers can actually be cured relatively easily if we catch them early and and
00:53:27 the reason why we don't tend to catch them early is because they have no symptoms like your very first symptom of
00:53:34 a gallbladder cancer or a pancreatic cancer might be a headache and when you finally go to your doctor because of
00:53:41 these headaches or your back pain and you're being imaged it's usually stage four plus and that's the time when the
00:53:49 your curing chances might be dropped to a single-digit percentage so if we could leverage the eye to inspect your body on
00:53:57 a regular basis without even a doctor in the room maybe when you take a shower over have you I know this sounds creepy
00:54:03 but then we might be able to save you've mentioned there's a concern that people have about near-term impacts of
00:54:13 AI in terms of job loss so you've mentioned being able to assist doctors being able to assist people in their
00:54:19 jobs do you have a worry of people losing their jobs or the economy being affected by the improvements in AI
00:54:27 anybody concern about job losses please come to get a sitcom we teach contemporary tech skills and we
00:54:36 have a kind of implicit job promise we often when when we measure we spend way over 50% of our graders in new jobs
00:54:43 they're very satisfied about it and it costs almost nothing cost like a thousand five hundred max or something
00:54:48 like that and so there's a cool new program they agree with the US government guaranteeing that you will
00:54:55 help us give scholarships that educate people and in this kind of situation you're working with the US government on
00:55:02 the idea of basically building the American dream so Udacity has just dedicated one hundred thousand
00:55:10 scholarships for citizens of America for various levels of courses that eventually will get you a job and those
00:55:18 courses all somewhat relate with the tech sector because the tech sector is kind of the hottest sector right now and
00:55:24 they range from in two level digital marketing to very advanced self driving car engineering and we're doing this
00:55:30 with the white house because II think is bipartisan it's an issue that is that if you want to really make America great
00:55:39 being able to be a part of the solution and live the American dream requires us to be proactive about our education and
00:55:46 our skill set it's just the way it is today and it's always been this way I've always had this American dream to send
00:55:52 our kids to college and now the American dream has to be to send ourselves to college into this very vey vey
00:56:00 efficiently and very way we can squeeze in and evenings and things to online or at all ages all ages so our our learners
00:56:12 go from age 11 to age 80 I just travel Germany and and the guy in train compartment next to me was my students
00:56:19 wow that's amazing I don't think about impact we've become the educator of
00:56:25 choice for now I believe officially six countries or five countries is most in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia and in
00:56:31 Egypt in Egypt we just had a cohort graduate where we had 1100 high school students that went through
00:56:40 programming skills proficient at the level of computer science undergrad and we had a 95% graduation rate even though
00:56:46 everything's online it's kind of tough but we kind of trying to figure out how to make this effective the vision is the
00:56:52 vision is very very simple the vision is education ought to be a basic human right it cannot be locked up
00:57:02 behind ivory tower walls only for the rich people for the parents who might be bright themself into the system and only
00:57:09 for young people and only for people from the right demographics literate geography and possibly even the right
00:57:15 race it has to be opened up to everybody if we if we are truthful to the human mission via truthful to our values we
00:57:22 gonna open up education to everybody in the world so Udacity is pledge of a hundred
00:57:27 thousand scholarships I think it's the biggest pleasure of scholarships ever in terms of the numbers and we've working
00:57:33 as I said for the White House and with very accomplished CEOs like Tim Cook from Apple and others to really bring
00:57:41 education to everywhere in the world not to ask if you pick the favorite of your children but at this podium Jasper no
00:57:54 okay good in this particular moment what nanodegree what said of course is are you most excited about Udacity or is
00:58:02 that too impossible to pick I've been super excited about something we haven't launched yet in the building which is
00:58:09 when we talk to our partner companies we have known a very strong footing in the enterprise world and also to our
00:58:16 students we've kind of always focused on these hard skills like the programming skills or math skills or building skills
00:58:23 or design skills and a very common task is soft skills like how do you behave in your work how you develop empathy how do
00:58:31 you work in a team what are the very basics of management how do you do time management how do you advance your career in the
00:58:38 context of a broader community and that's something that we haven't done very valid audacity and I would say most
00:58:45 universities doing very poorly as well because we're so obsessed with individual test scores and and so little
00:58:51 pace a little attention to teamwork in education so that's something I see us moving into as a company because I'm
00:58:58 excited about this and I think look we can teach people tech skills and they're going to be great but if you teach
00:59:03 people empathy that's gonna have the same impact may be harder than self-driving cars but I don't think so I
00:59:11 think the rules are really simple you just have to you have to you have to want to engage it's it's via we
00:59:17 literally went in in school and in k-12 we teach kids like get the highest math score and if you are a rational human
00:59:24 being you might evolved from this education say having the best math score and the best English scores make me the
00:59:30 best leader and it turns out not to be the case it's actually really wrong because
00:59:35 making first of all in terms of math scores I think is perfectly fine to hire somebody with great math skills you'd
00:59:41 have to do yourself you can't hire some of the good empathy for you that's much harder but it can always hire some with
00:59:47 great math skills but we live in in affluent world where we constantly deal with other people and it's a beauty it's
00:59:53 not a nuisance it's a beauty so if we somehow develop that muscle that we can do that well and empower others in the
01:00:01 workplace I think you're gonna be super successful and I know many fellow roboticists and computer scientists that
01:00:12 I will assist take this course not to be named many many years ago 1903 the Wright brothers flew in Kitty Hawk for
01:00:23 the first time and you've watched a company of the same name Kitty Hawk with the dream of building flying cars evey
01:00:34 tall's so at the big picture what are the big challenges of making this thing that actually inspired generations of
01:00:41 people about what the future looks like what does it take one of the biggest challenges so so flying cars has always
01:00:47 been a dream of boy every girl wants to fly let's be honest yes and let's go back in on
01:00:53 history of you're dreaming of flying I think my answer my single most remembered childhood dream has been a
01:00:59 dream where I was sitting on a pillow and I could fly I was like five years old I remember like maybe three dreams
01:01:04 are much higher but that's the one that we remember most vividly and then Peter Thiel famously said they promise us
01:01:11 flying cars and they give us 140 characters pointing as Twitter at the time limiting message size 240
01:01:19 characters so if you're coming back now to really go for this super impactful stuff like flying cars and to be precise
01:01:26 they're not really cars they don't have wheels they actually much closer to a helicopter than anything else they take
01:01:31 off vertically in the fly horizontally but they have important differences one difference is that they are much quieter
01:01:39 if you just released a vehicle called project heavy side they can fly over you as low as a helicopter and you basically
01:01:46 can't hear it's like 38 decibels it's like like that if you were inside a library you might be able to hear it but
01:01:52 anywhere outdoors your ambient noise is higher secondly they're they're much more affordable they're much more
01:01:59 affordable than helicopters and the reason is helicopters are expensive for many reasons there's lots of single
01:02:07 point of figures in a helicopter there's a bolt between the blades that's cause Jesus fault and the reason
01:02:12 why it's called Jesus board is it that if this boat breaks you will die there is no second solution in helicopter
01:02:20 flight whereas we have these distributed mechanism when you go from gasoline to electric you can now have many many many
01:02:26 small motors as opposed to one big motor and that means if you lose one of those motors not a big deal
01:02:31 heavy side if it loses a motor has eight of those you lose one of those eight motors so it's seven left you can take
01:02:38 off just like before and land just like before we are now also moving into a technology it doesn't require a
01:02:45 commercial pilot because in some level flight is actually easier than than ground transportation like in
01:02:52 self-driving cars oh the world is full of like children and bicycles and other cars and mailboxes and curbs and shrubs
01:02:59 and what-have-you all these things you have to avoid when you go above buildings and tree lines there's nothing
01:03:05 there I mean you can do the test right now look outside and count the number of things you see flying I'd be shocked if
01:03:11 you could see more than two things it's probably just zero in the Bay Area the most I've ever seen was six and maybe
01:03:20 it's 15 or 20 but not ten thousand so the sky is very ample and very empty and very free so the vision is can be built
01:03:28 a socially acceptable mass transit transit solution for daily transportation that is affordable and we
01:03:37 have an existence proof Heaviside can fly a hundred miles in range with still 30% electric reserves it can fly up to
01:03:45 like a hundred and eighty miles an hour we know that that solution that scale would make your ground transportation 10
01:03:55 times as fast as a car based on use census data which means we would take your 300 hours of day of yearly commute
01:04:04 down to 30 hours and giving 270 hours back who wouldn't want I mean who doesn't hate traffic
01:04:09 like I hate give me the person that doesn't hate traffic I hate traffic every day every time I want traffic I
01:04:13 hate it and and if we could free the world from traffic we have technology we can free
01:04:20 the world from traffic yeah we have the technology it's there we have an existence proof test it's not a
01:04:25 technological problem anymore do you think there is a future where tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of
01:04:36 both delivery drones and flying cars of this kind a VTOL fill the sky i absolutely believe this and there's
01:04:43 obviously the societal acceptance is a major question and of course safety as I believe in and safety of you exceed
01:04:50 ground transportation safety as has happened for aviation already commercial aviation and in terms of acceptance I
01:04:57 think one of the key things is noise that's why we are focusing relentlessly on noise and we bid perhaps the crisis
01:05:07 electric VTOL vehicle ever built the nice thing about the sky is three-dimensional so so any
01:05:12 mathematician will immediately recognize the difference between 1d of a lack of regular highway to
01:05:18 three of a sky but to make it clear for the layman say you want to make a hundred vertical lanes of highway 101 in
01:05:25 San Francisco because you believe building a health and vertical lanes is the right solution imagine how much it
01:05:31 would cost to stack a hundred vertical lanes physically onto 101 there would be prohibitive that would be consuming the
01:05:38 world's GDP for an entire year just for one highway it's amazing expensive again in the sky
01:05:43 it would just be a recompilation of a piece of software because all these lanes are virtual that means any vehicle
01:05:49 that is in conflict with another vehicle would just go to different altitudes and then the conflict is gone and if you
01:05:56 don't believe this that's exactly how how commercial aviation works when you fly from New York to San Francisco
01:06:03 another plane flies from Sanford to New York there are different altitudes so they don't hit each other it's a soft
01:06:10 problem for the jet space and it will be a soft problem for the urban space there's companies like Google Bing and
01:06:16 Amazon working on very innovative solutions how do a space management use exactly the same principles as we use
01:06:23 today throughout today's dance there's nothing hard about this do you envision autonomy being a key part of it so that
01:06:34 that the flying vehicles are either semi autonomous or fully autonomous a hundred percent autonomous you don't want idiots
01:06:41 like me flying in the sky I promise you and if you have ten thousand what's the movie The Fifth Element to get a thief
01:06:49 over to happen if it's not autonomous in a centralized that's a really interesting idea of a centralized sort
01:06:56 of management system for lanes and so on so actually just being able to have similar as we have in the current
01:07:03 commercial aviation but scale it up to which much more vehicles a really interesting optimization problem it is
01:07:09 vey mathematically very very straightforward like the gap we leave between jets is Gargantuas and part of
01:07:15 the reason is there isn't that many gents so this feels like a good solution today when you get vectored by a traffic
01:07:24 control someone talks to you right so any ATC controller might have up to maybe 20 planes on the same frequency
01:07:28 and then talk to you have to talk back and it feels right because there isn't more
01:07:33 than 20 pins around any hours so you can talk to everybody but if there's 20,000 things around he can't talk to everybody
01:07:38 anymore so we have to do something that's called digital like text messaging like we do have solutions like
01:07:44 we have about four or five billion smartphones in the world now all right and they all connected and some of you
01:07:50 solved the scale problem for smart phones we know where they all are they can talk to somebody and they're very
01:07:56 reliable they amazingly reliable we could use the same system the same scale for air traffic control so instead of me
01:08:04 as a pilot talking to a human being and in the middle of the conversation receiving a new frequency like how
01:08:10 ancient is that we could digitize the stuff and and digitally transmitted the right flight coordinates and that
01:08:18 solution will automatic a laugh to 10,000 vehicles we talked about empathy a little bit do you think we'll one day
01:08:26 build an air a eye system that a human being can love and that loves that human back like in the movie her look I'm I'm
01:08:35 a pragmatist for me a is a is a tool it's like a shovel and the ethics of using the shovel I always with us the
01:08:43 people and and there has to be this way in terms of emotions I would hate to come into my kitchen and see that my
01:08:54 refrigerator spoiled all my food then have it explained to me that it fell in love with a dishwasher and I wasn't as
01:09:00 nice the dishwasher so as a result it neglected me there would just be a bad experience and it would be a bad product
01:09:09 I would probably not recommend this for frigerator to my friends and that's where I draw the line I think to me
01:09:16 technology has to be reliable it has to be predictable I want my car to work I don't want to fall in love with my car I
01:09:25 just wanted to work I wanted to compliment me not to replace me I have very unique human properties and
01:09:33 I want the machines to make me turn me into a superhuman like I'm already a superhuman today thanks to the machines
01:09:40 that surround me and give you examples I can run across the Atlantic at near the speed of sound at 36,000 feet today
01:09:51 that's kind of amazing I can my voice now carries me all the way to Australia using a smartphone today and it's not
01:09:58 not the speed of sound which would take hours it's the speed of light my voice travels at the speed of light how cool
01:10:06 is that that makes me superhuman I would even argue my my flushing toilet makes me superhuman just think of the time
01:10:14 before flushing toilets and and maybe you have a veiled person in your family that you can ask about this or take a
01:10:22 trip to rural India until experience it it's it's it makes me superhuman so to me what technology does it complements
01:10:30 me it makes me stronger therefore words like love and compassion have very little a very little interest
01:10:38 in this for machines I have interested men people you don't think first of all beautifully put
01:10:46 beautifully argued but do you think love has use in our tools compassion I think laughs is a beautiful human
01:10:54 concept and if you think what love really is love is a means to convey safety to convey trust I think Trust has
01:11:07 a huge need in technology as well much as people we want to trust our technology the same way we - or in
01:11:16 similar way we trust people in in human interaction standards have emerged and and feelings emotions have emerged may
01:11:24 be genetically may be very largely that I able to convey sense of trust sense of safety sense of passion of love of
01:11:30 dedication that that makes the human fabric and I'm a big slacker for love I want to be laughter I want to be trusted
01:11:37 ever me admired all these wonderful things and because all of us who we have this beautiful system I wouldn't just
01:11:45 blindly copy this to the machines here's why when you look at say transportation you could have observed that up to the
01:11:54 end of the 19th century so transportation used any number of legs from one leg to two legs to a
01:12:02 thousand legs and you could have concluded that is the right way to move about the environment we've been made
01:12:08 exceptional birds who is flapping wings in fact there are many people in aviation that flap wings to the arms and
01:12:14 jump from Cliffs most of them didn't survive then then the interesting thing is that the technology solutions are
01:12:22 very different like in technologies really easily by the wheel in biology is super hard ability there's very few
01:12:29 perpetually rotating things in in in biology and everyone sells things in in engineering we can build wheels and
01:12:41 those wheels gave rise to cars similar wheels gave rides to to aviation like there's no thing there flies there
01:12:48 wouldn't have something rotates like a jet engine or helicopter blades so the solutions have used very different
01:12:57 physical laws in nature and that's great so for me to be too much focused on oh this is how nature does it this is
01:13:04 replicated if we really believed that the solution to the irish revolution was a humanoid robot it would still be
01:13:12 waiting today again beautifully put you said that you don't take yourself too seriously you just say that i mean
01:13:19 you want you to say that maybe you don't take me seriously I'm not yeah you're right I don't wanna I just made that up
01:13:27 but you know you have a humor and a lightness about life that I think is it is beautiful and inspiring to a lot of
01:13:35 people where does that come from the smile the humor the lightness amidst all the chaos of the hard work that you and
01:13:44 where does that come from I just love my life I love I love the people around me I love I'm just so glad to be alive like
01:13:54 I'm about 52 how to believe people say 5251 so now feel better but in in in in in looking around the world looking just
01:14:06 go back 200 300 years like Humanity is what 300 thousand years old but for the first 300,000 years - the
01:14:15 last 100 our life expectancy would have been plus or minus 30 years roughly give or take so I would be long dead now like
01:14:25 that makes me just enjoy every single day of my life because I don't deserve this like why am i porn today when so
01:14:33 many of my interest has died of horrible deaths like famines massive wars that ravaged Europe for the last 1000 years
01:14:44 mostly disappeared after World War 2 when the Americans and the Allies did something amazing to my country that
01:14:49 didn't deserve it my country of Germany it was so amazing and then when you when you're live and
01:14:58 feel this every day then it is so amazing what what we can accomplish what we can do we live in the world that is so
01:15:07 incredibly vastly changing every day almost everything that we cherish from your smartphone to your flushing toilet
01:15:16 to all these basic inventions your new clothes you're wearing your watch your plain penicillin and no anesthesia for
01:15:27 surgery penicillin have been invented in the last 150 years so in the last 150 years something magical happened and I
01:15:34 would trace it back to Gutenberg and the printing press that has been able to disseminate information more efficiently
01:15:40 than before that all of a sudden they're able to invent agriculture and nitrogen fertilization that made agriculture so
01:15:47 much more potent that we didn't if you focus of hams anymore and you could start reading and writing and we could
01:15:52 become all these wonderful things we are today for me LM pilot - massage therapist - software engineer this is
01:15:59 amazing like living in that time is such a blessing we should sometimes really think about
01:16:06 this Steven Pinker who as a very famous author and philosopher whom I really adore wrote a great book called
01:16:10 enlightenment now and that's maybe the one book I would recommend and he asked the question if there was only a single
01:16:16 article written in the 20th century don't leave an article but would it be what's the most important innovation the
01:16:22 most important thing that and he would say this article would credit a guy named Carl Bosch and I
01:16:29 challenge anybody have you ever heard of the name Carl Bosch I hadn't okay there's a there's a Bosch corporation in
01:16:36 Germany but it's not associated with Carl Bosch so I looked it up kibosh invented nitrogen fertilization
01:16:45 and in doing so together with an older invention of irrigation was able to increase the yield Ferrari cultural land
01:16:53 by a factor of twenty six so a two thousand five hundred percent increase in infertility of land and that so Steve
01:17:02 Pinker argues saved over two billion lives today two billion people who would be dead if this man hadn't done what he
01:17:09 had done okay think about that impact and what that means to society that's that's the way I look at the world
01:17:16 I mean it's so amazing to be a life and be part of this and I'm so glad I lived after Cobb abortion not before I don't
01:17:23 think there's a better way to end it Sebastian it's an honor to talk to you to have had the chance to learn from you
