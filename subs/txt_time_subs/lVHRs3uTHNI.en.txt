00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Paulo Lara Lara she's a professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at
00:00:08 Harvard University and is interested in understanding the molecular laws that govern the birth differentiation and
00:00:15 assembly of the human brains cerebral cortex she explores the complexity of the brain by studying and engineering
00:00:23 elements of how the brain develops this was a fascinating conversation to me it's part of the artificial intelligence

00:00:51 love truth good three beautiful words your support means a lot and inspires me to keep the series going and now here's
00:01:02 my conversation with Paola our Lada you studied the development of the human brain for many years so let me ask you
00:01:11 and out-of-the-box question first how likely is it that there's intelligent life out there in the universe outside
00:01:18 of Earth with something like the human brain so I could put it another way how unlikely is the human brain how
00:01:28 difficult is it to build a thing through the evolutionary process well it has happened here I on this planet once yes
00:01:38 once so that simply tells you that it could of course happen again other places is only a matter of probability
00:01:45 what the probability that you would get a brain like the ones that we have like like the human brain so how difficult is
00:01:54 it to make the human brain it's pretty difficult but most importantly I guess we know very little about how this
00:02:05 process really happens and there is a reason for that actually multiple reasons for that most of what we know
00:02:13 about how the mammalian brain so the brain of mammals developed comes from studying in labs other brains not our
00:02:22 own brain the brain of mice for example but if I showed you a picture of a mouse brain and then you put it next to a
00:02:28 picture of a human brain they don't look at all like each other so they're very different and and therefore there is a
00:02:36 limit to what you can learn about how the human brain is made by studying the mouse brain the region there is a huge
00:02:43 value and studying the mouse brain there are many things that we have learned but it's not the same thing
00:02:48 so in having studied the human brain or through the mouse and through other methodologies that we'll talk about do
00:02:55 you have a sense I mean you're one of the experts in the world how much do you feel you know about the brain and how
00:03:05 much how often do you find yourself in awe of this mysterious thing yeah you pretty much find yourself you know all
00:03:15 the time it's an amazing process it's a process which by means that we don't fully understand at the very beginning of embryogenesis
00:03:25 the structure called the neural tube literally self-assembles and it happens in an embryo and it can happen also from
00:03:35 stem cells in a dish okay and then from there these stem cells that are present within the neural tube give rise to all
00:03:42 of the thousands and thousands of different cell types per present in the brain through time right with the
00:03:51 interesting very intriguing interesting observation is that the time that it takes for the human brain to be made
00:04:01 it's human time meaning that for me and you it took almost nine months of gestation to build the brain and then
00:04:07 another twenty years of learning postnatally to get the brain we have today that allows us to this
00:04:14 conversation a mouse takes twenty days or so too small for an embryo to be born and so and and so the brain is built in
00:04:23 a much shorter period of time and the beauty of it is that if you take mouse stem cells and you put them in and
00:04:31 culture - the brain the orbit the brain organoid that you get from a mouse is formed faster that if you took human
00:04:38 stem cells and put them in the dish and let them make a human brain organoid so the very developmental process is
00:04:48 controlled by the speed of the species which means it's by its own purpose it's not accidental or there is something in
00:05:00 that temporal it's very exactly that is very important for us to get the brain we have and we can speculate for why
00:05:09 that is you know it takes us a long time as as human beings after we're born to learn all the things that we have to
00:05:18 learn to have the adult brain it's actually 20 years think about it from when a baby is born or - when a teenager
00:05:26 goes through puberty to adults it's a long time do you think you can maybe talk through
00:05:34 the first few months and then on to the first 20 years and then for the rest of their lives
00:05:39 what is the development of the human brain look like what are the different stages at the beginning you have to
00:05:47 build a brain right and the brain is made of cells what's the very beginning which beginning I were talking in the
00:05:55 embryo as the embryo is developing in the womb in addition to making all of the other tissues of the embryo the
00:06:02 muscle the heart the blood the embryo is also building the brain and it builds from a very simple structure called the
00:06:11 neural tube which is basically nothing but a cube of cells that spans sort of the length of the embryo from the head
00:06:19 all the way to the tail let's say of the embryo and then over in human means over many months of gestation from that
00:06:29 neural tube which contains stem cell-like cells of the brain you will make many many other building blocks of
00:06:39 the brain so all of the other cell types there are many many different types of cells in the brain that will form
00:06:46 specific structures of the brain so you can think about embryonic development of the brain is just the time in which you
00:06:53 are making the building blocks the cells at the stem cells relatively homogeneous like uniform or they all different ok
00:07:01 good question it's exactly how it works you start with a more homogeneous perhaps more multipotent type of stem
00:07:11 cell that most importantly means that it can it has the potential to make many many different types of other cells and
00:07:20 then with time these progenitors become more heterogeneous which means more diverse there are going to be many
00:07:26 different types of the stem cells and also they will give rise to progeny to other cells that are not themselves that
00:07:33 are specific cells of the brain that are very different from the mothers themselves and now you think about this
00:07:39 process of making cells from the stem cells over many many months of development for humans and
00:07:45 and what you're doing you're building the cells they physically make the brain and then you arrange them in specific
00:07:54 structures that are present in the final brain so you can think about the embryonic development of the brain as
00:08:01 the time where you're building the bricks you're putting a bricks together to form buildings structures regions of
00:08:09 the brain and where you make the connections between these many different type of cells especially nerve cells
00:08:17 neurons right that transmit action potentials and electricity I've heard you also says somewhere I think correct
00:08:23 me if I'm wrong that the order of the way this builds matters oh yes if you are an engineer and you think about
00:08:31 development you can think of it as well I could also take all the cells and bring them all together into a brain in
00:08:39 the end but development is much more than that so the cells are made in a very specific order that subserve the
00:08:47 final product that you need to get and so for example all of the nerve cells the neurons are made first and all of
00:08:54 the supportive cells of the neurons like the glia is made later and there is a reason for that because they have to
00:09:02 assemble together in specific ways but you also may say well why don't we just put them all together in the end it's
00:09:08 because as they develop next to each other they influence their own development so it's a different thing
00:09:14 for a glia to be made alone in a dish then a glia be made in a glial cell be made in a developing embryo with all
00:09:21 these other cells surrounded they produce all these other signals first of all that's mind-blowing that this
00:09:28 development process from my perspective in artificial intelligence you often think of how incredible the final
00:09:34 product is the final product the brain but you just you're making me realize that the final product is just is the
00:09:42 the beautiful thing is the actual development and development process do we know the code that drives that development
00:09:54 do we have any sense first of all thank you for saying that it's really the formation of the brain
00:10:01 it's really its development this incredibly choreograph dance that happens the same way every time each one
00:10:11 of us builds the brain right and that builds an organ that allows us to do what we're doing today right yeah that
00:10:16 is mind blowing and this is why developmental neurobiologists never get tired in that now you're asking about
00:10:25 the code what drives this how is this done well it's you know millions of years of evolution of really fine-tuning
00:10:33 gene expression programs that allow certain cells to be made at a certain time and to be in to become a certain
00:10:43 you know cell type but also mechanical forces of pressure bending this embryo is not just it will not stay a tube this
00:10:52 this brain for very long at some point is tube in the front of the of the embryo will expand to make the
00:10:58 primordium of the brain right now they the forces that control that these cells feel and this is another beautiful thing
00:11:06 at the very force that they feel which is different from a week before a week ago will tell the cell oh you're being
00:11:14 squished in a certain way begin to produce these new genes because now you are at the corner or you are you know in
00:11:23 a stretch of cells or whatever it is and there so that mechanical physical force shapes the fate of the cell as well so
00:11:32 nala chemical is also mechana mechanical so from my perspective biology is this incredibly complex mess gooey mess so
00:11:44 you're seeing mechanical forces how different is a like a computer or any kind of mechanical machine that we
00:11:53 humans build and the biological systems have you been because you've worked a lot with biological systems are they as
00:12:00 much of a mess as it seems from a perspective of an engineer mechanical engineer yeah
00:12:09 they are much more prone to taking alternative routes right so if you we go back to printing a brain versus
00:12:18 developing a brain of course if you print a brain given that you start with the same building blocks the same cells
00:12:26 you could potentially print it the same way every time but that final brain may not work the same way as a brain built
00:12:35 during development does because the build very build very same building blocks that you're using developed in a
00:12:41 completely different environment right there was not the environment of the brain therefore they're going to be
00:12:48 different just by definition so if you instead use development to be able to say a brain organoid which maybe we'll
00:12:56 be talking about in a future those things are fascinating yes so if you if you use processes of development then
00:13:04 you when you watch it you can see that sometime things can go wrong in some organ weights and by wrong I mean
00:13:10 different one organ way from the next well if you think about that embryo it always goes right so it's this
00:13:18 development it's for as complexity as it is every time a baby is born has you know with very few exceptions so the
00:13:26 brain is like the next baby but it's not the same if you develop it in a dish and first of all is we don't even develop a
00:13:35 brain you develop something much simpler in the dish but there are more options for building things differently which
00:13:43 really tells you the evolution as has played a really tight game here for how in the end the brain is built in vivo so
00:13:55 just a quick may be dumb question but it seems like this is not the building process is not a dictatorship it seems
00:14:05 like there's not a centralized like high-level mechanism that says ok this cell built itself the wrong way I'm
00:14:12 going to kill it it seems like it's there's a really strong distributed mechanism is that is that in your sense for there
00:14:19 are a lot of there are a lot of possibilities right and if you think about for example different species
00:14:27 building their brain each brain is a little bit different so the brain of a lizard is very different from that of a
00:14:34 chicken from that of a you know one of us and so on and so forth and still is a brain but it was built differently if
00:14:43 starting from stem cells that pretty much had the same potential but in the end evolution builds
00:14:50 different brains in different species because that serves in a way the purpose of the species and the well-being of
00:14:59 that organism and so there are many possibilities but then there is a way and you were talking about a code nobody
00:15:06 knows what the entire code of development is of course we don't we know bitten bits and pieces of very
00:15:14 specific aspects of development of the brain what genes are involved to make a certain cell types out those two cells
00:15:19 interact to make the next level structure that we might know but the entirety of it oh it's so well control
00:15:26 it's really mind-blowing so in the first two months in the embryo or whatever the first few months
00:15:35 so yeah the the building blocks are constructed the actual the different regions of the brain I guess in the
00:15:42 nervous system well this continuous way longer than just the first few months so over the
00:15:50 the very first in a few months you build a lot of the cells but then there is a continuous building of new cell types
00:15:59 all the way through birth and then even post Natalie you know I don't know if you ever heard of myelin myelin is this
00:16:07 shrub insulation that is build around a cable some of the neurons so that the electricity can go really fast the front
00:16:14 axons I guess the axons are called axons exactly and and so as human beings we my alienate ourselves post Natalie a kid
00:16:27 you know a six-year-old kid has barely started so making the mature oligodendrocytes which are the cells then eventually will
00:16:36 wrap with the axons in to myelin and this will continue believe it or not until we are about you know 2530 years
00:16:44 old so there is a continuous process of maturation and tweaking and additions and and also in response to what we do I
00:16:53 remember taking ap biology in high school and in the textbook it said that I'm going by memory here that scientists
00:17:03 disagree on the purpose of myelin in in the brain is that is that's totally wrong so like it I guess it speeds up
00:17:13 the book okay might be wrong here but I guess it speeds up the electricity traveling down the axon or something
00:17:20 that's the most sort of canonical and definitely that's the case so you have to imagine an axon and you can think
00:17:27 about it as a cable or some type with electricity going through and what myelin does by insulating the outside I
00:17:36 should say there are tracks of myelin and pieces of axons that are naked without my Elaine and so by having the
00:17:42 insulation the electricity instead of going straight through the cable it would jump over a piece of myelin right
00:17:49 to the next naked little piece and jump again and therefore you you know that's the idea that you go faster and it was
00:17:58 always thought that in order to build a big brain a big nervous system in order to have a nervous system it can do very
00:18:06 complex the type of things then you need a lot of myelin because you want to go fast with this information from point A
00:18:15 to point B well a few years ago maybe five years ago or so we discovered that some of the most evolved which means the
00:18:24 newest type of neurons that we have as non-human primates as as human beings in the top of our cerebral cortex which
00:18:31 should be the neurons do some of the most complex things that we do well those F axons that have very little
00:18:40 myelin and they have very interesting way in which they put the smiling on their axles you know a little piece here then
00:18:47 a long track with no mining another chunk there and some don't have mining at all so now you have to explain where
00:18:58 we're going with evolution and if you think about it perhaps as an electrical engineer when I looked at it I initially
00:19:06 thought and I'm a developmental neurobiology I thought maybe this is what we see now but if we give evolution
00:19:14 another few million years we see a lot of myelin on these neurons - but I actually think now that that's instead
00:19:22 the future brain less myelin am i allow for more flexibility on what you do with your actions and therefore more
00:19:30 complicated and unpredictable type of functions which is also a bit mind-blowing so it seems like it's
00:19:38 controlling the timing of the signal so they're in the timing you can encode a lot of yes information
00:19:45 yeah and so the brain I mean the chemistry of that little piece of axon perhaps is a dynamic process where the
00:19:53 myelin can move now you see how many layers of variability you can add and that's actually really good
00:20:01 if you're trying to to come up with a new function or a new capability or something unpredictable in a way so
00:20:08 we're gonna jump around a little bit but the old question of how much is nature and how much is nurture in terms of this
00:20:18 incredible thing after the development is over we seem to be kind of somewhat smart intelligent cognition
00:20:28 consciousness all these things are just incredible ability reasons so on emerge in your sense how much is in the
00:20:36 hardware in the nature and how much is in the nurture has learned through with our parents to interact in the
00:20:43 environment so on it's really both right if you think about it so we are born with the brain as babies there has most
00:20:54 of his South and most of structures and we'll take a few years to you know to grow to add more to be better but really
00:21:04 then we have this 20 years of interacting with the environment around us and so what that brain that was so
00:21:11 you know perfectly built or imperfectly built due to our genetic cues will then be used to incorporate the environment
00:21:21 in its further maturation and development and so your experiences do shape your your brain I mean we know
00:21:29 that like if you know you and I may have had a different childhood or a different we have been going to different schools
00:21:36 we have been learning different things and our brain is a little bit different because of that we behave differently
00:21:42 because of that and and so especially postnatally experience is extremely important we are born with a plastic
00:21:50 brain what that means it's a brain it is able to change in response to stimuli they can be sensory so perhaps some of
00:22:01 the most illuminating studies that were done were studies in which the sensory organs were now working right if you are
00:22:09 born with eyes that don't work then your very brain that no piece of the brain that normally would process vision the
00:22:18 visual cortex develops postnatally differently and it might be used to do something different right so the most
00:22:27 extreme the plasticity of the brain I guess is the magic hardware that it and then it's it's flexibility in all forms
00:22:35 is what enables the learning yes Natalie can you talk about organoids what are they yes and how can you use
00:22:44 them to help us understand the brain and the development of the brain this is very very important so the first thing
00:22:50 I'd like to say please keep this in the video the first thing I'd like to say is that an organ or a brain organoid is not
00:23:01 the same as a brain okay it's a fundamental distinction it's a system a cellular system that one can
00:23:12 develop in the culture dish starting from stem cells that will mimic some aspects of the development of the
00:23:21 of the brain but not all of it they are very small maximum they become about you know four to five millimeters in
00:23:31 diameter they are much simpler than than our brain of course by yet they are the only system where we can literally watch
00:23:41 a process of human brain development unfold and by watch I mean study it remember when I told you that we can't
00:23:49 understand everything about development our own brain by studying a mouse well we can study the actual process of
00:23:54 development of the human brain because it all happens in utero so we will never have access to that process ever and
00:24:03 therefore this is our next best thing like a a bunch of stem cells that can be coaxed into starting a process of neural
00:24:13 tube formation remember that cube that is made by the embryo early on and from there a lot of the cell types that are
00:24:21 present within within the brain and you can simply watch it and study but you can also think about diseases where
00:24:31 development of the brain does not proceed normally right properly think about neurodevelopmental diseases there
00:24:38 are many many different types think about all these own spectrum disorders there are also many different types of
00:24:44 autism so there you could take a stem cell which really means either a sample of blood or a sample of skin from the
00:24:52 patient make a stem cell and then with that stem cell watch a process of formation of a brain organ with of their
00:25:00 person the person with that genetics with that genetic code in it and you can ask what is this genetic code doing to
00:25:08 some aspects of development of the brain for the first time you may come to solutions like what cells are involved
00:25:16 in autism so right so many questions around this so if you take this human stem cell for that particular
00:25:24 person with that genetic code how and you try to build an organized yeah how often will it look similar
00:25:34 what's the produce ability yes or how much variability its website of that yeah so there is much more variability
00:25:42 in building organoids than there than there is in building brain it's really true that the majority
00:25:49 of us when we are born as babies our brains look a lot like each other this is the magic that the embryo does where
00:25:56 it builds a brain in the context of a body and and there is very little variability there there is disease of
00:26:03 course but in general little variability when you build an organizer you know we don't have the full code for how this is
00:26:11 done and so in part the organoid somewhat built itself because there are some structures of the brain that the
00:26:20 cells know how to make and another part comes from the investigator the scientist add in to the media factors
00:26:27 that we know in the mouse for example would foster a certain step of development but it's very limited and so
00:26:37 as a result the kind of product you get in the end is much more reduction is this much more simple than what you get
00:26:44 in vivo it mimics early events of development as of today and it doesn't build very complex type of anatomy and
00:26:52 structure does not as of today which happens is that in in vivo and also the variability that you see one organ or to
00:27:00 the next tends to be higher than we'll compare an embryo to the next so okay then the next
00:27:09 question is how hard and maybe another flip side of that expensive is it to go from one stem cell to an organized yeah
00:27:16 how many can you build and like this sounds very complicated it's work definitely and it's money
00:27:26 definitely but you can really grow a very high number of this organoids you know can go
00:27:33 I told you the maximum they become about five millimeters in diameter so this is about the size of a of a tiny tiny you
00:27:42 know raising or perhaps the seed of an apple and so you can grow 50 to 100 of those inside one big bioreactors which
00:27:52 are these flasks where the media provides nutrients for the organoids so the problem is not to grow more or
00:28:04 less of them it it's really to figure out how to grow them in a way that they are more and more reproducible for
00:28:10 example orgonite organize so they can be used to study a biological process because if you have too much variability
00:28:17 then you never know if what you see is just an exception or really the rule so what is an organize look like are there
00:28:25 different neurons already emerging is there you know well first can you tell me what kind of neurons are there yes
00:28:35 are they sort of all the same are they not all the same as to how much do we understand and how much of that variance
00:28:47 if any can exist in organoids yes so you could grow I told you that the brain has different parts so the cerebral cortex
00:28:55 is on top at the top part of the brain but there is another region called the striatum that is below the cortex and so
00:29:00 on and so forth all of these regions have different types of cells in the actual brain ok and so scientists have
00:29:09 been able to grow organoids that may mimic some aspects of development of these different regions of the brain and
00:29:15 so we are very interested in the you're talking if we didn't have a cerebral cortex it's also I like to
00:29:26 think the part of the brain that really truly makes us human the most evolved in recent evolution and so in the attempt
00:29:34 to make the cerebral cortex and by figuring out a way to have this organoids continue to grow and develop
00:29:40 for extended periods of times much like it happens in the real embryo months and months in culture there
00:29:46 you can see that there many different types of neurons of the cortex appear and at some point also the astrocytes to
00:29:54 the glia cells of the cerebral cortex also appear what are these the astrocytes are not neuron so they're not
00:30:05 nerve cells but they they play very important roles one important role is to support the neuron but of course they
00:30:12 have much more active type of roles are very important for example to make the synapses which are the point of contacts
00:30:19 and communication between two neurons they all that chemistry fun happens between the synapses happens because of
00:30:29 these cells are they the medium in which it happens because of the interactions happens because you are making the cells
00:30:36 and they have certain properties including the ability to make you know neurotransmitters which are the
00:30:42 chemicals that are secreted to the synapses including the ability of making this axons grow with their growth cones
00:30:49 and so on and so forth and then you have other cells around there that release chemicals or touch the neurons or
00:30:57 interact with them in different ways to really foster this perfect process in this case of synaptogenesis and this
00:31:06 does happen within within organized so the mechanical and the chemists and chemical stuff happens yes the
00:31:12 connectivity between neurons this video why is not surprising because scientists have been culturing neurons forever and
00:31:20 when you take a new don't even a very young one and you culture it eventually finds another cell or another neuron to
00:31:27 talk to it will form a synapse are we talking about Meisner on my human neuron it doesn't matter both so you can
00:31:32 culture and you out like a single neuron and give it a little friend and it starts interacting yes so neurons
00:31:41 are able to it sounds it's more simple than what it may sound to you neurons have molecular properties and structural
00:31:49 properties allow them to really communicate with other cells and so if you put not one neuron but if you put
00:31:55 several neurons together chances are that they will form synapse is with each other okay great so an
00:32:07 organized not a brain but but  there's some it's able to especially what you're talking about mimic some properties of
00:32:15 the cerebral cortex for example so what what can you understand about the brain by studying an organize of a cerebral cortex
00:32:24 I can literally study how all this incredible diversity of cell type all these many many different classes of
00:32:31 cells how are they made how do they look like what do they need to be made properly and what goes wrong if now the
00:32:40 genetics of that stem cell that I used to make the organ we came from a patient with a neurodevelopmental disease can I
00:32:47 actually watch for the very first time what may have gone wrong years before in this kid when its own brain was being
00:32:55 made think about that loop in a way it's a little tiny rudimentary window into the past into the time when that brain
00:33:06 in a kid they had this you know developmental disease was being made and I think that's unbelievably powerful
00:33:15 because today we have no idea of what cell types we barely know what brain regions are affected in these diseases
00:33:23 now we have an experimental system that we can study in the lab and we can ask what are the cells affected when during
00:33:32 development things went wrong what are the molecules among the many many different molecules that that control
00:33:37 brain development which ones are the ones they're really messed up here and we want perhaps to fix and what is
00:33:45 really the final product is it a less strong kind of circuit and brain is it a brain that lacks a cell type is it what
00:33:53 is it because then we can think about treatment and and care for these patients that is informed rather than
00:34:02 just based on current diagnostics so how hard is it to detect through the development of process the
00:34:10 super-exciting mech tool just to see how different conditions develop how hard is it to detect it wait
00:34:19 a minute this is abnormal development yeah that's how hard is how much signal is there how much of it is is it a mess
00:34:28 because things can go wrong multiple levels right you could have a cell that is born and built but then doesn't work
00:34:38 properly or a self is not even born or a cell does interact with other cell differently and so on and so forth so
00:34:45 today we have technology that we did not have even five years ago that allows us to look for example at the molecular
00:34:53 picture of a cell of a single cell in a sea of cells with high precision and so that molecular information where you
00:35:02 compare many many single cells for the genes they produce between a control individual and an individual with and
00:35:10 your developmental disease that may tell you what is different molecular Li or you could see that some cells are not
00:35:19 even made for example or that the process of maturation of the cells may be wrong there are many different levels
00:35:28 here and and we can study these cells at the molecular level but also we can use the organ is to ask questions about the
00:35:36 properties of the neurons the functional properties how they communicate with each other out they respond to a
00:35:41 stimulus and so on and so forth and we may get at abnormalities their detectors so how early is this work in a maybe in
00:35:58 the history of science so I mean like so if you were to if you and I time travel a thousand years into the future
00:36:08 organize seem to be maybe I'm romanticizing the notion but you're building not a brain but something that
00:36:16 has properties of a brain so you it feels like you might be getting close to in the building process thought to build
00:36:23 us to understand so how how far are we in this understanding process of development
00:36:33 thousand years from now it's a long time from now so if this planet is still gonna be here and a thousand years from
00:36:41 now you know like they write a book obviously you there'll be a chapter about you that science fiction book
00:36:50 today today but I mean I guess where we really understood very little about the brain a century ago was big fan in high
00:36:57 school reading Freud and so on and still AM of Psychiatry I would say we still understand very little about the
00:37:05 functional aspect of just yeah but how in the history of understanding the biology of the brain the development how
00:37:11 far are we alone it's a very good question and so this is just of course my opinion I think that we did not have
00:37:21 technology even ten years ago or 20 certainly not 20 years ago to even think about experimentally investigating the
00:37:30 development of the human brain so we've done a lot of work in science to study the brain or many other organisms now we
00:37:38 have some technologies which I'll spell out that allow us to actually look at the real thing and look at the brain at
00:37:45 the human brain so what are these technologies there is been huge progress in stem cell biology the moment someone
00:37:54 figured out how to turn a skin cell into an embryonic stem cell basically and that out that embryonic stem cell could
00:38:02 begin a process of development again to correct for example make a brain there was a huge and you know advance and in
00:38:07 fact there was a Nobel Prize for that that started the field really of using stem cells to build organs now we can
00:38:16 build on all the knowledge of development that we build over the many many many years to say how do we make
00:38:21 the stem cells now make more and more complex aspects of development of the human brain so this field is younger the
00:38:29 field of brain organics but is moving faster and it's moving fast in a very serious way that is rooted in labs with
00:38:36 the right ethical framework and and really building on you know solid science for reality is and what is
00:38:46 not and but it will go faster and it will be more and more powerful we also have technology that allows us to
00:38:53 basically study the properties of single cells across many many millions of single cells which we didn't have
00:39:02 perhaps five years ago so now with that even an organ or that has millions of cells can be profiled in a way looked at
00:39:11 very very high resolution the single cell level to really understand what is going on and you could do it in multiple
00:39:17 stages of development and you can build your hypothesis and so on and so forth so it's not going to be a thousand years
00:39:24 it's gonna be a shorter amount of time and I see this as sort of a an exponential growth of this field enabled
00:39:34 by these technologies that we didn't have before and so we're gonna see something
00:39:38 transformative that we didn't see at all in the prior thousand years so I apologize for the crazy sci-fi questions
00:39:47 but the developmental process is fascinating to watch and study but how far are we away from and maybe how
00:39:57 difficult is it to build not just an organ or but a human brain okay from us themself yeah first of all that's not
00:40:07 the goal for the majority of the serious scientists that work on this because you don't have to build the whole human
00:40:16 brain to make this model useful for understanding of the brain develops or understanding disease you don't have to
00:40:22 build the whole thing so let me is let me just comment on that it's fascinating it shows to me the
00:40:29 difference between you and I is you're actually trying to understand the beauty of the human brain and to use it to
00:40:36 really help thousands or millions of people disease and so on right from an artificial intelligence but we're trying
00:40:44 to build systems that we can put in robots and try to create systems that have echoes of the intelligence
00:40:52 about reasoning about the world navigating the world its its different objectives I think we
00:41:00 operate in size fix a little bit but so so on that point of building a brain even though that is not the focus or
00:41:07 interest perhaps of the community how difficult is it is it truly science fiction at this point I think the field
00:41:15 will progress like I said and that the system will be more and more complex in a way right but there are properties
00:41:23 that emerge from the human brain they have to do with the mind they may have to do with conscious name I have to do
00:41:30 with intelligence or whatever that we don't really don't don't understand even now they can emerge from an actual real
00:41:36 brain and therefore we cannot measure or study in an organized so so I think that this field many many years from now may
00:41:46 lead to the building of better neural circuits of you know that really are built out of understanding about this
00:41:52 process really works and it's hard to predict how complex this really will be I really don't think we're so far from
00:42:01 it makes me laugh really it's really that far from building the human the human brain but you're gonna be building
00:42:10 something that is you know always a bad version of it but that may have really powerful properties and might be able to
00:42:19 you know respond to stimuli or or be used in in certain context and this is why I really think that there is no
00:42:26 other way to do this science but within the right ethical framework because where you're going with this is also you
00:42:33 know we can talk about science fiction and write that book and we could today but this work happens in a specific
00:42:42 ethical framework that we don't decide just a scientist but also as a society so the ethical framework here is a
00:42:50 fascinating one is the complicated one do you have a sense a grasp of how we think about ethically of building organoids
00:43:02 from human stem cells to understand the brain it seems like a tool for helping potentially millions of people cure
00:43:13 diseases are at least start the cure by understanding it but is there more is there gray areas that are at the that we
00:43:22 have to think about ethically absolutely we must think about that every discussion about the ethics of this
00:43:32 needs to be based on actual data from the models that we have today and from the ones that we will have tomorrow so
00:43:38 it's a continuous conversation it's not something that you decide now today there is no issue really very simple
00:43:45 models they that clearly can help you in many ways without much much think about but tomorrow we need to have another
00:43:53 conversation and so on and so forth and so the way we do this is to actually really bring together constantly a group
00:44:00 of people that are not only scientists but also bioethicists the lawyers philosophers psychiatrist and so on as a
00:44:07 psychologist and so on and so forth to decide as a society really what we should and what we should not do so
00:44:17 that's the way to think about the ethics now I also think though that as a scientist I have a moral responsibility
00:44:26 so if you if you think about how transformative it could be for understanding and curing a neuropsychiatrist
00:44:36 to be able to actually watch and study and treat with drugs the very brain of the patient that you are trying to study
00:44:45 how transformative at this moment in time this could be we couldn't do it five years ago we could do it now right
00:44:52 if taking of a particular patient patient and make an organ or for a simple and you know different from the
00:45:00 from the human brain he still is his process of brain development with his with his or her genetics and we could
00:45:07 understand perhaps what is going wrong perhaps we could use as a platform as a cellular platform to screen for drugs to
00:45:13 fix a process and so on and so forth right so we could do it now we couldn't do it five years
00:45:21 ago should we not do it what is the downside of doing it I don't see a downside if you would but if we invited
00:45:30 a lot of people yes if I'm sure there would be somebody who would would argue against it what would be the devil's
00:45:39 advocate argument yeah so it's exactly perhaps what you eluded it with your question that you are
00:45:49 making as enabling you know some some process of formation of the brain that could be misused at some point or there
00:45:59 could be showing properties that ethically we don't want to see in a tissue so today today this is not an
00:46:09 issue and so you you just gain dramatically from the science without because the system is so simple and and
00:46:16 so different in a way from from the actual brain but but because it is the brain we have an obligation to really
00:46:24 consider all of this right and again it's it's a balanced conversation where we should put disease and betterment of
00:46:33 humanity also on that plate what do you think at least historically there were some politicization of embryonic stem
00:46:47 cells a stem cell research do you still see that out there is there is that still a force that we have to think
00:46:55 about especially in this larger discourse that we're having about the role of science in at least American
00:47:02 society yeah this is a very good question it's very very important I see a very central role for scientist to
00:47:12 inform decisions about what we should or should not do in society and this is because the scientists have the
00:47:20 first-hand look and understanding of really the work that they are doing and again this varies depending on what
00:47:27 we're talking about here so now we're talking about Brian organoids I think the scientists need to
00:47:35 be part of that conversation about what is will be allowed in the future or not allowed in the future to do with the
00:47:42 system and I think it's that is very very important because they bring reality of data to the conversation and
00:47:51 and and so they should have a voice so data should have a voice it needs to have a voice because a not
00:47:59 only data we should also be good at communicating with non scientists the data so there has been often time there
00:48:10 is a lot of discussion and you know excitement and fights about certain topics just because of the way they are
00:48:21 described I'll give you an example if I call that the same cellular system we just talked about a brain organoid or if
00:48:30 i called it a human mini brain your reaction is going to be very different yes to this and so the way the systems
00:48:39 are described I mean we and journalists alike need to be a bit careful that this debate is a real debate and inform
00:48:48 burial data that's all I'm asking and yeah the language matters here so I work on autonomous vehicles and their the use
00:48:54 of language could it could it could drastically change the interpretation and the way people feel about what is
00:49:00 the right way to proceed forward you are as I've seen from a presentation you're a parent as I show a couple
00:49:11 pictures of your son is it just the one to sign a daughter so what have you learned from the human bracing two of
00:49:27 them what have I learned I've learned that children really have this amazing plastic minds right that we have a
00:49:36 responsibility to you know foster their growth in good healthy ways that keep them curious that keeps
00:49:44 adventures that doesn't raise them in fear of things but also respecting who they are which is in part you know
00:49:51 coming from their genetics we talked about my children are very different from each other despite the fact that
00:49:57 they're the product of the same two parents I also learned that what you do for them comes back to you like you know
00:50:06 if you're a good parent you're gonna most of the time have you know perhaps a decent kids at the end what do you think
00:50:14 just a quick comment what what do you think is the source of that difference it's often the surprising thing for
00:50:22 parents is it can't believe that our kids oh they're so different yet they came from the same parents well they are
00:50:30 genetically different even they came from the same two parents because the mixing of gametes I mean you know we
00:50:37 know these genetics creates every time a genetically different individual which will have a specific mix of genes that
00:50:45 is a different mix every time from the two parents and so so they're not twins so they are genetically different is
00:50:55 that a little bit of variation as you said really from a biological perspective the brains look pretty
00:51:02 similar well so let me clarify that so the genetics you have the genes that you have at that play that beautiful
00:51:10 orchestrated symphony of development different genes will play it slightly differently it's like playing the same
00:51:17 piece of music but with the different orchestra and a different director right the music will not come out it will be
00:51:24 still a piece by the same you know author but it will come out differently if it's played by the high school
00:51:37 orchestra instead of and so you are born superficially with the same brain it has the same cell types similar patterns of
00:51:44 connectivity but the properties of the cells and how the cells we then react to the environment as you experience your
00:51:52 word will be also shaped by pujan ethically you are speaking just as a parent this is not something that comes from my
00:52:01 differently that they have a different personality in a in a way right so both is needed the genetics as well as the
00:52:12 nurturing afterwards so you are one human with a brain instead of living through the whole mess of it the human
00:52:21 condition full of love maybe fear ultimately mortal how has studying the brain changed the way you see yourself
00:52:28 and you look in the mirror when you think about your life the fear is the love when you see your own life your own
00:52:36 mortality yeah that's a very good question it's almost impossible to dissociate sometime for me some of the
00:52:46 things we do or some of the things that other people do from oh that's because that part of the brain is working in a
00:52:58 certain way or thinking about a teenager you know going through teenage years and being at I'm funny in the way they think
00:53:06 and impossible for me not to think it's because they're going through this period of time called critical periods
00:53:14 of plasticity where their synapses are being eliminated here and there and they're just confused and so from that
00:53:22 comes perhaps a different take on the behavior or maybe I can justify scientifically in some sort of way I
00:53:32 also look at humanity in general and I am amazed by what we can do and the kind of ideas that we can come up where then
00:53:42 I cannot stop thinking about how the brain is continuing to evolve I don't know if you do this but I think about
00:53:50 the next brain sometimes what are we going with it's like what are the features of this brain that you know
00:53:58 evolution is really plain wait to get us you know in the future the new brain it's not over right it's it's a work in progress
00:54:09 so let me just a quick comment on do you see do you think there's a there's a lot of fascination and hope
00:54:16 for artificial intelligence of creating artificial brains you said the next brain when you imagine over a period of
00:54:24 a thousand years the evolution of the human brain do you sometimes envisioning that future see an artificial one
00:54:33 artificial intelligence as it is hoped by many not hoped thought by many people would be actually the next evolutionary
00:54:41 step in the development yeah yeah I think in a way that will happen right it's almost like a part of the way we
00:54:50 evolved we evolved in the world that we created that we interact with the shape has as we grow up and so on and so forth
00:54:59 sometimes I think about something that may sound silly but think about the use of of cell phones part of me thinks that
00:55:07 somehow in their brain there will be a region of the cortex that is this much attuned to that tool and and this comes
00:55:18 from a lot of studies in in in model organisms where really the cortex especially adapts to the kind of things
00:55:25 you have to do so if we need to move our fingers in a very specific way we have a part of our cortex that allows us to do
00:55:34 this kind of very precise movement in an owl that has to see very very far away with big eyes the visual cortex very big
00:55:41 it's the brain attuned to your environment so the brain will attune to the to the technologies that we will
00:55:50 have and will be shaped by it so the cortex very well maybe we shaped by it in the artificial intelligence it
00:55:59 may merge with it they may get a envelop it and adjust if it's not you know emerge of the kind of oh let's have a
00:56:07 synthetic element together with a biological one the very space around us the fact for example think about we put
00:56:15 on some goggles of virtual reality and we physically are surfing the ocean right like I've done it and you have all
00:56:23 these emotions that come to you you brain placed you in that reality and it was able to do it like that just by
00:56:32 putting the goggles on it didn't take thousands of years of adapting to this the brain is plastic so adapts to new
00:56:41 technology so you could do it from the outside by simply hijacking some sensory capacities that we have so clearly over
00:56:52 you know recent evolution the cerebral cortex has been a part of the brain that has known the most evolution so we have
00:57:00 put a lot of chips on evolving this specific part of the brain and the evolution of cortex is plasticity it's
00:57:08 this ability to change in response to things so yes they will integrate that we want it or not well there is no
