00:00:01 the following is a conversation with russ tedrick a roboticist and professor at mit and vice president
00:00:07 of robotics research at toyota research institute or tri he works on control of robots in interesting
00:00:17 complicated underactuated stochastic difficult to model situations he's a great teacher and a great person
00:00:24 one of my favorites at mit we'll get into a lot of topics in this conversation from his time leading
00:00:32 mit's delta robotics challenge team to the awesome fact that he often runs close to a marathon a day
00:00:40 to and from work barefoot for a world-class roboticist interested in elegant efficient control
00:00:47 of underactually dynamical systems like the human body this fact makes russ one of the most fascinating people i know

00:04:31 what is the most beautiful motion of a animal or robot that you've ever seen i think the most beautiful
00:04:39 motion of a robot has to be the passive dynamic walkers i think there's just something
00:04:43 fundamentally beautiful the ones in particular that steve collins built with andy rowena
00:04:50 at cornell a 3d walking machine so it was not confined to a boom or a plane that you put it on top of a small ramp
00:04:59 give it a little push it's powered only by gravity no controllers no batteries whatsoever
00:05:06 it just falls down the ramp and at the time it looked more natural more graceful more human-like
00:05:13 than any robot we'd seen to date powered only by gravity how does it work well okay the simplest
00:05:19 model is kind of like a slinky it's like an elaborate slinky one of the simplest models we use to
00:05:24 think about it is actually a rimless wheel so imagine taking a bike's bicycle wheel but take the rim
00:05:31 off so it's now just got a bunch of spokes if you give that a push it still wants to roll down the ramp but
00:05:36 every time its foot its spoke comes around and hits the ground it loses a little energy
00:05:43 every time it takes a step forward it gains a little energy those things can come into perfect
00:05:48 balance and actually they they want to it's a stable phenomenon if it's going too slow it'll speed up
00:05:55 if it's going too fast it'll slow down and it comes into a stable periodic motion now you can take that rimless wheel
00:06:03 which doesn't look very much like a human walking take all the extra spokes away put a
00:06:07 hinge in the middle now it's two legs that's called our compass gate walker
00:06:13 that can still you give it a little push starts falling down a ramp looks a little bit more like walking at
00:06:19 least it's a biped but what steve and andy and ted mcgear started the whole exercise but what
00:06:25 steve and andy did was they took it to this beautiful conclusion where they built something that had knees
00:06:34 arms a torso the arms swung naturally  give it a little push and that looked like a stroll through the park
00:06:40 how do you design something like that i mean is that art or science it's on the boundary i think there's a
00:06:45 science to getting close to the solution i think there's certainly art in the way that they
00:06:53 they made a beautiful robot but but then the finesse because because this was work
00:06:57 they were working with a system that wasn't perfectly modeled wasn't perfectly controlled
00:07:03 there's all these little tricks that you have to tune the suction cups at the knees for instance so
00:07:08 they stick but then they release at just the right time or there's all these little tricks of the trade
00:07:14 which really are art but it was a point i mean it made the point and we were at that time the walking
00:07:19 robot the best walking robot in the world was honda's asimo absolutely marvel of modern engineering
00:07:25 it's 90s this was in 97 when they first released it sort of announced p2 and then it went
00:07:30 through it was asimo by then in 2004 and it looks like this very cautious walking
00:07:40 like you're walking on on hot coals or something like that i think it gets a bad rap asimo is a
00:07:46 beautiful machine it does walk with its knees bent our atlas walking had its knees bent but
00:07:52 actually ezimo was pretty fantastic but it wasn't energy efficient neither was atlas
00:07:58 when we worked on atlas none of our robots have that have been that complicated have
00:08:03 been very energy efficient but there was a there's a thing that happens when you do control
00:08:10 when you try to control a system of that complexity you try to use your motors to basically counteract gravity
00:08:19 take whatever the world's doing to you and push back erase the dynamics of the world and
00:08:25 impose the dynamics you want because you can make them simple and analyzable mathematically simple
00:08:33 and this was a very sort of beautiful example that you don't have to do that you can just let go let physics do most
00:08:40 of the work right and you just have to give it a little bit of energy this one only walked down a ramp it would never
00:08:45 walk on the flat to walk on the flat you have to give a little energy at some point but maybe instead of trying to take the
00:08:53 forces imparted to you by the world and replacing them what we should be doing is letting the world push us around
00:09:00 and we go with the flow very zen very zen robot yeah but okay so that sounds very zen
00:09:05 but you can i can also imagine how many like failed versions they had to go through like how
00:09:13 many like i would say it's probably would you say it's in the thousands that they've had
00:09:16 to have the system fall down before they figured out how they could i don't know if it's
00:09:22 thousands but  it's a lot it takes some patience there's no question so in that sense control might help a
00:09:28 little bit oh the abs i think everybody even at the time said that the answer is to do with that
00:09:35 with control but it was just pointing out that maybe the way we're doing control right now
00:09:41 isn't the way we should got it so what what about on the animal side the ones that figured out how to move
00:09:47 efficiently is there anything you find inspiring or beautiful in the movement of anybody i do have a favorite example
00:09:55 okay so it sort of goes with the passive walking idea so is there you know how energy efficient are
00:10:02 animals okay there's a great series of experiments by george lotter at harvard and mike tranifilo at mit
00:10:09 they were studying fish swimming in a water tunnel okay and one of these the type of fish
00:10:15 they were studying were these rainbow trout because they there was a
00:10:20 phenomenon well understood that rainbow trout when they're swimming upstream at mating season
00:10:24 they kind of hang out behind the rocks and it looks like i mean that's tiring work swimming upstream
00:10:29 they're hanging out behind the rocks maybe there's something energetically interesting there so they tried to
00:10:33 recreate that they put in this water tunnel a rock basically a cylinder
00:10:40 that had the same sort of vortex street the eddies coming off the back of the rock that you would see in a stream
00:10:46 and they put a real fish behind this and watched how it swims and the amazing thing is that if you
00:10:51 watch from above what the fish swims when it's not behind a rock it has a particular gate
00:10:57 you can identify the fish the same way you look at a human looking walking down the street you sort of have a sense of
00:11:02 how human walks the fish has a characteristic gate you put that fish behind the rock its gate changes
00:11:11 and what they saw was that it was actually resonating and kind of surfing between the vortices yeah
00:11:19 now here was the experiment that really was the clincher because there was still it wasn't clear how much of that was
00:11:24 mechanics of the fish how much of that is control the brain so the clincher experiment and
00:11:29 maybe one of my favorites to date although there are many good experiments they took
00:11:38 this was now a dead fish they took a dead fish they put a string that went that tied
00:11:44 the mouse of the fish to the rock so it couldn't go back and get caught in the grates  and then they
00:11:48 asked what would that dead fish do when it was hanging out behind the rock and so what you'd expect it sort of
00:11:53 flopped around like a dead fish in the in the vortex wake until something sort of amazing happens and
00:11:59 this video is worth putting in right what happens  the dead fish
00:12:06 basically starts swimming upstream right it's completely dead no brain no motors no control but it somehow the mechanics
00:12:15 of the fish resonate with the vortex street and it starts swimming upstream it's one of the best examples ever
00:12:23 who do you give credit for that too is that just evolution constantly just figuring out by killing a lot of
00:12:30 generations of animals  like the most efficient motion is that  or maybe the
00:12:38 physics of our world completely like it's like evolution applied not only to animals but just the entirety of it somehow
00:12:46 drives to efficiency like nature likes efficiency i don't know if that question even makes any sense i understand the question
00:12:53 that's reason i mean do they co-evolve yeah somehow yeah like i don't know if an environment can
00:12:59 evolve but i mean there are experiments that people do careful experiments that show that
00:13:06 animals can adapt to unusual situations and recover efficiency so there seems like at least in one
00:13:11 direction i think there is reason to believe that the animal's motor system
00:13:18 and probably its mechanics adapt in order to be more efficient but efficiency isn't the only goal of course
00:13:25 sometimes it's too easy to think about only efficiency but we have to do a lot of other things
00:13:31 first not get eaten and then all other things being equal try to save energy by the way let's 
00:13:36 draw a distinction between control and mechanics like how how can how would you define each yeah i
00:13:43 mean i think part of the point is that we shouldn't draw a line as as clearly as we tend to
00:13:50 but the you know on a robot we have motors and we have the links of the robot let's say if the motors are turned off the robot
00:13:58 has some passive dynamics okay gravity does the work you can put springs i would call that mechanics
00:14:04 right if we have springs and dampers which our muscles are springs and dampers and tendons
00:14:09 but then you have something that's doing active work putting energy in your motors on the robot the
00:14:15 controller's job is to send commands to the motor that add new energy into the system
00:14:21 right so the mechanics and control interplay somewhere the divide is around you know did you decide to send some
00:14:27 commands to your motor or did you just leave the motors off and let them do their work
00:14:35 would you say is most of nature on the dynamic side or the control side so like if you look at biological
00:14:42 systems if you know we're living in a pandemic now like do you think a virus is a
00:14:51 do you think it's a dynamic system or or is there a lot of control intelligence i think it's both but i
00:14:55 think we maybe have underestimated how important the dynamics are
00:15:02 right i mean even our bodies the mechanics of our bodies certainly with exercise they evolved but
00:15:09 so i actually i lost a finger in early 2000s and it's my fifth metacarpal it turns out you use that a lot in ways
00:15:18 you don't expect when you're opening jars even when i'm just walking around if i bump it on something
00:15:23 there's a bone there that was used to taking contact my fourth metacarpal wasn't used to taking contact it used to hurt
00:15:31 it still does a little bit but actually my bone has remodeled right over the lat over a couple years
00:15:41 the geometry the mechanics of that bone change to address the new circumstances so the idea that somehow
00:15:47 it's only our brain that's adapting or evolving is not right maybe sticking on evolution for a bit because
00:15:55 it's tended to create some interesting things  by peter walking
00:16:02 do you  why the heck did evolution give us i think we're are we the only mammals
00:16:06 that walk on two feet no i mean there's a bunch of animals that do it
00:16:12 a bit there's a i think we are the most successful bypass i think some  i think i read somewhere that
00:16:20 the reason the you know evolution made us walk on two feet is because  there's an advantage
00:16:28 to being able to carry food back to the tribe or something like that so like you can carry it's kind of this communal
00:16:36 cooperative thing so like to carry stuff back to to a place of shelter and so on to share with others do you understand
00:16:44 at all the value of  walking on two feet from both a robotics and a human perspective
00:16:51 yeah there are some great books written about evolution of walking evolution of the human body i
00:16:56 think it's easy though to make bad evolutionary arguments sure most of them are probably bad but
00:17:08 what else can we do i mean i think a lot of what dominated our evolution probably was not
00:17:15 the things that worked well sort of in the steady state you know when things are when things are
00:17:22 good but but  for instance people talk about what we should eat now because
00:17:27 our ancestors were meat eaters or or whatever oh yeah i love that yeah but probably you know the reason that
00:17:37 one pre  pre-homo sapien species versus another survived was not because of whether they
00:17:42 ate well  when there was lots of food but when the ice age came
00:17:49 you know probably one of them happened to be in the wrong place one of them happened to forage a food
00:17:54 that was okay even even when the glaciers came or something like that i mean
00:17:59 there's a million variables that contributed and we can't and our actually the amount of
00:18:04 information we're working with and telling these stories these evolutionary stories is  is very little
00:18:12 so yeah just like you said it seems like if we if we study history it seems like
00:18:16 history turns on like these little events that  that otherwise would seem meaningless but in the grant like when you in retrospect
00:18:28 were turning points absolutely and that that's probably how like somebody got hit in the head with a rock
00:18:33 because somebody slept with the wrong person back in the cave days and somebody get angry and
00:18:39 that turned  you know warring tribes combined with the environment
00:18:45 all those millions of things and the meat eating which i get a lot of criticism because i
00:18:49 i don't know i don't know what your dietary processes are like but these days i been eating only meat
00:18:58 which is there's a large community people who say yeah probably make evolutionary arguments and say you do a
00:19:03 great job there's probably an even larger community of people including my mom
00:19:08 who says it's deeply unhealthy it's wrong but i just feel good doing it but you're right these evolutionary
00:19:14 arguments can be flawed but is there anything interesting to pull out for there's a great book by the way look
00:19:21 a series of books by nicholas taleb about fooled by randomness and black swan um
00:19:26 highly recommend them but yeah they make the point nicely that probably it was a few
00:19:35 random events that yes maybe it was someone getting hit by a rock as you say  that said do you think i don't know
00:19:43 how to ask this question or how to talk about this but there's something elegant and beautiful about moving on two feet
00:19:50 obviously biased because i'm human but from a robotics perspective too you work with robots on two feet
00:19:58 is it is it all useful to build robots that are on two feet as opposed to four
00:20:02 is there something useful about it the most i mean the reason i spent a long time working on bipedal
00:20:08 walking was because it was hard and it was it challenged control theory in ways that i thought were important
00:20:17 i wouldn't have ever tried to convince you that you should start a company around bipeds or
00:20:24 something like this there are people that make pretty compelling arguments right i think the
00:20:27 most compelling one is that the world is built for the human form and if you want a robot to work in the
00:20:34 world we have today then you know having a human form is a pretty good way to go
00:20:41 there there are places that a biped can go that would be hard for other form factors to go even natural places
00:20:50 but you know at some point in the long run we'll be building our environments for
00:20:54 our robots probably and so maybe that argument falls aside do you still run barefoot i still run
00:21:04 barefoot that's so awesome much to my wife's chagrin do you want to make an evolutionary
00:21:10 argument for why running barefoot is advantageous what have you learned about human and robot movement in general from
00:21:21 running barefoot human or robot and or well you know it happened the other way
00:21:27 right so i was studying walking robots and i was there's a great conference called the dynamic walking
00:21:35 conference where it brings together both the biomechanics community and the walking robots community and so
00:21:41 i've been going to this for years and hearing talks by people who study barefoot running and other the mechanics of running
00:21:50 so i i did eventually read born to run most people read born to run in the first thing
00:21:55 right the other thing i had going for me is actually that i i wouldn't i wasn't a runner before and
00:22:00 i learned to run after i had learned about barefoot running i mean started running longer distances
00:22:07 so i didn't have to unlearn and i'm definitely i'm a big fan of it for me but i'm not gonna
00:22:14 i tend to not try to convince other people there's people who run beautifully with shoes on and that's good um
00:22:23 but here's why it makes sense for me it's all about the long-term game right so i think it's just too easy to run 10 miles
00:22:31 feel pretty good and then you get home at night and you realize  my knees hurt i did something wrong right
00:22:39 if you take your shoes off then if you hit hard with your foot at all then it hurts you don't like run 10 miles
00:22:49 and then and then realize you've done something some damage you have immediate feedback telling you that you've done something
00:22:55 that's that's maybe sub-optimal and you change your gait i mean it's even subconscious if i right
00:22:59 now having run many miles barefoot if i put a shoe on my gate changes
00:23:05 in a way that i think is not as good so so it makes me land softer and i think my my goals for running are to
00:23:14 do it for as long as i can into old age not to win any races and so for me this is a you know
00:23:25 a way to protect myself yeah i think first of all i've tried running barefoot many years ago
00:23:31  probably the other way just just just  reading born to run but just to understand because i felt like i couldn't
00:23:41 put in the miles that i wanted to and it feels like running for me and i think for a lot of people
00:23:48 was one of those activities that we do often and never really try to learn to do correctly like it's
00:23:55 funny there's so many activities we do every day like brushing our teeth right i think a lot of us at least me
00:24:04 probably have never deeply studied how to properly brush my teeth right or wash as now with a pandemic or
00:24:10 how to properly wash our hands or do it every day but we haven't really studied like am i
00:24:15 doing this correctly but running felt like one of those things it was absurd not to study how to do
00:24:21 correctly because it's the source of so much pain and suffering like i hate running but i
00:24:25 do it i do it because i hate it but it i feel good afterwards
00:24:30 but i think it feels like you need to learn how to do it properly so that's where barefoot running came in and then
00:24:35 i quickly realized that my gait was completely wrong i was taking huge like steps
00:24:44 and landing hard on the heel all those elements and so yeah from that i actually learned to take
00:24:51 really small steps look i already forgot the number but i feel like it was 180 a minute or something
00:24:55 like that and i remember i was  i actually just took songs that are 180 beats per minute
00:25:06 and then like tried to run at that beat  just to teach myself it took took a long time and i feel like 
00:25:12 after a while you learn to run you adjust it properly without going all the way to barefoot
00:25:18 but i feel like barefoot is the legit way to do it i mean i think a lot of people would be
00:25:23 really curious about it can you if they're interested in trying what would you
00:25:29 how would you recommend a start or try or explore slowly that's the biggest thing people do is they
00:25:36 are excellent runners and they're used to running long distances or running fast and they take their shoes off and they
00:25:42 hurt themselves instantly trying to do something that they were used to doing i i think i lucked out in the sense that
00:25:47 i i couldn't run very far when i first started trying and i run with minimal shoes too i mean
00:25:52 i will you know bring along a pair of actually like aqua socks or something like this i
00:25:56 can just slip on or running sandals i've tried all of them
00:26:02 what's the difference between a minimal shoe and nothing at all what's like feeling wise what does it
00:26:06 feel like there is i mean i noticed my gate changing right
00:26:13 so i mean your your foot has as many muscles and sensors as your hand does right
00:26:21 sensors ooh okay and we do amazing things with our hands and we stick our foot in a big solid
00:26:27 shoe right so there's i think you know when you're barefoot you're you're just giving yourself more
00:26:33 proprioception and that's why you're more aware of some of the gait flaws and stuff like this now you have
00:26:39 less protection too so rocks and stuff i mean yeah so so i think people are who are
00:26:45 afraid of barefoot running they're worried about getting cuts or getting stepping on rocks
00:26:51 first of all even if that was a concern i think those are all like  very short-term you know if i get a
00:26:55 scratch or something it'll heal in a week if i blow out my knees i'm done running forever so i will trade the short term
00:27:00 for the long term anytime but even then you know this again to my wife's chagrin your feet
00:27:07 get tough right and   cows okay yeah i can run i mean what  maybe can you talk about
00:27:21 is there tin like is there tips or tricks that you have  suggestions about like if i wanted to
00:27:26 try it you know there is a good book actually  there's probably more
00:27:33 good books since i read them but  ken bob barefoot ken bob saxton he's an interesting guy but i think his
00:27:40 book captured  the right way to describe running barefoot running to somebody
00:27:48 better than any other i've seen so you run pretty good distances and you bike and is is there um
00:27:57 you know if we talk about bucket list items is there something crazy on your bucket list athletically that
00:28:04 you hope to do one day i mean my commute is already a little crazy what are we talking about here
00:28:10 what what  what distance are we talking about well i live about 12 miles from mit but you can find lots of
00:28:17 different ways to get there so i mean i've run there for a long many years a bike there
00:28:21 blaze yeah but normally i would try to run in and then bike home
00:28:27 bike in run home but you have run there and back before sure barefoot yeah  yeah or with minimal
00:28:32 shoes or whatever that 12 12 times two yeah okay it became kind of a game of how can i
00:28:39 get to work i've rollerbladed i've done all kinds of weird stuff but  my favorite one these days is i've been
00:28:45 taking the charles river to work so i can put in a little row boat not so far from my house but the charles
00:28:52 river takes a long way to get to mit so i can spend a long time getting there
00:28:58 and it's you know it's not about i don't know it's just about  i've had people ask me how can you
00:29:04 justify taking that time  but for me it's just a magical time to think to compress decompress
00:29:15 you know especially i'll wake up do a lot of work in the morning and then i kind of have to just let that settle
00:29:20 before i i'm ready for all my meetings and then on the way home it's a great time to
00:29:24 load it sort of let that settle so you you lead a like a a large group of people i mean you're
00:29:34 is there days where you're like oh like i i mean  is is there is there a tension there
00:29:47 where and like if we look at the grand scheme of things just like you said long term that meeting probably doesn't matter
00:29:53 like you can always say i'll just i'll run and let the meeting happen how it happens
00:30:00 like what  how do you that zen how do you  what do you do with that tension
00:30:05 between the real world saying urgently you need to be there this is important everything is melting down
00:30:11 how we're going to fix this robot there's this  critical meeting and then there's this
00:30:17 the zen beauty of just running the simplicity of it you along with nature
00:30:23 what do you do with that i would say i'm not a fast runner particularly probably my fastest splits ever was when
00:30:29 i had to get to daycare on time because they were going to charge me you know some some dollar per minute
00:30:33 that i was late  i've run some fast splits to daycare but that those times are passed now
00:30:43 i think work you can find a work-life balance in that way i think you just have to
00:30:49 i think i am better at work because i take time to think on the way in so i plan my day
00:30:55 around it and i i rarely feel that those are really in
00:31:03 at odds so what the bucket list item if we're talking 12 times 2 or approaching a marathon 
00:31:14 what  have you run an ultra marathon before do you do races is there what's i'm not gonna like take a dinghy across
00:31:24 the atlantic or something if that's what you want but   but if someone does and wants to write a
00:31:29 book i would totally read it because i'm a sucker for that kind of thing no i do have some fun things that i will
00:31:34 try you know i like to when i travel i almost always bike to logan airport and fold up a little
00:31:39 folding bike on and then take it with me and bike to wherever i'm going and i've it's taken me or i'll take a
00:31:44 stand-up paddleboard these days on the airplane and then i'll try to paddle around where i'm going or whatever
00:31:50 and i've done some crazy things but but not for the you know i've i now talk i don't know if
00:31:56 you know who david goggins is by any chance not well but yeah but i i talk to him now every day so he's the person
00:32:05 who made me  do this stupid challenge so he he's insane and he does things for the purpose
00:32:11 in in the best kind of way he does things like for the explicit purpose of suffering like he picks the thing that like
00:32:20 whatever he thinks he can do he does more  so is that do you have that thing in you or you  i think it's
00:32:27 become the opposite it's  so you're like that dynamical system that
00:32:36 the walker the efficient  yeah it's  leave no pain right you should end feeling better than you started okay but
00:32:45 it's mostly i think and kovit has tested this because i've lost my commute i think i'm perfectly happy walking
00:32:50 around  around town with my wife and  kids if they could get them to go
00:32:57 and it's more about just getting outside and getting away from the keyboard for some time just to let things compress
00:33:04 let's go into robotics a little bit what to use the most beautiful idea in robotics whether we're talking about control or
00:33:12 whether we're talking about optimization the math side of things or the engineering side of things or the
00:33:22 i think i've been lucky to experience something that not so many roboticists have experienced
00:33:30 which is to hang out with some really amazing control theorists and 
00:33:41 the clarity of thought that some of the more mathematical control theory can bring to even very complex messy looking problems
00:33:52 is really it really had a big impact on me and and  i had a day even like just a couple weeks ago where i had
00:33:59 spent the day on a zoom robotics conference having great conversations with lots of people
00:34:06 i felt really good about the ideas that were flowing and and the like and then i had a you know
00:34:14 late afternoon meeting with  one of my favorite control theorists and and we went from these
00:34:21 from these abstract discussions about maybes and what-ifs and and what a great idea to these super precise
00:34:31 statements about systems that aren't that much more simple or or abstract than the ones
00:34:36 i care about deeply and the contrast of that is i don't know it really gets me i think
00:34:49 people underestimate maybe the power of clear thinking and so for instance deep learning
00:35:00 is amazing i use it heavily in our work i think it's changed the world
00:35:08 unquestionable it makes it easy to get things to work without thinking as critically about it so i think one of the
00:35:13 challenges as an educator is to think about how do we make sure people get a taste
00:35:20 of the more rigorous thinking that i think goes along  with with some different approaches yeah so that's really interesting so
00:35:29 understanding like the fundamentals the first principles of the of the the the problem where in this case is mechanics
00:35:38 like how a thing moves how thing behaves like all the forces involved like really getting a deep understanding
00:35:46 of that i mean from physics the first principle thing come from physics and here it's
00:35:51 literally physics yeah and this applies in deep learning this applies to um
00:35:58 not just i mean it applies so cleanly in in robotics but it also applies to just in any data set
00:36:06 i find this true i mean driving as well there's a lot of folks in it that work on autonomous vehicles
00:36:21 like deeply i i might be coming a little bit from the psychology side but i remember i spent
00:36:30 a ridiculous number of hours at lunch at this like lawn chair and i would sit somewhere somewhere on mit's campus there's a few
00:36:37 interesting intersections and we just watched people cross so we were studying pedestrian behavior
00:36:45 and i felt like as you record a lot of video to try and just the computer vision extracts
00:36:49 their movements how they move their head and so on but like every time i felt like i didn't understand
00:36:57 enough i i just i felt like i wasn't understanding what how are people signaling to each other
00:37:04 what are they thinking how cognizant are they of their fear of death like what we like what's the game what's
00:37:12 the underlying game theory here what are what are the the the incentives and then i finally
00:37:15 found a live stream  of an intersection that's like high def that i just i would
00:37:21 watch so i wouldn't have to sit out there but that's interesting so like that's tough that's a tough example
00:37:27 because i mean the learning humans are involved not just because human but i think the learning mantra is the basically the
00:37:36 statistics of the data will tell me things i need to know right and you know for the example you gave of all
00:37:43 the nuances of you know eye contact or hand gestures or whatever that are happening
00:37:49 for these subtle interactions between pedestrians and traffic right maybe the data will tell us
00:37:54 they'll tell that story i may be even i  one level more meta than than what you're saying
00:38:03 for a particular problem i think it might be the case that data should tell us the story but i think
00:38:09 there's a rigorous thinking that is just an essential skill for a mathematician or an engineer
00:38:17 that i just don't want to lose it yes there are there are certainly super rigorous um
00:38:23 rigorous control oh sorry machine learning people i just think deep learning makes it so easy
00:38:30 to do some things that our next generation are not immediately rewarded for going through some of the more
00:38:39 rigorous approaches and i wonder where that takes us i just well i'm actually optimistic
00:38:44 about it i just want to do my part to try to steer that rigorous thinking so there's like two questions i want to ask
00:38:54 do you have sort of a good example of rigorous thinking where it's easy to get lazy
00:39:01 and not do the rigorous thinking and the other question i have is like do you have advice
00:39:08 of how to practice rigorous thinking and you know in all the computer science disciplines that we've mentioned
00:39:20 yeah i mean there are times where problems that can be solved with well-known mature methods
00:39:28 could also be solved with with a deep learning there's an argument that you must use learning even for the parts we already
00:39:39 think we know because if the human has touched it then you've if you've biased the system
00:39:42 and you've suddenly put a bottleneck in there that is your own mental model but
00:39:48 something like inverting a matrix you know i i think we know how to do that pretty well even if it's a pretty big
00:39:52 matrix and we understand that pretty well and you could train a deep network to do it
00:39:57 but you shouldn't probably so so in that sense rigorous thinking is  understanding the the scope and the
00:40:05 limitations of the mess of the methods that we have like how to use the tools
00:40:11 of mathematics properly yeah i think you know taking a class on analysis is all i'm sort of arguing is to take
00:40:19 take a chance to stop and and force yourself to think rigorously about even
00:40:24 you know the rational numbers or something you know it doesn't have to be the end-all problem but that exercise of
00:40:32 clear thinking i think  goes a long way and i just want to make sure we we keep preaching don't lose it yeah
00:40:38 but do you think  when you're doing like rigorous thinking or like maybe  trying to write down equations or
00:40:46 sort of explicitly like formally describe a system do you think we naturally simplify
00:40:51 things too much is that a danger you run into like  in order to be able to understand
00:40:56 something about the system mathematically we  make it too much of a toy example but i think that's the good stuff right
00:41:05 that's how you understand the fundamentals i think so i think maybe even that's a key to intelligence or something but
00:41:13 i mean okay what if newton and galileo had deep learning and and they had done a bunch of experiments
00:41:20 and they told the world here's your weights of your neural network i've we've solved the problem
00:41:25 yeah you know where would we be today i don't i don't think we'd be as far as we as we are there's something to be
00:41:30 said about having a the simplest explanation for a phenomenon so i don't doubt that we can train neural networks to predict even
00:41:46 f equals m a type equations but i maybe i want another newton to come along
00:41:52 because i think there's more to do in terms of coming up with the simple models for
00:42:01 more complicated tasks yeah  let's not offend the ai systems from 50 years from
00:42:06 now that are listening to this that are probably better at might be better coming up with f equals
00:42:12 m a equations themselves so sorry i actually think learning is probably a route
00:42:20 to achieving this but the representation matters right and i think having a function that takes my inputs to outputs
00:42:29 that is arbitrarily complex may not be the end goal i think there's still you know the most
00:42:35 simple or parsimonious explanation for the data simple doesn't mean low dimensional
00:42:40 that's one thing i think that we've a lesson that we've learned so you know a standard way to do
00:42:47 model reduction or system identification and controls is to the typical formulation is that you try
00:42:51 to find the minimal state dimension realization of a system that hits some error bounds or something like
00:42:58 that and that's maybe not i think we're we're learning that that was that the
00:43:05 state dimension is not the right metric of complexity of complexity but for me i think a lot about contact
00:43:11 the mechanics of contact the robot hand is picking up an object or something and when i write down the equations of
00:43:17 motion for that they're they look actually not so much because of the dynamics of the hand when it's moving
00:43:28 but it's just the interactions and when they turn on and off right so having a high dimensional you
00:43:33 know but simple description of what's happening out here is fine but if when i actually
00:43:39 start touching i write down a different dynamical system for every
00:43:45 polygon on my robot hand and every polygon on the object whether it's in contact or not
00:43:50 with all the combinatorics that explodes there then that's too complex so i need to somehow summarize that with a
00:44:02 way of thinking and yeah i'm very optimistic that machine learning will get us there
00:44:08 first of all i mean i'll probably do it in the introduction but you're one of the great robotics people at mit
00:44:14 you're a professor at mit you've teach them a lot of amazing courses you
00:44:20 run a large group and you have a important history for mit i think as being a part of the darpa robotics challenge
00:44:29 can you maybe first say what is the dark robotics challenge and then tell your story around it your journey
00:44:39 with it yeah sure so the darpa robotics challenge it came on the tales of the darpa
00:44:45 grand challenge and darpa urban challenge which were the challenges that brought us put a
00:44:52 spotlight on self-driving cars guild pratt was at darpa and pitched a new challenge that involved
00:45:04 disaster response it didn't explicitly require humanoids although humanoids came into the picture
00:45:11 this happened shortly after the fukushima disaster in japan and our challenge was motivated
00:45:17 roughly by that because that was a case where if we had had robots that were ready to be sent in
00:45:24 there's a chance that we could have averted disaster and certainly after the in the
00:45:30 disaster response there were times we would love we would have loved to have sent robots in
00:45:36 so in practice what we ended up with was grand challenge a darpa robotics challenge where boston dynamics was
00:45:49 was to make humanoid robots people like me and the the amazing team at mit were competing first in a simulation challenge
00:45:58 to try to be one of the ones that wins the right to work on one of the  the boston dynamics
00:46:04 humanoids in order to compete in the the final challenge which was a physical challenge
00:46:10 and at that point it was already so it was decided as humanoid robots there were there were two tracks there
00:46:16 you could enter as a hardware team where you brought your own robot or you could enter through the virtual
00:46:22 robotics challenge as a software team that would try to win the right to use one of the boston dynamics robots which
00:46:26 are called atlas atlas humanoid robots yeah it was a 400-pound
00:46:33 marvel but a you know pretty big scary looking robot expensive too expensive at the time yeah
00:46:42 okay so  i mean how did you feel at the prospect of this kind of challenge i mean it seems
00:46:49 you know autonomous vehicles yeah i guess that sounds hard but  not really from a robotics
00:46:54 perspective it's like didn't they do in the 80s is the kind of feeling i would have
00:46:59  like when you first look at the problem it's on wheels but like humanoid robots
00:47:08 that sounds really hard so what like what are your the psychologically speaking what were you
00:47:14 feeling excited scared why the heck did you get yourself involved in this kind of
00:47:21 messy challenge we didn't really know for sure what we were signing up for in the sense
00:47:26 that you could have something that as it was described in the call for participation that could have put a huge emphasis on
00:47:34 the dynamics of walking and not falling down and walking over rough terrain or the same description
00:47:39 because the robot had to go into this disaster area and turn valves and and pick up a drill
00:47:45 cut the hole through a wall it had to do some interesting things the challenge could have really
00:47:52 highlighted perception and autonomous planning or it ended up that you know locomoting over a complex
00:48:02 terrain played a pretty big role in the competition so and the degree of autonomy wasn't clear the decree of autonomy was always a
00:48:11 central part of the discussion so what wasn't clear was how we would be able how far we'd be able to get with it
00:48:20 so the idea was always that you want semi-autonomy that you want the robot to have enough compute that you can have a degraded
00:48:28 network link to a human and so the same way you we had degraded networks at many natural disasters you'd send
00:48:34 your robot in you'd be able to get a few bits back and forth but you don't get to have enough
00:48:40 potentially to fully  operate the robot in every joint of the robot
00:48:46 so and then the question was and the gamesmanship of the organizers was to figure out what we're
00:48:52 capable of push us as far as we could so that it would differentiate the teams that
00:48:58 put more autonomy on the robot and had a few clicks and just said go there do this go there do this versus someone
00:49:02 who's picking every footstep or something like that so what were some memories
00:49:13 painful triumphant from the experience like what was that journey maybe if you can dig in a little deeper maybe
00:49:19 even on the technical side and the team side that that whole process of from the early idea stages to actually competing
00:49:29 i mean this was a defining experience for me i i it was it came at the right time for me
00:49:35 in my career i had gotten tenure before i was do a sabbatical and most people do
00:49:39 something you know relaxing and restorative for a sabbatical so you got tenure before the
00:49:46 the before this yeah yeah yeah it was a good time for me i had i had we had a bunch of algorithms
00:49:51 that we were very happy with we wanted to see how far we could push them and this was a chance to really test our metal
00:49:57 to do more proper software engineering the team we all just worked our butts off we you know we're in that lab almost all
00:50:09 okay so i mean there were some of course high highs and low lows throughout that anytime you're you know
00:50:14 not sleeping and devoting your life to a 400 pound humanoid um
00:50:20 i remember actually one funny moment where we're all super tired and so atlas had to walk across cinder
00:50:26 blocks that was one of the obstacles and i remember atlas was powered down and hanging limp you know on the on its harness
00:50:32 and the the humans were there like laying you know picking up and laying the brick down so that the robot could
00:50:37 walk over it and i thought what is wrong with this you know we've got a robot just watching us do all the manual labor
00:50:44 so that it can take its little i mean even the even the virtual robotics challenge was was
00:50:54 super nerve-wracking and dramatic i remember so so we were using gazebo as a simulator  on the cloud there was all these
00:51:04 interesting challenges i think the investment that that osrs fc whatever they were called at that
00:51:11 time brian gerkey's team at open source robotics they were pushing on the capabilities of gazebo in order to scale it to the complexity
00:51:21 of these challenges so you know up to the virtual competition so the virtual competition
00:51:28 was you will sign on at a certain time and we'll have a network connection to another machine on the cloud that is running the
00:51:34 simulator of your robot and your controller will run on this this controller this computer and and
00:51:40 the physics will run on the other and you have to connect now the physics they wanted it to run
00:51:47 at real-time rates because there was an element of human interaction and humans
00:51:53 could if you do want to tell the op it works way better if it's at frame rate oh cool but it was very hard
00:51:59 to simulate these comple these complex scenes at real-time rate so right up to like days before the competition
00:52:09 the the simulator wasn't quite at real time rate and that was great for me because my controller was solving a
00:52:16 big pretty big optimization problem and it wasn't quite at real-time rate so i was fine i was keeping up with the
00:52:21 simulator we were both running at about and i remember getting this email and by the way the perception
00:52:29 folks on our team hated that that they knew that if my controller was too slow the robot was going to fall down and and
00:52:33 you know no matter how good their perception system was if i can't make my controller fast
00:52:38 anyways we get this email like three days before the virtual competition well you know it's for all the marbles we're
00:52:43 going to either get a humanoid robot or we're not and we get an email saying good news
00:52:47 we made the robot does the simulator faster it's now one point and  yeah we're i was just like oh man
00:52:55 what are we going to do here so yeah that came in late at night for me a few days ahead a few days ahead
00:53:03 i went over there was it happened that frank permentor who's a a very very sharp he's a he was a
00:53:08 student at the time working on optimization was he was still in lab
00:53:15  frank we need to make this quadratic programming solver faster not like a little faster it's actually
00:53:20 you know and we wrote a new solver for that qp together that night
00:53:29 and you start terrifying so there's a really hard optimization problem that you're constantly solving you
00:53:36 didn't make the optimization problem simpler you you wrote any solver so i mean your observation is almost spot on well
00:53:43 what we did was what everybody i mean people know how to do this but we had not yet done
00:53:49 this idea of warm starting so we are solving a big optimization problem at every time step but if you're running
00:53:55 fast enough the optimization problem you're solving on the last time step is pretty similar to the
00:53:59 optimization you're going to solve with the next we had course had told our commercial
00:54:03 solver to use warm starting but even the interface to that commercial solver
00:54:10 was causing us these delays so what we did was we basically wrote we called it fastqp at the time
00:54:17 we wrote a very lightweight very fast layer which would basically check if nearby solutions to the quadratic program
00:54:26 were which were very easily checked  could stabilize the robot and if they couldn't we would fall back
00:54:31 to the solver you couldn't really test this well right or like i mean so we always knew that
00:54:36 if we fell back if we it got to the point where if for some reason
00:54:41 things slowed down and we fell back to the original solver the robot would actually literally fall down
00:54:48 so it was it was a harrowing sort of edge we're ledge we were sort of on but
00:54:54 i mean actually like the the 400 pound humor could come crashing to the ground if you if you
00:54:59 if your solver is not fast enough but you know that we have lots of good experiences so can i ask you a weird question i
00:55:09 i get about idea of hard work so actually people like students of yours that i've
00:55:15 interacted with and just and robotics people in general but they  they have
00:55:25 moments at moments have worked harder than  most people i know in terms of if you look at different disciplines of how
00:55:32 hard people work but they're also like the happiest like just like
00:55:38 i don't know it's the same thing with like running people that push themselves to like the limit
00:55:43 they all also seem to be like the most like full of life somehow  and i get often criticized like
00:55:50 you're not getting enough sleep what are you doing to your body blah blah blah like this kind of stuff and
00:55:57 i usually just kind of respond like i'm i'm doing what i love i'm passionate about i love it i
00:56:03 feel like it's it's invigorating i actually think i don't think the lack of sleep
00:56:09 is what hurts you i think what hurts you is  stress and lack of doing things that you're passionate about
00:56:15 but in this world yeah i mean can you comment about  why the heck robotics people
00:56:23 are  willing to push themselves to that degree is there value in that
00:56:30 and why are they so happy i think i think you got it right i mean i think the causality is not
00:56:36 that we work hard and i think other disciplines work very hard too but it's i don't think it's
00:56:42 that we work hard and therefore we are happy i think we found something that we're truly passionate about
00:56:51 it makes us very happy and then we get a little involved with it and spend a lot of time on it um
00:56:56 what a luxury to have something that you want to spend all your time on right we could talk about this for many
00:57:01 hours but maybe if we could pick is there something on the technical side on the approach
00:57:08 you took that's interesting that turned out to be a terrible failure or a success that you carry into your work today
00:57:16 about all the different ideas that were involved in making whether in the in the simulation or in the in the real world
00:57:26 making this semi-autonomous system work i mean it really did teach me something fundamental about what it's
00:57:33 going to take to get robustness out of a system of this complexity i would say the darpa challenge really
00:57:41 was foundational in my thinking i think the autonomous driving community thinks about this i think lots of
00:57:46 people thinking about safety critical systems that might have machine learning in the loop
00:57:50 are thinking about these questions for me the darpa challenge was the moment where i realized you know
00:57:56 we've spent every waking minute running this robot and again the in for the physical
00:58:02 competition days before the competition we saw the robot fall down in a way it had never fallen down before i thought
00:58:09 you know how could we have found that you know we only have one robot it's running almost all the time
00:58:14 we just didn't have enough hours in the day to test that robot something has to change right and then i
00:58:20 think that i mean i would say that the team that won was was from kaist was the team that had
00:58:29 two robots and was able to do not only incredible engineering just absolutely top-rate engineering but also they were
00:58:34 able to test at a rate and discipline that we didn't keep up with
00:58:41 what does testing look like what are we talking about here like what's what's a a loop of test like a
00:58:48 from start to finish what is a loop of testing yeah i mean i think there's a whole philosophy to testing
00:58:53 there's the unit tests and you can do that on a hardware you can do that in a small piece of code
00:58:57 you write one function you should write a test that that checks that function's input
00:59:01 outputs you should also write an integration test at the other extreme of of running the whole system together you
00:59:06 know where that that try to turn on all the different functions that you've
00:59:11 you think are correct it's much harder to write the specifications for a system level test
00:59:16 especially if that system is as complicated as a humanoid robot but the philosophy is sort of the same
00:59:23 i'm the real robot it's it's no different but on a real robot it's impossible to run the same
00:59:28 experiment twice so if you if you see a failure you hope you caught something in the
00:59:35 logs that tell you what happened but you'd probably never be able to run exactly that experiment again
00:59:42 and right now i think our philosophy is just basically monte carlo estimation is just
00:59:51 run as many experiments as we can maybe try to set up the environment to to make the things we are worried about
01:00:00 happen as often as possible but really we're relying on somewhat random search in order to test
01:00:05 maybe that's all we'll ever be able to but i think  you know because there's an argument
01:00:10 that the things that will get you are the the things that are really nuanced in the world and it'd be very hard to for
01:00:16 instance put back in a simulation yeah the i guess the edge cases what was the the hardest thing like so
01:00:23 you said walking over rough terrain like the just taking footsteps i mean people there's it's so dramatic
01:00:32 and painful in a certain kind of way to watch these videos from the drc of robots falling
01:00:39 yep it's just so heartbreaking i don't know maybe it's because for me at least we anthropomorphize the robot
01:00:47 of course there's everything funny for some reason like humans falling is funny  for i don't it's some dark reason i'm
01:00:54 not sure why it is so but it's also like tragic and painful and  so speaking of which i mean what
01:01:03 what made the robots fall and fail  in your view so i can tell you exactly what happened on our we i
01:01:08 contributed one of those our team contributed one of those spectacular falls every one of those falls the has a
01:01:15 complicated story i mean one time the power effectively went out on the robot
01:01:21 because it had been sitting at the door waiting for a green light to be able to proceed and its batteries you know and therefore
01:01:27 it just fell backwards and smashed its head across ground and it was hilarious but it
01:01:32 wasn't because of bad software right but for ours so the hardest part of the challenge the hardest task
01:01:39 in my view was getting out of the polaris it was actually relatively easy to drive the polaris we have
01:01:46 can you tell the stars no the story of the car people should watch this video i mean
01:01:53 the the the thing you've come up with is just brilliant but  anyway sorry what's 
01:01:57 yeah we we kind of joke we call it the big robot little car problem because somehow the race organizers decided
01:02:05 to give us a 400 pound humanoid and they also provided the vehicle which was a little polaris and the robot
01:02:12 didn't really fit in the car so you couldn't drive the car with your feet under the steering column
01:02:19 we actually had to straddle the the main column of the  and have basically one foot in the passenger seat one foot in
01:02:26 the driver's seat and then drive with our left hand but the hard part was we had to then park the car
01:02:33 get out of the car  it didn't have a door that was okay but it's just  getting up from crouched
01:02:38 from sitting when you're in this very constrained environment  first of all
01:02:44 i remember after watching those videos i was much more cognizant of how hard is it it is for me to get in
01:02:49 and out of the car and out of the car especially like it's actually a really difficult control problem
01:02:57 yeah and i i'm very cognizant of it when i'm like injured for whatever reason it's really
01:03:01 hard yeah so so how did you how did you approach so so we had a
01:03:07 you know you think of nasa's operations and they have these checklists you know pre-launch checklists and
01:03:12 they're like we weren't far off from that we had this big checklist and on the first day of the competition we
01:03:17 were running down our checklist and one of the things we had to do we had to turn off the controller the
01:03:23 piece of software that was running that would drive the left foot of the robot in order to accelerate on the gas
01:03:29 and then we turned on our balancing controller and the nerves jitters of the first day of
01:03:34 the competition someone forgot to check that box and turn that controller off so we used a lot of motion planning
01:03:44 to figure out a a sort of configuration of the robot that we get up and and over we relied heavily on our
01:03:50 balancing controller and and basically there was when the robot was in one of its most
01:03:56 precarious you know sort of configurations trying to sneak its big leg out of the out of the side
01:04:03 the other controller that thought it was still driving told its left foot to go like this and 
01:04:11 and that wasn't good but but it turned disastrous for us because what happened was a little
01:04:17 bit of push here actually if you we have videos of us you know running into the robot with a
01:04:24 10-foot pole and it kind of will recover but this is a case where there's no space to recover so a lot of
01:04:30 our secondary balancing mechanisms about like take a step to recover they were all disabled because we were in the car
01:04:35 and there's no place to step so we're relying on our just lowest level reflexes
01:04:41 and even then i think just hitting the foot on the seat on the on the floor we probably could
01:04:45 have recovered from it but the thing that was bad that happened is when we did that and we
01:04:50 jostled a little bit the tailbone of our robot hat was only a little off the seat it hit the seat
01:04:56 and the other foot came off the ground just a little bit and nothing in our plans had ever told us what to do if your
01:05:03 butt's on the seat and your feet are in the air feeding air and then
01:05:09 the thing is once you get off the script things can go very wrong because even our state
01:05:14 estimation our system that was trying to collect all the data from the sensors and understand
01:05:18 what's happening with the robot it didn't know about this situation so it was predicting things that were just wrong
01:05:26 and then we did a violent shake and fell off in our  face first on out of the robot
01:05:32 but like into the destination that's true we fell in we got our point for egress
01:05:38 but so  is there any hope for that's interesting is there any hope for  atlas to be able to do something
01:05:44 when it's just on its butt and feet in the air absolutely so you can no so that's that is one of the big
01:05:52 challenges and i think it's still true you know boston dynamics and and animal and there's this incredible
01:05:59 work on on legged robots happening around the world most of them still are are very good at
01:06:08 the case where you're making contact with the world at your feet and they have typically point feet
01:06:12 relatively they're balls on their feet for instance if that if those robots get in a situation where
01:06:19 the elbow hits the wall or something like this that's a pretty different situation now they have
01:06:24 layers of mechanisms that will make i think the the more mature solutions have have ways in which the controller won't
01:06:31 do stupid things but a human for instance is able to leverage incidental contact in order to
01:06:37 accomplish a goal in fact i might if you push me i might actually put my hand out and make a new brand new contact
01:06:44 the feet of the robot are doing this on quadrupeds but we mostly in robotics are afraid of
01:06:50 contact on the rest of our body which is crazy there's this whole field of motion planning collision-free motion planning
01:06:59 and we write very complex algorithms so that the robot can dance around and make sure it doesn't touch
01:07:06 the world so people are just afraid of contact because contact is seen as a difficult
01:07:12 it's still a difficult control problem and sensing problem now you're a serious person  i'm a little bit of an idiot and i'm
01:07:23 going to ask you some dumb questions  so i do  i do martial arts  so like jiu jitsu there's wrestled my
01:07:30 whole life so let me let me ask the question you know like whenever people learn that
01:07:37 i do any kind of ai or like i mention robots and things like that they say when am i gonna have
01:07:44 robots that you know that can win in a wrestling match or in a fight against a human so we just mentioned
01:07:51 sitting on your butt if you in the air that's a common position jiu jitsu when you're on the
01:07:56 ground you're when you're down opponent like what how difficult do you think is the problem
01:08:05 and when will we have a robot that can defeat a human in a wrestling match and we're talking about a lot like if i
01:08:11 don't know if you're familiar with wrestling but essentially not very
01:08:19 it's basically the art of contact it's like it's because you're you're you're picking contact points
01:08:28 and then using like leverage like to  off balance to to trick people like you  make them feel like you're
01:08:35 doing one thing and then they they change their balance and then you  switch what you're doing
01:08:41 and then results in a throw or whatever so like it's basically the art of
01:08:49 multiple contacts so awesome that's a nice description of it so there's also an opponent in there
01:08:54 right so so if very dynamic right if you are wrestling a human and  are
01:09:02 in a game theoretic situation with a human that's still hard
01:09:08 but just to speak to the you know quickly reasoning about contact part of it for instance yeah maybe even
01:09:13 throwing the game theory out of it almost like  yeah almost like a non-dynamic opponent
01:09:19 right there's reasons to be optimistic but i think our best understanding of those problems are
01:09:24 still pretty hard i have been increasingly focused on manipulation partly where that's a case
01:09:32 where the contact has to be much more rich and there are some really impressive examples of of deep learning
01:09:43 policies controllers that that can appear to do good things through contact
01:09:51 we've even got new examples of of you know deep learning models of predicting what's going to happen to
01:09:56 objects as they go through contact but i think the challenge you just offered there
01:10:02 still eludes us right the ability to make a decision based on those models quickly you know i have to think though it's
01:10:10 hard for humans too when you get that complicated i think probably you had maybe a slow-motion version of
01:10:17 where you learn the basic skills and you've probably gotten better at it and and
01:10:24 there's there's much more subtlety but it might still be hard to actually you know
01:10:31 really on the fly take a you know model of your humanoid and figure out how to how to plan the optimal sequence that
01:10:36 might be a problem we never solve well the rapid the i mean one of the most amazing
01:10:40 things to me about the we could talk about martial arts  we could also talk about dancing
01:10:48 it doesn't really matter too human i think it's the most interesting study of contact it's not even the dynamic
01:10:53 element of it it's the like when you get good at it it's so effortless like i can just
01:11:01 i'm very cognizant of the entirety of the learning process being essentially like learning how to
01:11:07 move my body in a way that i could throw very large weights around effortlessly
01:11:18 like and and i can feel the learning like i'm a huge believer in drilling of techniques and you can just like feel your i don't
01:11:24 you're not feeling you're feeling sorry you're learning it intellectually a little bit but a lot of
01:11:31 it is the body learning it somehow  like instinctually and whatever that learning is
01:11:38 that's really i'm not even sure if that's equivalent to  like a deep learning learning a controller i
01:11:46 think it's something more it feels like there's a lot of distributed learning going on
01:11:53 yeah i think there's hierarchy and composition yeah probably in the systems that we don't capture very well yet  you have layers
01:12:03 of control systems you have reflexes at the bottom layer and you have a you know a system that's capable of
01:12:10 planning a vacation to some distant country which is probably you probably don't have a
01:12:16 controller a policy for every possible destination you'll ever pick right but there's something magical in the in between
01:12:25 and how do you go from these low-level feedback loops to something that feels like a pretty complex set of outcomes
01:12:34 you know my guess is i think i think there's evidence that you can plan at some of these levels
01:12:39 right so  josh tenenbaum just showed it in his talk the other day he's got a game he likes to talk about
01:12:45 i think he calls it the pick 3 game or something where he puts a bunch of clutter down in front of a person
01:12:52 and he says okay pick three objects and it might be a telephone or a shoe or a kleenex box or
01:13:01 whatever and apparently you pick three items and then you pick he says okay pick the
01:13:04 first one up with your right hand the second one up with your left hand now using those objects those now as
01:13:10 tools pick up the third object of physics and mechanics and contact mechanics that
01:13:20 that i think we do learning we do have policies for we do control for almost feedback but somehow we're able
01:13:27 to still i mean i've never picked up a telephone with a shoe and a water bottle before and somehow
01:13:32 and it takes me a little longer to do that the first time but most of the time we can sort of
01:13:41 yeah i think the amazing thing is this ability to be flexible with our models plan when we need to
01:13:48 use our well-oiled controllers when we don't when we're in familiar territory having models i think the the other
01:13:57 thing you just said was something about i think your awareness of what's happening is even changing as you as you get
01:14:03 as you improve your expertise right so maybe you have a very approximate model of the mechanics to begin with and as
01:14:08 you gain expertise you get a more refined version of that model you're aware of
01:14:17 muscles or balance components that you just weren't even aware of before so how do you scaffold that
01:14:24 yeah plus the fear of injury the ambition of goals of excelling and  fear of mortality
01:14:33 let's see what else is in there as the motivations  overinflated ego in the beginning  like and then a crash of confidence
01:14:42 in the middle all of those seem to be essential for the learning process
01:14:48 and also and if all that's good then you're probably optimizing energy efficiency yeah right so we have to get that right
01:14:54  so you know there was this idea that you would have
01:15:01  robots play soccer better than human players by 2050 that was the goal  world basically was the goal to beat
01:15:10 world champion team to become a world cup be like a world cup right level team so are we gonna see
01:15:17 that first or a robot if you're familiar there's an organization called ufc
01:15:23 for mixed martial arts are we going to see a world cup championship soccer team out of robots or a ufc champion
01:15:33 mixed martial artist  that's a robot i mean it's very hard to to say one thing is a harder
01:15:38 one some problems harder than the other what probably matters is who who who started the organization
01:15:45 that that i mean i think robocup has a pretty serious following and there is a history now of people playing that
01:15:51 game learning about that game building robots to play that game building increasingly more human robots
01:15:58 it's got momentum and so if you want to  to have mixed martial arts compete you better start your
01:16:05 start your organization now right i think almost independent of which problem is technically harder because they're
01:16:11 both hard and they're both different that's a good point i mean those videos are just hilarious like 
01:16:18 especially the humanoid robots trying to trying to play soccer i mean they're kind of terrible right
01:16:24 now i mean i guess there is robo sumo wrestling there's like the robo one competitions
01:16:30 where they do have these robots that go on the table and basically fight so maybe i'm wrong
01:16:35 maybe first of all do you have a year in mind for  robocup just from a robotics perspective
01:16:41 it seems like a super exciting possibility that like in the physical space this is what's interesting i think
01:16:50 the world is captivated i think it's really exciting it's it inspires a huge number of people when
01:17:00 a machine beats a human at a game that humans are really damn good at so you're talking about chess
01:17:05 and go but that's in the in the world of  digital i don't think
01:17:14 machines have beat humans at a game in the physical space yet but that would be just you have to make the rules very
01:17:20 carefully right i mean if if atlas kicked me in the shins i'm down and  you know
01:17:27 and and game over so there's you know it's it's very subtle on yeah i think that's fair i think the fighting one is a weird
01:17:33 one yeah because  you're talking about a machine that's much stronger than you but
01:17:39 yeah in terms of soccer basketball all those kinds of soccer right i mean as soon as there's contact
01:17:44 or whatever and there's there are some things that the robot will do better i think if you really set yourself up to try to see
01:17:53 could robots win the game of soccer as the rules were written the right thing for the robot to do is
01:17:58 to play very differently than a human would play it's you're not going to get you know the perfect
01:18:04 soccer player robot you're going to get something that exploits the rules exploits its super
01:18:12 actuators it's super low bandwidth you know feedback loops or whatever and it's going to play the game differently
01:18:17 than you want it to play yeah and it i bet there's ways there's i bet there's loopholes
01:18:23 right we saw that in the in the darpa challenge that that it's very hard to write a set of rules that someone can't find
01:18:33  a way to exploit let me ask another ridiculous question i promise i think this might be the last
01:18:38 ridiculous question but i doubt it i i aspire to ask as many  ridiculous questions of  of a
01:18:47 brilliant mit professor okay  i don't know if you've seen the
01:18:54 black mirror it's funny i i never watched the episode i know when it happened though
01:19:01 because i gave a talk to some mit faculty one day on a unassuming you know monday or whatever i was telling about the
01:19:08 state of robotics and i showed some video of from boston dynamics of the quadruped
01:19:14 spot at the time it was the early version of spot and there was a look of horror that went
01:19:19 across the room and i said what you know i've shown videos like this a lot of times what
01:19:25 happened and it turns out that this video had gone yeah this black mirror episode had changed the way
01:19:30 people watched yeah the videos i was putting out the way they see these kinds of robots so
01:19:36 i talked to so many people who are just terrified because of that episode probably of these kinds of robots they
01:19:42 i almost want to say they almost kind of like enjoy being terrified i don't even know what it is about human
01:19:47 psychology that kind of imagine doomsday the destruction of the universe or our society and kind of
01:19:57 like enjoy being afraid i don't want to simplify it but it feels like they talk about it so often it almost
01:20:04 there does seem to be an addictive quality to it i talked to a guy that says this a guy named joe rogan
01:20:10 who's kind of the flag bearer for being terrified of these robots  do you have a two questions one do
01:20:19 you have an understanding of why people are afraid of robots and the second question is
01:20:25  in black mirror just to tell you the episode i don't even remember it that much anymore but these robots i think they
01:20:31 can shoot like a pellet or something they basically have it's basically a spot with a gun
01:20:40 and how far are we away from having robots that go rogue like that you know basically spot
01:20:48 that goes rogue for some reason and somehow finds a gun right so i mean i'm i'm not a psychologist
01:20:59 i think i don't know exactly why i think i think we have to be careful about the way robots influence our
01:21:10 society and the like i think that's something that's a responsibility that roboticists need to embrace i don't think
01:21:17 robots are going to come after me with a kitchen knife or a pellet gun right away and i mean if they were
01:21:23 programmed in such a way but i used to joke with atlas that all i had to do was run for five minutes
01:21:30 and it's battery would run out but  actually they've got a very big battery in there by the end so it was over an hour
01:21:39 i think the fear is a bit cultural though because i i mean you notice that like i think
01:21:46 in my age in the u.s we grew up watching terminator right if i had grown up at the same time in japan i probably would have been
01:21:52 watching astro boy and there's a very different reaction to robots in different countries right so i don't
01:21:59 know if it's a human innate fear of metal marvels or if it's something that we've done to ourselves
01:22:11 yeah the stories we tell ourselves through  through movies through just  through popular media
01:22:19 but if if i were to tell you know if if you were my therapist and i said i'm really terrified
01:22:27 that we're going to have these robots very soon that will hurt us making me feel better like
01:22:40 why shouldn't people be afraid there's a i think there's a video that went viral recently everything everything was spot
01:22:47 in boston today which goes viral in general but usually it's like really cool stuff like they're doing flips and stuff or
01:22:53 like sad stuff would be it's atlas being hit with a broomstick or something like that
01:23:00 but  there's a video where i think  one of the new production spot robots which are awesome
01:23:07 it was like patrolling somewhere in like in some country and like people immediately were like
01:23:13 saying like this is like the dystopian future like the surveillance state for some reason like you can just have a camera like
01:23:22 something about spot being able to walk on four feet with like really terrified people so
01:23:27 like what what do you say to those people i think there is a legitimate fear there because
01:23:37 so much of our future is uncertain but at the same time technically speaking it seems like we're not there yet
01:23:45 so what do you say i mean i think technology is complicated it can be used in many ways i think there are
01:23:57 attacks that somebody could use to do great damage maybe they have already you know i think
01:24:05  wheeled robots could be used in bad ways too i don't think that let's see
01:24:19 i don't want to be building technology just because i'm compelled to build
01:24:23 technology and i don't think about it but i would consider myself a technological optimist
01:24:30 i guess in the sense that i think we should continue to create and evolve and our
01:24:39 world will change and if we will introduce new challenges we'll screw something up maybe
01:24:46 but i think also we'll invent ourselves out of those challenges and life will go on so it's interesting because you didn't
01:24:52 mention like this is technically too hard i don't think robots are i think people
01:24:58 attribute a robot that looks like an animal as maybe having a level of self-awareness or consciousness or something that they
01:25:05 don't have yet right so it's not i think our ability to anthropomorphize those
01:25:13 robots is probably we're assuming that they have a level of intelligence that they don't yet have
01:25:20 and that might be part of the fear so in that sense it's too hard but um
01:25:25 you know there are many scary things in the world right so i think we're right to ask those
01:25:31 questions we're right to think about the implications of our work right in the in this in the short term
01:25:39 as we're working on it for sure is there something long-term that scares you about our future with ai and robots
01:25:51 a lot of folks from elon musk to sam harris to a lot of folks talk about the you know existential threats about
01:25:58 artificial intelligence oftentimes robots kind of inspire that the most
01:26:05 because of the anthropomorphism do you have any fears i actually i think i like rod brooks
01:26:15 answer maybe the best on this i think and it's not the only answer he's given over the years but
01:26:25 he says it's not going to be he's got a it's not going to be the robots versus the people we're all going to be robot people
01:26:37 because you know we already have smartphones some of us have serious technology implanted in our
01:26:43 bodies already whether we have a hearing aid or a pacemaker or anything like this
01:26:49 people with amputations might have prosthetics that's a trend i think that is likely to continue i mean this is now 
01:27:02 wild speculation but  i mean when do we get to cognitive implants and the like
01:27:08 and yeah with neurolink brain computer interfaces that's interesting so there's a there's a dance between humans and robots it's
01:27:18 it's going to be impossible to be scared of the other out there the robot because the robot will be part of us
01:27:27 essentially it'd be so intricately sort of part of our society that and it might not even be implanted
01:27:34 part of us but just it's so much a part of our yeah our society so in that sense the
01:27:39 smartphone is already the robot we should be afraid of yeah  i mean yeah and all the usual fears arise
01:27:52 manipulation all those kinds of things that that the problems are all the same
01:27:58 they're all they're human problems essentially it feels like yeah i mean i think the the way we
01:28:04 interact with each other online is changing the value we put on you know personal interaction and that's a crazy big
01:28:11 change that's going to happen and rip through our system has already been ripping through our society right
01:28:17 and that has implications that are massive i don't know if they should be scared of it or go with the flow but
01:28:25 i don't see you know some battle lines between humans and robots being the first thing to worry about i mean i
01:28:31 do want to just as a kind of comment maybe you can comment about your just feelings about
01:28:37 boston dynamics in general but you know i love science i love engineering i think there's so many
01:28:41 beautiful ideas in it and when i look at boston dynamics or legged robots in general i think
01:28:53 they inspire people curiosity and feelings in general excitement about engineering more than almost
01:29:00 anything else in popular culture and i think that's such an exciting plus like responsibility and possibility for robotics
01:29:09 and boston dynamics is riding that wave pretty damn well like they've found it they've discovered that
01:29:14 hunger and curiosity in the people and they're doing magic with it
01:29:19 i don't care if the i mean i guess their company have to make money right but  they're already doing incredible
01:29:25 work and inspiring the world about technology i mean do you have do you have thoughts about boston dynamics maybe
01:29:34 others your own work and robotics and inspiring the world in that way i completely agree i think
01:29:42 boston dynamics is absolutely awesome i think i show my kids those videos you know and the best thing that happens
01:29:49 is sometimes they've already seen them you know  right i think i i just think
01:29:55 it's a pinnacle of success in robotics that is just one of the best things that's
01:30:02 happened i absolutely completely agree one of the heartbreaking things to me is how many
01:30:09 robotics companies fail how hard it is to make money with the robotics company
01:30:16 like irobot like went through hell just to arrive at a roomba to figure out one product and then there's so many home
01:30:24 robotics companies like anki anki the cutest toy that's a great robot i
01:30:35 thought  went down i'm forgetting a bunch of them but a bunch of robotics rods company
01:30:42 rethink robotics like do you do you have any anything hopeful to say about the
01:30:50 possibility of making money with robots oh i think you can't just look at the failures you can all i mean boston
01:30:56 dynamics is a success there's lots of companies that are still doing amazingly good work in robotics
01:31:03 i mean this is the this is the capitalist ecology or something right i think you have many companies you have
01:31:09 many startups and they push each other forward and many of them fail and some of them get through and
01:31:13 that's sort of the natural way of things the way of those things i don't know that
01:31:20 is robotics really that much worse i i feel the pain that you feel too every time i
01:31:25 read one of these i sometimes it's friends and and i definitely wish it went better or would differently
01:31:35 but i think it's healthy and good to have bursts of ideas burst of activities ideas
01:31:41 if they are really aggressive they certainly that's the research mantra right if you're
01:31:50 succeeding at every problem you attempt then you're not choosing aggressively enough is it
01:31:55 exciting to you  the new spot oh it's okay it's so good what are you getting him as a pet
01:32:01  it yeah i mean i have to dig up 75k right now it's so cool that there's a price tag you can go
01:32:08 and and then actually buy it and i have a skydio r1  love it so um
01:32:16 no i would i would i would absolutely be a customer  i wonder what your kids would think
01:32:23 about i i actually zach from boston dynamics would let my kid drive in one of their demos one time
01:32:30 and  that was just so good so good and again forever be grateful for that
01:32:36 and there's something magical about the anthropomorphization of that arm it adds another level of human connection
01:32:45 i'm not sure we understand from a control aspect  the value of anthropomorphization i i think that's an understudied and
01:32:57 understood engineering problem there's been a psycho psychologists have been studying it i
01:33:01 think it's part like manipulating our mind to believe things 
01:33:07 is a valuable engineering like this is another degree of freedom that can be controlled i like
01:33:15 you know there's something that humans seem to do or maybe my dangerous introspection is 
01:33:23 i think we are able to make very simple models that assume a lot about the world very quickly
01:33:30 and then  it takes us a lot more time like you're wrestling you know you probably thought you knew what you're doing with
01:33:35 wrestling and you were fairly functional as a complete wrestler and then you slowly got more expertise
01:33:41 so maybe it's natural that our first first level of defense against seeing a
01:33:48 new robot is to think of it in our existing models of how humans and animals behave
01:33:54 and it's just as you spend more time with it then you'll develop more sophisticated models that will
01:34:01 appreciate the differences exactly can you say what does it take to control a robot
01:34:07 like what is the control problem of a robot and in general what is a robot in your view like how do you think of
01:34:14 this system what is a robot what is a robot i think robotics ridiculous questions no no it's
01:34:21 good i mean there's standard definitions of combining computation with some ability to do
01:34:28 mechanical work i think that gets us pretty close but i think robotics has this problem that once
01:34:37 things really work we don't call them robots anymore like your my dishwasher at home is
01:34:44 pretty sophisticated beautiful mechanisms there's actually a pretty good computer probably a couple chips in there doing
01:34:50 amazing things we don't think of that as a robot anymore which isn't fair because then what
01:34:54 roughly it means that robots robotics always has to solve the next problem and
01:34:59 doesn't get to celebrate its past successes i mean even factory room floor robots are super successful
01:35:09 they're amazing but that's not the ones i mean people think of them as robots but they don't
01:35:13 if you ask what are the successes of robotics somehow it doesn't come to your mind immediately
01:35:19 so the definition of robot is a system with some level automation that fails frequently
01:35:25 something like it's it's the computation plus mechanical work and unsolved problems
01:35:33 solve problem yeah so so from a perspective of control and mechanics dynamics what
01:35:41 what is a robot so there are many different types of robots the control that you need for a
01:35:48 a jibo robot you know some some robot that's sitting on your countertop and and interacting with you
01:35:53 but not touching you for instance is very different than what you need for an autonomous car or an autonomous
01:36:00 drone it's very different than what you need for a robot that's going to walk or pick things up with its hands right
01:36:08 my passion has always been for them places where you're interacting more you're doing more dynamic
01:36:16 interactions with the world so walking now manipulation and the control problems there
01:36:22 are are beautiful i think contact is one thing that differentiates them from many of the control problems
01:36:29 we've solved classically right like modern control grew up stabilizing fighter jets that were
01:36:34 passively unstable and there's like amazing success stories from control all over the place
01:36:40 power grid i mean there's all kinds of it's it's it's everywhere  that we don't even realize
01:36:45 just like ai is now so you mentioned contact like what's contact so an airplane
01:36:55 is of extremely complex system or a spacecraft landing or whatever but at least it has the luxury of
01:37:03 things change relatively continuously that's an oversimplification but if i make a small change in the command
01:37:09 i send to my actuator then the path that the robot will take tends to take a
01:37:16 change only by a small amount and there's a feedback mechanism here there's a feedback mechanism and
01:37:22 thinking about this as locally like a linear system for instance i can use
01:37:29 more linear algebra tools to study systems like that generalizations of linear algebra to to these
01:37:37 smooth systems what is contact the robot has something very discontinuous that happens when it makes or breaks
01:37:45 when it starts touching the world and even the way it touches or the order of contacts can change the outcome in potentially
01:37:54 unpredictable ways not unpredictable but complex ways i do think there's a little people a lot of people will say that
01:38:04 contact is hard in robotics even to simulate and i think there's a little bit of a
01:38:10 there's truth to that but but maybe a misunderstanding around that so what is limiting is that when we
01:38:20 think about our robots when we write our simulators we often make an assumption that that objects are rigid
01:38:28 and when it comes down you know that they that their mass moves all you know it stays in a constant position
01:38:34 relative to each other itself and and that leads to some paradoxes when you go to try to
01:38:41 talk about rigid body mechanics and contact and so for instance if i have a three-legged stool
01:38:50 with just a imagine it comes to a point at the at the leg so it's only touching the
01:38:54 world at a point if i draw my physics my high school physics diagram of this system then there's a
01:39:02 couple of things that i'm given by by elementary physics i know if the system if the table is at rest if it's
01:39:07 not moving it's zero velocities that means that the normal force
01:39:14 all the forces are in balance so the the force of gravity is being countered by the forces that the ground is pushing
01:39:22 on my table legs i also know since it's not rotating that there that the moments have to
01:39:27 balance and since it can in it's a three-dimensional table it could fall in any direction
01:39:33 it actually tells me uniquely what those three normal forces have to be if i have four legs on my table
01:39:41 four-legged table and they were perfectly machined to be exactly the right same height and
01:39:46 they're set down and the table's not moving then the basic conservation laws don't tell me
01:39:54 there are many solutions for the forces that the ground could be putting on my legs that would still result result in the
01:40:00 table not moving now the reason that seems fine i could just pick one
01:40:05 but it gets funny now because if you think about friction we what we think about with friction is we
01:40:11 our standard model says the amount of force that your that the table will push back if i were to now
01:40:18 try to push my table sideways i guess i have a table here is proportional to the normal force
01:40:25 so if i have if i'm very barely touching and i push i'll slide but if i'm pushing more and i push i'll slide less
01:40:32 it's called coulomb friction is our standard model now if you don't know what the normal
01:40:36 force is on the four legs and you push the table then you don't know what the friction forces are going to be
01:40:45 right and so you can't actually tell the laws just don't aren't explicit yet about which way the table is going to go
01:40:51 it could veer off to the left it could veer off to the right it could go straight so the rigid body assumption of contact
01:41:00 leaves us with some paradoxes which are annoying for for writing simulators and for writing controllers
01:41:08 we still do that sometimes because soft contact is potentially harder numerically or
01:41:14 whatever and the best simulators do both or do some combination of the two but but anyways because of these kind of
01:41:20 paradoxes there's all kinds of paradoxes in contact  mostly due to these rigid body assumptions
01:41:27 it becomes very hard to like write the same kind of control laws that we've been able to be successful
01:41:33 with for like fighter jets we haven't been as successful writing those controllers for
01:41:38 manipulation and so you don't know what's going to happen at the point of contact at the moment of contact there are
01:41:43 situations absolutely where you where our laws don't tell us so the standard approach that's okay
01:41:50 i mean instead of having a differential equation you end up with a differential inclusion it's called it's a set valued
01:41:57 equation it says that i'm in this configuration i have these forces applied on me and there's there's a set of
01:42:04 things that could happen right and and those aren't continuously i mean what
01:42:11  so when you're seeing like non-smooth they're not only not smooth but this is discontinuous the non-smooth comes in when i make or
01:42:20 break a new contact first or when i transition from stick to slip so you typically have static friction
01:42:26 and then you'll start sliding and that'll be a discontinuous change in in velocity for instance especially if
01:42:33 you come to rest or that's so fascinating okay so  so what do you
01:42:38 what do you  do sorry i interrupted what's the hope under so much uncertainty about what's going to happen
01:42:46 what are you supposed to do i mean control has an answer for this robust control is one approach
01:42:51 but but roughly you can write controllers which try to still perform the right task despite all
01:42:57 the things that could possibly happen the world might want the table to go this way in this way but if i write a controller
01:43:03 that pushes a little bit more and pushes a little bit i can certainly make the table go in the
01:43:07 direction i want it just puts a little bit more of a burden on the control system
01:43:14 right and this discontinuities do change the control system because the way we write it down
01:43:21 right now every different control con configuration including sticking or sliding or parts
01:43:29 of my body that are in contact or not looks like a different system and i think of them i reason about them
01:43:34 separately or differently and the combinatorics of that blow up right so i just don't have
01:43:41 enough time to compute all the possible contact configurations of my humanoid
01:43:48 interestingly i i mean i'm a humanoid i have lots of degrees of freedom lots of joints
01:43:54 i only i've only been around for a handful of years it's getting up there but i haven't had time in my life to visit
01:44:00 all of the states in my system certainly all the contact configurations so if step one is to consider every
01:44:10 possible contact configuration that i've i'll ever be in that's probably a that's probably not a problem i need to
01:44:16 solve right just as a small attention what's a contact configuration
01:44:23 what like just so we can  yeah enumerate what are we talking about yeah how many are there
01:44:29 the simplest example maybe would be imagine a robot with a flat foot and we think about the phases of gate
01:44:36 where the heel strikes and then the four the front toe strikes and then you can heal up toe off
01:44:45 those are each different contact configurations i only had two different contacts but i ended up with four different
01:44:52 contact configurations now of course i might have my my robot might actually have bumps on it or other things so it
01:44:59 could be much more subtle than that right but it's just even with one sort of box
01:45:04 interacting with the ground already in in the plane has that many right and if i was just even a 3d
01:45:10 foot then probably my left toe might touch just before my right toe and things get subtle now if i'm a dexterous hand
01:45:19 and i go to talk about just grabbing a water bottle if every if i have to enumerate every possible order
01:45:29 that my hand came into contact with the with the bottle then i'm dead in the water my any
01:45:34 approach that we were able to get away with that in walking because we mostly touch the ground
01:45:39 within a small number of points for instance and we haven't been able to get dextrous hands that way
01:45:49 so i mean you've mentioned that people think that contact is really hard and that that's the reason that
01:45:58 robotic manipulation is problem is really hard is there any flaws in that
01:46:09 thinking so i think simulating contact is one aspect i know people often say that we don't
01:46:14 that one of the reasons that we have a limit in robotics is because we do not simulate contact accurately
01:46:25 the extent to which that's true is partly because our simulators we haven't got mature enough simulators
01:46:32 there are some things that are still but but we actually we know what the governing equations are they have some foibles
01:46:45 like this indeterminacy but we should be able to simulate them accurately we have incredible open source community
01:46:52 in robotics but it actually just takes a professional engineering team a lot of work to write a very good
01:46:58 simulator like that  now where does i believe you've written drake
01:47:05 there's a team of people i certainly spend a lot of hours on it myself well what is drake and what what does
01:47:11 it take to to to create a simulation environment  for for the kind of difficult control
01:47:20 problems we're talking about right so drake is the simulator that that i've been working on
01:47:25 there are other good simulators out there i don't like to think of drake as just a simulator
01:47:31 because because we write our controllers in drake we write our perception systems a little bit in drake
01:47:36 but we write all of our our you know low level control and even planning and  optimization intelligence
01:47:42 optimization capabilities absolutely yeah i mean drake is three things roughly
01:47:49 it's an optimization library which is sits on it it provides a layer of abstraction in c
01:47:55 plus and python for commercial solvers you can write linear programs quadratic programs you know semi-definite programs sums of
01:48:03 squares programs the ones we've used mixed integer programs and it will do the work to
01:48:08 curate those and send them to whatever the right solver is for instance and it provides a level of abstraction
01:48:16 the second thing is is a system modeling language a bit like labview or simulink where you can make block diagrams out of complex
01:48:26 systems or it's like ross in that sense where you might have lots of ross nodes that are each doing some part of your system
01:48:37 we try to write if you write a drake system then you have to it asks you to describe a little bit
01:48:42 more about the system if you have any state for instance in the system there any variables that are
01:48:48 going to persist you have to declare them parameters can be declared and the like but the
01:48:54 advantage of doing that is that you can if you like run things all on one process but you
01:48:58 can also do control design against it you can do i mean simple things like
01:49:05 rewinding and playing back your your your simulations for instance you know these things you get some rewards for
01:49:11 spending a little bit more upfront cost in describing each system and and i i was inspired to do that
01:49:19 because i think the complexity of atlas for instance is just so great and i think although
01:49:24 i mean ross has been incredible absolutely huge fan of what it's done for the
01:49:33 robotics community but it the ability to rapidly put different pieces together and have a functioning
01:49:40 thing is very good but i do think that it's hard to think clearly about a bag of disparate
01:49:47 parts mr potato head kind of software stack and if you can you know ask a little bit more out of
01:49:54 each of those parts then you can understand the way they work better you can try to verify them
01:50:00 and the like you can do learning against them and then one of those systems the last
01:50:05 thing i i said the first two things that drake is but the last thing is that there is a set of
01:50:11 multi-body equations rigid body equations that is trying to provide a system that simulates physics
01:50:19 and that we also have renderers and other things but i think the physics component of drake is is special
01:50:24 in the sense that we have done excessive amount of engineering to to make sure that we've written the
01:50:32 equations correctly every possible tumbling satellite or spinning top or anything that we could possibly write as
01:50:37 a test is tested we are making some you know i think fundamental improvements on the way you
01:50:44 simulate contact yes what does it take to  simulate contact i mean it just seems 
01:50:52 i mean there's something just beautiful the way you were like explaining contact and you're like tapping your
01:50:58 fingers on the on the table while you're while you're doing it just easily right easily just like just not even like
01:51:08 it was like helping you think i guess what i see you have this like awesome demo of um
01:51:16 loading or unloading a dishwasher just picking up a plate  grasping it like for the first time
01:51:29 that's just seems like so difficult what how do you simulate any of that so it was really interesting that what
01:51:36 happened was that we started getting more professional about our software development during
01:51:43 the darpa robotics challenge i learned the value of software engineering and how these
01:51:49 how to bridle complexity i guess that's that's what i i want to somehow fight against and bring some of the
01:51:55 clear thinking of controls into these complex systems we're building for robots shortly after the darpa robotics challenge
01:52:05 toyota opened a research institute tri toyota research institute they put one of their there's there's
01:52:11 three locations one of them is just down the street from mit and  and i helped ramp that up
01:52:19  right out as a part of my  the end of my sabbatical i guess so so tri is 
01:52:29 has given me the tri robotics effort has made this investment in simulation in drake and michael sherman leads a
01:52:35 team there of just absolutely top notch dynamics experts that are trying to write those simulators
01:52:41 that can pick up the dishes and there's also a team working on manipulation there that is
01:52:47 taking problems like loading the dishwasher and we're using that to study these really hard corner cases kind of
01:52:55 problems in manipulation so for me this you know simulating the dishes we could actually write a
01:53:02 controller if we just cared about picking up dishes in the sink once we could write a controller without any
01:53:07 simulation whatsoever and we could call it done but we want to understand like
01:53:14 what is the path you take to actually get to a robot that could perform that for any dish
01:53:22  in anybody's kitchen with with enough confidence that it could be a commercial product right and and
01:53:28 it has deep learning perception in the loop it has complex dynamics in the loop it has controller it has a planner
01:53:34 and how do you take all of that complexity and put it through this engineering discipline and verification
01:53:44 and validation process to actually get enough confidence to deploy i mean the darpa challenge
01:53:50 made me realize that that's not something you throw over the fence and hope that somebody will harden it
01:53:55 for you that there are really fundamental challenges in  in closing that last gap they're
01:54:01 doing the validation and the testing i think it might even change the way we have to think about
01:54:09 the way we write systems what happens if you if you have the robot running lots of tests it and it
01:54:19 screws up it breaks a dish right how do you capture that i said you can't run the same simulation or the same
01:54:24 experiment twice in in a real on a real robot do we have to be able to bring that
01:54:32 one off exp failure back into simulation in order to change our controllers study it make sure it won't happen again
01:54:38 do we is it enough to just try to add that to our distribution
01:54:43 and understand that on average we're going to cover that situation again there's like really subtle questions at
01:54:50 the corner cases that i think we don't yet have satisfying answers for like how do you find the
01:54:54 corner cases that's one kind of is there do you think this possible to create a
01:55:02 systematized way of discovering corner cases efficiently yeah in whatever the problem is yes i mean i
01:55:10 think we have to get better at that i mean control theory has for for decades talked about active
01:55:21 so people call it curiosity these days it's roughly this idea of trying to exploration or exploitation but but in
01:55:28 the active experiment design is even is is more specific you could try to understand the uncertainty in your
01:55:35 system design the experiment that will provide the maximum information to reduce that uncertainty
01:55:41 if there's a parameter you want to learn about what is the optimal trajectory i could execute to learn
01:55:46 about that parameter for instance scaling that up to something that has a deep network in the
01:55:54 loop and the planning in the loop is tough we've done some work on you know with matt o'kelly and amancina we have
01:56:03 we've worked on some falsification algorithms that are trying to do rare event simulation that try to just hammer
01:56:07 on your simulator and if your simulator is good enough you can um
01:56:14 you can spend a lot of time or you can write good algorithms that try to spend most of their time in
01:56:19 the corner cases so you basically imagine you're you're building an autonomous car and you want
01:56:26 to put it in i don't know downtown new delhi all the time right an accelerated testing
01:56:33 if you can write sampling strategies which figure out where your controller is performing badly in simulation
01:56:38 and start generating lots of examples around that you know it's just the space of possible
01:56:45 places where that can be where things can go wrong is very big so it's hard to write those algorithms yeah
01:56:52 rare event simulation is just like a really compelling notion  if it's possible we joked and we
01:56:58 called we call it the black swan generator it's a black swan right because you don't just want the rare events you want
01:57:02 the ones that are highly impactful i mean that's the most those are the most sort of profound
01:57:10 questions we ask of our world like  what's the  what's the worst that can happen 
01:57:17 but what we're really asking isn't some kind of like computer science worst case analysis
01:57:24 we're asking like what are the millions of ways this can go wrong and that's like our curiosity
01:57:34 we humans i think are pretty bad at  we just like run into it and i think there's a distributed sense because
01:57:41 there's now like 7.5 billion of us and so there's a lot of them and then a lot of them write blog posts about the
01:57:47 stupid thing they've done so we learn in a distributed way there's there's something that's going to be important
01:57:53 for robots too yeah i mean that's that's another massive theme at toyota research for robotics is this fleet learning
01:58:01 concept is you know the idea that i as a humanoid don't have enough time to visit all of
01:58:08 my states right there's just a it's very hard for one robot to experience all the things
01:58:13 but that's not actually the problem we have to solve right we're gonna have fleets of robots that
01:58:20 can have very similar appendages and at some point maybe collectively they have
01:58:28 enough data that their computational processes should be set up differently than ours right
01:58:34 it's a have this vision of just i mean all these  dishwasher unloading robots
01:58:42 i mean that robot dropping a plate and a human looking at the robot probably pissed off
01:58:49 yeah but  that's a special moment to record i think one one thing in terms of fleet learning and i've seen that because i i've talked
01:58:57 to a lot of folks just like like tesla users or tesla drivers they're not another another company
01:59:04 that's using this kind of fleet learning idea and one hopeful thing i have about humans is they really enjoy when a system
01:59:14 improves learns so they enjoy fleet learning and they're the reason it's hopeful for me is
01:59:19 they're willing to put up with something that's kind of dumb right now and they're like
01:59:27 if it's improving they almost like enjoy being part of the like teaching it almost like we if you have kids like
01:59:32 you're teaching them something right i think that's a beautiful thing because that that gives me hope that we
01:59:37 can put dumb robots out there  as long i mean the problem with
01:59:43 on the tesla side with cars cars can kill you that's that makes the problem so much
01:59:48 harder dishwasher unloading is a little safe that's why home robotics is 
01:59:55 it's really exciting and just to clarify i mean for people who might not know a tri toyota research institute so they're
02:00:03  i mean they're they're pretty well known for like autonomous vehicle research but they're also interested in in
02:00:11 home robotics yep there's a big there's a big group working on multiple groups working on home robotics
02:00:16 it's a major part of the portfolio also there's also a couple other projects an
02:00:21 advanced materials discovery i'm using ai and machine learning to discover new materials for
02:00:27 for car batteries and then the like for instance yeah and that's been actually an incredibly
02:00:32 successful team  there's new projects starting up too so do you see a future of  where
02:00:39 like robots are in our home and and like robots that have like actuators that look like arms
02:00:47 in our home or like you know more like humanoid type robots or is this are we gonna is we're gonna
02:00:52 do the same thing that you just mentioned that you know the dishwasher is no longer a
02:00:56 robot we're going to just not even see them as robots but do i mean what's your
02:01:02 vision of the home of the future 10 20 years from now 50 years if you get crazy yeah i think
02:01:10 we already have roombas cruising around we have   you know alexa's or google homes
02:01:14 on their our kitchen counter it's only a matter of time till they spring arms and start
02:01:19 doing something useful like that so i do think it's coming i think it's lots
02:01:27 of people have lots of motivations for doing it it's been super interesting actually learning about
02:01:34 toyota's vision for it which is about because i think that's not necessarily the first entry the most lucrative
02:01:45 entry point but it's the problem maybe that we really need to solve no matter what and so i think i think there's a real
02:01:55 opportunity it's a delicate problem how do you work with people help people keep them active engaged you know
02:02:05 but improve their quality of life and  and and help them age in place for instance it's interesting because older folks are
02:02:13 also i mean there's a contrast there because they're not always the the folks who are
02:02:19 the most comfortable technology for example so there's a there's a there's a division that's interesting there that
02:02:28 you can do so much good with a robot for for older folks but there's a there's a gap to feel of understanding i mean
02:02:39 it's actually kind of beautiful robot is learning about the human and the human is kind of learning about this
02:02:48 new robot thing and it's  also with at least with  like when i talk to my parents about robots there's a little
02:02:52 bit of a blank slate there too like you can i mean they don't know anything
02:02:59 about robotics so it's completely like wide open they don't have that they haven't my
02:03:06 parents haven't seen black mirror so like they they there's it's a blank slate here's a cool thing like what can
02:03:11 you do for me yeah so it's an exciting space i think it's a really important space
02:03:19 i do feel like you know a few years ago  drones were successful enough in academia they kind of
02:03:25 broke out and started in industry and autonomous cars have been happening it does feel like manipulation
02:03:34 in logistics of course first but in the home shortly after seems like one of the next big things that's going to really
02:03:41 pop so  i don't think we talked about it but  what's soft robotics so we talked about
02:03:50 like rigid bodies like if we can just linger on this whole touch thing yeah so what's soft robotics
02:03:59 so i told you that i really dislike the fact that robots are afraid of touching the world
02:04:05 all over their body so there's a couple reasons for that if you look carefully at all the places
02:04:11 that robots actually do touch the world they're almost always soft they have some sort of pad on their fingers or a rubber
02:04:18 sole on their foot but if you look up and down the arm we're just pure aluminum or something
02:04:26 so  so that makes it hard actually in fact hitting the table with your you know your rigid arm or nearly rigid arm
02:04:34 is a is a has some of the problems that we talked about in terms of simulation i think it it
02:04:39 fundamentally changes the mechanics of contact when you're soft right you you turn point contacts into
02:04:46 patch contacts which can have torsional friction you can have distributed load if i want to pick up an egg
02:04:54 right if i pick it up with two points then in order to put enough force to sustain the weight of the egg i might have to
02:05:00 put a lot of force to break the egg if i envelop it with a with contact all all around then i can
02:05:05 distribute my force across the shell of the egg and have a better chance of not breaking it
02:05:12 so soft robotics is for me a lot about changing the mechanics of contact does it make the problem a
02:05:18 quite the opposite  it it changes the computational problem
02:05:29 i think because of the i think our world and our mathematics has biased us towards ridgid
02:05:35 but it really should make things better in some ways right it's it's a i think the the
02:05:44 the future is unwritten there but the other thing is ultimately sorry to interrupt they think
02:05:49 ultimately it will make things simpler if we embrace the softness of the world it makes
02:05:55 it makes things smoother right so the the result of small actions is less discontinuous but
02:06:03 it also means potentially less you know instantaneously bad
02:06:09 for instance i won't necessarily contact something and send it flying off the other aspect of it that just happens
02:06:16 to dovetail really well is that if soft robotics tends to be a place where we can embed a lot of sensors to
02:06:23 so if you change your your hardware and make it more soft then you can potentially have a tactile sensor which is
02:06:30 measuring the deformation so there's a team at tri that's working on soft hands and and you get so much more information
02:06:40 if you you can put a camera behind the skin roughly and and get fantastic tactile information
02:06:49 which is it's super important like in manipulation one of the things that really is frustrating is if you work super hard
02:06:54 on your head mounted on your perception system for your head mounted cameras and then you've
02:06:59 identified an object you reach down to touch it and the first the last thing that happens right before
02:07:04 the most important time you stick your hand and you're occluding your head mounted sensors right so in
02:07:10 all the part that really matters all of your off board sensors are you know are occluded
02:07:15 and really if you don't have tactile information then you're you're blind in an important way so
02:07:21 it happens that soft robotics and tactile sensing tend to go hand in hand i think we've
02:07:27 kind of talked about it but  you taught a course on under actuator robotics i believe that was the name of it
02:07:34 actually that's right can you talk about it in that context what is
02:07:41 under actuated robotics right so under-actuated robotics is my graduate course it's it's online
02:07:47 mostly now so i mean in the sense that the lecturer's versions of it i think right the youtube really great i
02:07:52 recommend it highly look on youtube for the 2020 versions until march and then you have to go back to 2019 thanks to
02:08:02 covet no i've poured my heart into that class and lecture one is basically explaining what the word underactuated
02:08:10 means so people are very kind to show up and then maybe have to learn what the title of
02:08:14 the course means over the course of the first lecture that that first lecture is really good
02:08:19 you should watch it it's it's a strange name but i thought it captured the essence of what
02:08:28 control was good at doing and what control was bad at doing so what do i mean by under actuated so
02:08:36 a mechanical system has many degrees of freedom for instance i think of a joint as a degree of freedom
02:08:45 and it has some number of actuators motors so if you have a robot that's bolted to the table
02:08:52 that has five degrees of freedom and five motors then you have a fully actuated robot
02:08:59 if you have if you take away one of those motors then you have an under actuated robot
02:09:04 now why on earth i i have a good friend who who likes to tease me he said russ if you
02:09:10 had more research funding would you work on fully actuated robots yeah and  the answer is no
02:09:17 the world gives us under-actuated robots whether we like it or not i'm a human i'm an under actuated robot even though
02:09:23 i have more muscles than my big degrees of freedom because i have in some places
02:09:29 multiple muscles attached to the same joint but still there's a really important degree of freedom that i have which is
02:09:36 the location of my center of mass in space for instance all right i'm i can jump into the air
02:09:44 and there's no motor that connects my center of mass to the ground in that case so i have to think about
02:09:49 these the implications of not having control over everything the passive dynamic walkers are the
02:09:57 extreme view of that where you've taken away all the motors and you have to let physics do the work
02:10:01 but it shows up in all the walking robots where you have to use some of the actuators to push and pull even the degrees of
02:10:08 freedom that you don't have an actuator on that's referring to walking if you're like falling forward
02:10:15 like is there a way to walk that's fully actuated so it's a subtle point when you're when you're in contact and you have your feet
02:10:25 on the ground there are still limits to what you can do right unless i have suction cups on my feet i
02:10:31 cannot accelerate my center of mass towards the ground faster than gravity because i can't get
02:10:36 a force pushing me down right but i can still do most of the things that i want to so you can get away
02:10:42 with basically thinking of the system as fully actuated unless you suddenly need it to accelerate down super fast
02:10:49 but as soon as i take a step i i get into more nuanced territory and to get to really
02:10:57 dynamic robots or airplanes or other things i think you have to embrace the under actuated dynamics manipulation people
02:11:05 think is manipulation under under actuated my even if my arm is fully actuated i have a motor if my
02:11:12 goal is to control the position and orientation of this cup then i don't have an actuator for that
02:11:20 directly so i have to use my actuators over here to control this thing now it gets even worse like what if i
02:11:27 have to button my shirt okay what are the degrees of freedom of my shirt right i suddenly
02:11:34 that's a hard question to think about it kind of makes me queasy as a thinking about my state-space control ideas
02:11:41 but actually those are the problems that make me so excited about manipulation right now is that it
02:11:48 it breaks some of the it breaks a lot of the foundational control stuff that i've been thinking about
02:11:53 is there what are some interesting insights you could say about trying to solve an under actuated
02:12:00 like control in in an underactuated system so i think the philosophy there is let physics do
02:12:10 more of the work the technical approach has been optimization so you typically formulate your decision making for control
02:12:17 as an optimization problem and you use the language of optimal control and sometimes numero often numerical
02:12:22 optimal control in order to make those decisions and balance you know these complicated equations of
02:12:30 and in order to control you don't have to use optimal control to do under-actuated
02:12:35 systems but that has been the technical approach that has borne the most fruit in our
02:12:41 at least in our line of work and there's some so in under actuator systems when you say let physics do some of the work
02:12:49 so there's a kind of feedback feedback loop that observes the state that the physics brought you to
02:12:56 so like you've there's a there's a perception there this is there's a feedback somehow do you do do you
02:13:04 ever loop in like complicated perception systems into this whole picture right right around the time of the darpa
02:13:10 challenge we had a complicated perception system in the darpa challenge we also started to embrace perception
02:13:15 for our flying vehicles at the time we had a a really good project
02:13:21 on trying to make airplanes fly at high speeds through forests sirtex caramel was on that
02:13:29 project and it was a really fun team to to work on he's carried it farther much farther
02:13:34 forward since then so that's using cameras for perception so that was using cameras  that was a
02:13:41 at the time we felt like lidar was too heavy to to be carried on on a light uav and we were using cameras
02:13:50 and that was a big part of it was just how do you do even stereo matching at a fast enough rate with a
02:13:56 small camera a small onboard compute since then we have now the so the deep learning
02:14:03 revolution unquestionably changed what we can do with perception for robotics and control so in manipulation
02:14:10 we can address we can use perception in a i think a much deeper way
02:14:17 and we get into not only i think the the first use of it naturally would be to ask your deep learning system to look at
02:14:24 the cameras and produce the state which is like the pose of my thing for instance
02:14:30 but i think we've quickly found out that that's not always the right thing to do why is that because
02:14:39 what's the state of my shirt imagine i've always very noisy i mean or it's um
02:14:45 if the first step of me trying to button my shirt is estimate the full state of my shirt including
02:14:50 like what's happening in the backyard or whatever whatever that's just not the right specification there are aspects of the
02:14:58 state that are very important to the task there are many that are unobservable and not not important to
02:15:05 the task so you really need it begs new questions about state representation another example
02:15:13 that we've been playing with in lab has been just the idea of chopping onions okay or carrots turns out to be better so
02:15:23 the onions stink up the lab  and they're hard to see in a camera but  so details matter yeah details matter
02:15:35 moving around a particular object right then i think about oh it's got a position or an orientation in space
02:15:39 that's the description i want now when i'm chopping an onion okay the first chop comes down
02:15:48 i have now a hundred pieces of onion does my control system really need to understand the position and orientation
02:15:53 and even the shape of the hundred pieces of onion in order to make a decision probably not you know and like if i keep
02:15:59 going i'm just getting more and more is my state space getting bigger as i cut it's it it it's not right
02:16:09 yes so there's a i think there's a richer  idea of state it's not the state that is given to us
02:16:17 by lagrangian mechanics there is a there is a proper lagrangian state of the system but the relevant
02:16:23 state for this is some latent state is what we call it in machine learning
02:16:31 but you know there's some some different state representatives some compressed representation some and
02:16:35 that's what i i worry about saying compressed because it doesn't i don't
02:16:42 mind that it's low dimensional or not but it has to be something that's easier to think about
02:16:50 by us humans or my algorithms or the algorithms being like control optimal so for instance if the contact mechanics
02:16:58 of all of those onion pieces and all the permutations of possible touches between those onion pieces
02:17:03 you know you can give me a high dimensional state representation i'm okay if it's
02:17:07 linear but if i have to think about all the possible shattering combinatorics of that then my robot is going to sit there
02:17:15 thinking and  the soup's gonna get cold or something so since you taught the course
02:17:22 i've it kind of entered my mind the idea of under actuated as really compelling to see the to see the
02:17:29 world in this kind of way do you ever you know if we talk about onions or you talk about
02:17:35 the world with people in it in general do you see the world as a basically an underactuated system
02:17:40 do you like often look at the world in this way or is this  overreach
02:17:49 under actuated as a way of life man exactly i guess that's what i'm asking i do think it's everywhere i think some
02:17:57 in some places we already have natural tools to deal with it
02:18:02 you know it rears its head i mean in linear systems it's not a problem we just we just
02:18:07 like an under actuated linear system is really not sufficiently distinct from a fully actuated
02:18:12 linear system it's it's a it's a subtle point about when that becomes a bottleneck and what we know how to do
02:18:17 with control it happens to be a bottleneck although we've gotten incredibly good solutions now but for a long time that i
02:18:25 felt that that was the key bottleneck in legged robots and roughly now the under actuated course is
02:18:32 you know me trying to tell people everything i can about how to make atlas do a backflip right
02:18:39 i have a second course now in that i teach in the other semesters which is on on manipulation and that's where we
02:18:46 get into now more of the that's a newer class i'm hoping to put it online this fall completely and  that's going to have
02:18:54 much more aspects about these perception problems and the state representation questions and then how do you do control
02:19:01 and the the thing that's a little bit sad is that  for me at least is there's a lot of manipulation tasks that people
02:19:09 want to do and should want to do they could start a company with it and make very successful that don't actually
02:19:15 require you to think that much about under or dynamics at all even but certainly under actuated dynamics
02:19:21 once i have if i if i reach out and grab something if it if i can sort of assume it's rigidly
02:19:26 attached to my hand then i can do a lot of interesting meaningful things with it without really ever thinking about the
02:19:32 dynamics of that object so they built we've built systems that kind of
02:19:39 reduced the need for that enveloping grasps and the like but i think the really good problems
02:19:45 in manipulation so manipulation by the way is more than just pick and
02:19:50 place that's like a lot of people think of that just grasping i don't mean that i mean buttoning my
02:19:57 shirt i mean tying shoe laces how do you program a robot to tie shoelaces and not just one shoe but
02:20:05 every shoe right that's a really good problem it's tempting to write down like the infinite dimensional state of the
02:20:14 of the laces that's probably not needed to write a good controller i know we could hand design a controller
02:20:19 that would do it but i don't want that i want to understand the principles
02:20:24 that would allow me to solve another problem that's kind of like that but i think if we can stay pure in our approach
02:20:33 then the challenge of tying anybody's shoes is a great challenge that's a great challenge i mean and the soft
02:20:40 touch comes into play there that's really interesting let me ask another ridiculous question
02:20:47 on this topic how important is touch we haven't talked much about humans
02:20:56 but i have this argument with my dad where like i think you can fall in love with the robot
02:21:03 based on  language alone and he believes that touch is essential i touch and smell he
02:21:08 says but so in terms of robots you know connecting
02:21:16 with humans and  we can go philosophical in terms of like a deep meaningful connection like
02:21:23 love but even just like collaborating in an interesting way how important is touch like
02:21:30  from the engineering perspective and the philosophical one i think it's super important let's even
02:21:37 just in a practical sense if we forget about the emotional part of it but for robots to interact
02:21:44 safely while they're doing meaningful mechanical work in the pro in the you know close contact with or vicinity
02:21:54 of people that need help i think we have to have them they have we have to build them
02:21:58 differently they have to be afraid not afraid of touching the world so  i think baymax is just awesome
02:22:03 that's just like the the the movie of big hero 6 and the the concept of baymax that's just
02:22:10 awesome i think we should and we have some folks at toyota that are trying to toyota research that are
02:22:16 trying to build baymax roughly and i think it's just a fantastically good project
02:22:23 i think it will change the way people physically interact the same way i mean you gave a couple
02:22:29 examples earlier but but if i if the robot that was walking around my home looks more like a teddy bear
02:22:35 and a little less like the terminator that could change completely the way people perceive it
02:22:41 and interact with it and maybe they'll even want to teach it like you said right you could not quite gamify it
02:22:48 but somehow instead of people judging it and looking at it as if 
02:22:54 it's not doing as well as a human they're going to try to help out the cute teddy bear
02:22:59 right who knows but i i think we're building robots wrong and being more soft and more contact
02:23:08 is important right yeah and like all the magical moments i can remember with robots
02:23:14 well first of all just visiting your lab seeing atlas but also spot menu when i first spot saw
02:23:22 spot many in person and hung out with him her  it i don't have trouble engendering robots i feel robotics
02:23:30 people really say always it i kind of like the idea that it's a her or
02:23:37 him  there's a magical moment but there's no touching  i guess the question i have have you ever been um
02:23:44 like have you had a human robot experience where like a robot touched you
02:23:52 and like it was like wait like was there a moment that you've forgotten that a robot is a robot and like the anthropomorphization
02:24:02 stepped in and for a second you forgot that it's not human i mean i think when you're in on the details
02:24:11 then we we of course anthropomorphized our work with atlas but in you know in verbal communication and the like i
02:24:18 think we were pretty aware of it as a machine that needed to be respected i actually i worry more about the
02:24:26 smaller robots that could still you know move quickly if programmed wrong and 
02:24:31 and we have to be careful actually about safety and the like right now and that if we build our robots
02:24:37 correctly i think then those a lot of those concerns could go away and we're seeing that trend we're
02:24:41 seeing the lower cost lighter weight arms now that could be i mean i do think touch is so
02:24:52 fundamental ted adelson is  is great he's a perceptual scientist at mit and he
02:25:01 studied vision most of his life and he said when i had kids i expected to be fascinated by
02:25:09 their perceptual development but what really what he noticed was felt more impressive more dominant was the
02:25:15 way that they would touch everything and lick everything and pick things up stick it on their tongue
02:25:19 and whatever and he said watching his daughter  convinced him that actually he needed
02:25:28 to study tactile sensing more so there's something very important i think it's a little bit also
02:25:35 of the passive versus active part of the world right you can
02:25:45 but it's fundamentally different if you can do an experiment right and if you can change the world and you
02:25:50 can learn a lot more than a passive observer so you can in dialogue that was your
02:25:58 initial example you could have an active experiment exchange but i think if you're just a camera watching youtube
02:26:05 i think that's a very different problem than if you're a robot that can apply force and touch
02:26:15 i i i think it's important yeah i think it's just an exciting area of research i think you're probably
02:26:20 right that this hasn't been under researched it's  to me as a person who's captivated by
02:26:27 the idea of human robot interaction it feels like such a rich opportunity to explore touch not even
02:26:36 from a safety perspective but like you said the emotional too i mean safety comes first um
02:26:44 but the next step is like you know  like a real human connection even in the war like even in the
02:26:51 industrial setting it just feels like  it's nice for the robot i don't know i you know you might
02:26:59 disagree with this but because i think it's important to see robots as tools
02:27:06 often but i don't know i think they're just always going to be more effective once you humanize them
02:27:13  like it's convenient now to think of them as tools because we want to focus on the safety
02:27:19 but i think ultimately to create like a good experience for the worker for the person
02:27:27 there has to be a human element i don't know for me i i it feels like like an industrial robotic arm
02:27:34 would be better if as a human element i think like we think robotics had that idea with
02:27:41 baxter and having eyes and so on having i don't know i'm a big believer in that i it's not my area
02:27:49 but i am also a big believer do you have yes i i i don't know if i'd more so than if i had a different science project
02:28:05 that i'd worked on yeah i mean the robot we basically had to do heart surgery on the robot in the
02:28:16 final competition because we melted the core and  and yeah there was something about watching
02:28:24 that robot hanging there we know we had to compete with it in an hour and it was getting its
02:28:29 guts ripped out those are all historic moments i think if we look back like 100 years from now
02:28:37 yeah i think those are important moments in robotics i mean these are the early day you look
02:28:41 at like the early days of a lot of scientific disciplines they look ridiculous they're full of failure
02:28:47 but it feels like robotics will be important in the coming  100 years and these are the early days so
02:28:58 so i think a lot of people are look at  a brilliant person such as yourself and and are curious about the intellectual
02:29:04 journey they've took is there maybe three books technical fiction philosophical that um
02:29:13 had a big impact on your life that you would recommend yeah so i actually didn't read that
02:29:21 much as a kid but i there are some recent books that if you're interested in this kind of topic
02:29:34 like ai superpowers by kaifuli is just a fantastic read you must read that um
02:29:42 yuval harari is just i think that can open your mind sapiens sapiens as as the first one homo deuce
02:29:49 is the second yeah i think we mentioned the black swan by taleb i think that's a good sort of
02:29:57 mind opener so so there's maybe a more controversial recommendation i could give great
02:30:07 well i would love something sure in some sense it's it's so classical it might surprise you but
02:30:15 i actually recently read mortimer adler's how to read a book not so long it was a while ago but
02:30:23 some people hate that book i loved it i think we're in this time right now where
02:30:32 boy we're just inundated with research papers that you could read on archive with
02:30:39 limited peer review and just this wealth of information i don't know i think the
02:30:49 passion of what you can get out of a book a really good book or a really good paper if you find it
02:30:55 the attitude the realization that you're only going to find a few that really are worth all your time but then
02:31:02 once you find them you should just dig in and and and understand it very deeply and it's worth
02:31:09 you know marking it up and and  you know having the hard copy writing in the the side notes side margins
02:31:17 i think that was really it i read it at the right time where i was just feeling just
02:31:25 overwhelmed with really low quality stuff i guess and similarly  i'm just giving more than three now
02:31:34 i'm sorry if i've exceeded my my quota but on that topic just real quick is 
02:31:41 so basically finding a few companions to keep for the rest of your life in terms of papers and books and so on and
02:31:50 those are the ones like not doing what is it fomo fear missing out constantly trying to update yourself
02:31:57 but really deeply making a life journey of studying a particular paper essentially a set of papers yeah i think
02:32:06 when you really find something which a book that resonates with you might not be the same book that resonates with me
02:32:12 but when you really find one that resonates with you i think the dialogue that happens
02:32:17 and that's what i love that adler was saying you know i think socrates and plato say um
02:32:24 the the written word is never going to capture the beauty of dialogue right but adler says no no
02:32:32 a a really good book is a dialogue between you and the author and it crosses time and space and 
02:32:39 i don't know i think it's a very romantic there's a bunch of like specific advice which you can just gloss
02:32:45 over but the romantic view of how to read and really appreciate it is is is so good
02:32:59 i thought a lot about teaching and  and so isaac asimov great science fiction writer has also
02:33:04 actually spent a lot of his career writing nonfiction right his memoir is fantastic
02:33:11 he was passionate about explaining things right he wrote all kinds of books on all kinds of topics in science
02:33:17 he was known as the great explainer and some you know i i do really resonate with his style
02:33:26 and  and just his way of talking about you know by communicating and explaining to something is really
02:33:33 the way that you learn something i think think about problems very differently because of the way i've been
02:33:39 given the opportunity to teach them at mit and we have questions asked you know the fear of the lecture
02:33:47 the experience of the lecture and the questions i get and the interactions just forces me to be rock solid on on
02:33:54 these ideas in a way that i didn't have that i i don't know i would be in a different intellectual space
02:34:00 also video does that scare you that your lectures are online and people like me and sweatpants can
02:34:06 sit sipping coffee and watch what you give lectures that i think it's great i do think that something's changed
02:34:13 right now which is you know right now we're giving lectures over zoom
02:34:18 i mean giving seminars over zoom and everything i'm trying to figure out i think it's a new medium
02:34:25 do you think it's trying to figure out how to use it yeah i've been i've been
02:34:34 quite cynical about the human to human connection over over that medium but i think that's
02:34:41 because it's hasn't been explored fully and teaching is a different thing
02:34:48 every lecture is a is a i'm sorry every seminar even i think every talk i give i i
02:34:54 you know there's an opportunity to give that differently i can i can deliver content directly into your
02:34:59 browser you have a webgl engine right there i could i can throw 3d  content into your browser while
02:35:06 you're listening to me right yeah and i can assume that you have a you know at least a
02:35:11 powerful enough laptop or something to watch zoom while i'm doing that while i'm giving a lecture
02:35:17 that that's a that's a new communication tool that i didn't have last year right and  i think robotics can potentially
02:35:26 benefit a lot from teaching that way we'll see it's going to be an experiment this fall
02:35:30 i'm thinking a lot about it yeah and also like the the length of lectures or the
02:35:36 length of like there's something so like i guarantee you
02:35:42 you know it's like 80 percent of people who started listening to our conversation are still listening to now which is
02:35:48 crazy to me but so there's a there's a patience and a interest in long-form content
02:35:55 but at the same time there's a magic to forcing yourself to condense an idea to as short as possible
02:36:04  as short as possible like clip it can be part of a longer thing but like just like really
02:36:09 beautifully condensed idea there's a lot of opportunity there that's easier to do and remote with
02:36:18 i don't know  with editing too editing is an interesting thing like what 
02:36:25 you know most professors don't get when they give a lecture you don't get to go back and edit out parts
02:36:31 like chris like crisp it up a little bit that's also it can do magic like if you remove like five to ten minutes from an
02:36:39 hour lecture it can it can actually cr it can make something special of a lecture i've 
02:36:47 i've seen that in myself and and in others too because i edit other people's lectures to extract clips
02:36:51 it's like there's certain tangents they're like that lose they're not interesting they're
02:36:56 they're they're mumbling they're just not they're not clarifying they're not helpful at all
02:37:01 and once you remove them it's just i don't know editing can be magic  take a lot of time
02:37:08 yeah it takes it depends like what is yeah because i find the editing process is
02:37:18 also beneficial as  for teaching but also for your own learning i don't know if have you watched
02:37:24 yourself in the survey have you watched those videos it's i mean not all of them okay
02:37:29 it could be it could be painful yeah and to see like how to improve so do you find that i know you
02:37:35 segment your your podcast do you think that helps people with the the attention span aspect of it
02:37:43 or is it segment like sections like yeah we're talking about this topic whatever no
02:37:49 no that just helps me it's actually bad so  and you've been incredible  so i'm i'm
02:37:56 learning like i'm afraid of conversation this is even today i'm terrified of talking to
02:38:00 you i mean it's something i'm trying to remove from myself i there's this a guy i mean i've learned
02:38:07 from a lot of people but really there's been a few people who's been inspirational to me in terms
02:38:14 of conversation whatever people think of him joe rogan has been inspirational to me because
02:38:21 comedians have been too being able to just have fun and enjoy themselves and lose themselves in conversation
02:38:27 that requires you to be a great storyteller to be able to  pull a lot of different pieces of information together
02:38:35 but mostly just to enjoy yourself in conversations i'm trying to learn that these notes are you
02:38:41 see me looking down that's like a safety blanket that i'm trying to let go of more and more
02:38:47 cool so that's that people love just regular conversation that's what they the structure is like whatever
02:38:56 i would say i would say maybe like 10 to like so there's a bunch of you know
02:39:02 there's  probably a couple thousand phd students listening to this right now right and they might know what we're
02:39:09 talking about but there's somebody i guarantee you right now
02:39:16 in russia some kid who's just like who's just smoke some weed is sitting back and just enjoying the hell out of this
02:39:23 conversation not really understanding he kind of watched some boston dynamics videos he's just enjoying it
02:39:30 and i salute you sir  no but just like there's a so much variety of people that just have
02:39:36 curiosity about engineering about sciences about mathematics and and also like i should that i mean  enjoying it is one thing
02:39:46 but i also often notice it inspires people to there's a lot of people who are like in
02:39:53 their undergraduate studies trying to figure out what  trying to figure out what to pursue
02:39:59 and those these conversations can really spark the direction there of their life and in terms of robotics i
02:40:05 hope it does because  i'm excited about the possibilities for robotics brings on that
02:40:13 topic do you have advice like what advice would you give to a young person
02:40:20 about life a young person about life or a young person about life and robotics  it could be
02:40:25 in robotics it could be in life in general it could be career
02:40:31 it could be  relationship advice it could be running advice just like they're um
02:40:36 that's one of the things i see you like to talk to like 20 year olds they're they're like how do i how do i
02:40:42 do this thing what do i do if they come up to you what would you tell them i think
02:40:51 it's an interesting time to be a kid everything points to this being sort of a winner take all economy and the like i think
02:41:03 the people that will really excel in my opinion are going to be the ones that can think deeply
02:41:13 you have to be able to ask questions agilely and use the internet for everything it's good for and stuff like
02:41:17 this and i think a lot of people will develop those skills i think the the leaders
02:41:25 thought leaders you know robotics leaders whatever are going to be the ones that can do
02:41:30 more and they can think very deeply and critically and that's a harder thing to learn i think one one path to learning that is
02:41:37 through mathematics i would encourage people to start math early i mean i
02:41:48 didn't really start i mean i was always in the the better math classes that i could
02:41:53 take but i wasn't pursuing super advanced mathematics or anything like that until i got to mit i think mit
02:42:02 lit me up and really started the life that i'm living now but yeah i really want kids to to dig deep
02:42:12 really understand things building things too i mean pull things apart put them back together like that's just
02:42:18 such a good way to really understand things and expect it to be a long journey right it's  you don't
02:42:27 have to know everything you're never gonna know everything so think deeply and
02:42:33 stick with it enjoy the ride but just make sure you're not yeah just just make sure you're you're
02:42:41 you're stopping to think about why things work yeah it's true it's  it's easy to lose yourself in the
02:42:52 we're overwhelmed with content right now but you have to stop and pick some of it and really understand
02:43:01 yeah on the book point i've read animal farm by george orwell a ridiculous number of times so for me
02:43:08 like that book i don't know if it's a good book in general but for me it connects deeply somehow
02:43:15  it somehow connects so i was born in the soviet union so it connects to me to the entire
02:43:22 history of the soviet union and to world war ii and to the love and hatred and suffering
02:43:27 that went on there and the  the corrupting nature of power and greed and
02:43:36 just somehow i just that that that book has taught me more about life than like anything else
02:43:41 even though it's just like a silly like childlike book about adam pigs it's like i don't know why it
02:43:48 just connects and inspires  the same there's a few yeah there's a few technical books too
02:43:55 and algorithms that just yeah you return too often right i'm i'm i'm with you
02:44:03  yeah there's  i don't and i've been losing that because of the internet i've been like
02:44:07  going and i've been going on archive and blog posts and github
02:44:15 and and the new thing and of you lose your ability to really master an idea right
02:44:22 wow exactly right what's a fond memory from childhood well i guess i just said that um
02:44:34 at least my current life begins began when i got to mit if i have to go farther than that yeah
02:44:42 what was was there life before mit oh absolutely but but let me actually tell you what happened when i
02:44:49 first got to mit because that i think might be relevant here but i yeah you know i i had taken a computer
02:44:57 engineering degree at michigan i enjoyed it immensely learned a bunch of stuff i was i liked computers i
02:45:04 liked how to like programming but when i did get to mit and started working with sebastian sung
02:45:10 theoretical physicist computational neuroscientist the culture here was just different it demanded more of me certainly mathematically
02:45:22 and in the critical thinking and i remember the day that i  borrowed one of the books from
02:45:29 my advisor's office and walked down to the charles river and was like i'm getting my butt kicked you know um
02:45:37 and i think that's going to happen to everybody who's doing this kind of stuff right i think 
02:45:44 i expected you to ask me the meaning of life you know i think that the  somehow i think that's that's gotta
02:45:51 be part of it this doing hard things yeah did you  did you consider
02:45:58 quitting at any point did you consider this isn't for me no never that i mean i was
02:46:06 it was working hard but i was loving it right there's i think the there's this magical thing
02:46:10 where you you know i'm lucky to surround myself with people that basically
02:46:17 almost every day i'll i'll i'll see something i'll be told something or something that i realize wow i don't
02:46:23 understand that and if i could just understand that there's there's something else to learn that if i could
02:46:27 just learn that thing i would connect another piece of the puzzle and and 
02:46:33 you know i think that is just such an important aspect and being willing to understand what you can and can't do and and
02:46:43 loving the journey of going and learning those other things i think that's the best part i don't
02:46:48 think there's a better way to end it or us i've you've been an
02:46:53 inspiration to me since i showed up at mit  your work has been an inspiration to the world this conversation was amazing
02:47:01 i can't wait to see what you do next with robotics home robots i i hope to see you work in my home one
02:47:07 day thanks so much for talking today has been awesome cheers thanks for listening to this

02:47:56 from neil degrasse tyson talking about robots in space and the emphasis we humans put
02:48:03 on human-based space exploration robots are important if i don my pure scientist hat
02:48:10 i would say just send robots i'll stay down here and get the data but nobody's ever given a parade for a
02:48:15 robot nobody's ever named a high school after a robot so when i down my public educator hat
02:48:21 i have to recognize the elements of exploration that excite people it's not only the discoveries and the
02:48:27 beautiful photos that come down from the heavens it's the vicarious participation in discovery itself
