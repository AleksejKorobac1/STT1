00:00:01 following is a conversation with David Ferrucci he led the team that built Watson the IBM question-answering system
00:00:08 that beat the top humans in the world at the game of Jeopardy for spending a couple hours of David I saw a genuine
00:00:15 passion not only for abstract understanding of intelligence but for engineering it to solve real-world
00:00:22 problems under real-world deadlines and resource constraints where science meets engineering is where brilliant simple
00:00:30 ingenuity emerges people who work adjoining it to have a lot of wisdom earned two failures and eventual success
00:00:39 David is also the founder CEO and chief scientist of elemental cognition a company working to engineer AI systems
00:00:46 that understand the world the way people do this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on
00:00:54 YouTube give it five stars and iTunes support it on patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter Alex Friedman spelled
00:01:02 Fri D M a.m. and now here's my conversation with David Ferrucci your undergrad was in biology with a
00:01:11 with an eye toward medical school before you went on for the PhD in computer science so let me ask you an easy
00:01:18 question what is the difference between biological systems and computer systems in your when you sit back look at the
00:01:29 Stars and think philosophically I often wonder I often wonder whether or not there is a substantive difference and I
00:01:34 think the thing that got me into computer science and artificial intelligence was exactly this
00:01:42 presupposition that if we can get machines to think or I should say this question this philosophical question if
00:01:50 we can get machines to think to understand to process information the way do we do so if we can describe a
00:01:58 procedure or describe a process even if that process where the intelligence process itself then what would be the difference
00:02:07 so from philosophical standpoint I'm not trying to convince that there are there is I mean you can go in the direction of
00:02:15 spirituality you can go in the direction of a soul but in terms of you know what we can what we can experience from an
00:02:24 intellectual and physical perspective I'm not sure there is clearly there implement there are different
00:02:32 implementations but if you were to say as a biological information processing system fundamentally more capable than
00:02:40 one we might be able to build out of silicon or or some other substrate I don't I don't know that there is how
00:02:49 distant do you think is the biological implementation so fundamentally they may have the same capabilities but is it
00:02:59 really a far mystery where a huge number of breakthroughs are needed to be able to understand it or is that something
00:03:06 that for the most part in the important aspects echoes are the same kind of characteristics yeah that's interesting
00:03:14 I mean I so you know your question presupposes that there's this goal to recreate you know what we perceive is
00:03:22 biological intelligence I'm not I'm not sure that's the I'm not sure that that's how I would state the goal I mean I
00:03:30 think that studying the goal good so I think there are a few goals I think that understanding the human brain and how it
00:03:42 works is important for us to be able to diagnose and treat issues for us to understand our own strengths and
00:03:50 weaknesses both intellectual psychological and physical so neuroscience and on sending the brain
00:03:56 from that perspective has a there's a clear clear goal there from the perspective of saying I want to I want
00:04:04 to I want to mimic human intelligence that one's a little bit more interesting human intelligence certainly has a lot
00:04:11 of things we Envy it's also got a lot of problems too so I think we're capable of sort of stepping back and saying what do
00:04:20 we want out of it what do we want out of an intelligence how do we want to communicate with that intelligence how
00:04:26 do we want to behave how do we want it to perform now of course it's it's somewhat of an interesting argument
00:04:32 because I'm sitting here as a human with a biological brain and I'm critiquing this trends and weaknesses of human
00:04:39 intelligence and saying that we have the capacity just the capacity to step back and say gee what what is intelligence is
00:04:45 what do we really want out of it and that even in and of itself suggests that human intelligence is something quite
00:04:54 amiable that it could you know it can it can it can introspect that it could introspect that way and the flaws you
00:05:00 mentioned the flaws the human self yeah but I think I think that flaws that humans wholeness house is extremely
00:05:08 prejudicial and bias and the way it draws many inferences do you think those are sorry to interrupt you think those
00:05:14 are features or are those bugs do you think the the prejudice the forgetfulness the fear what other flaws
00:05:24 list them all what love maybe that's a flaw you think those are all things that can be get gotten getting in the way of
00:05:32 intelligence or the essential components of and well again if you go back and you define
00:05:37 intelligence as being able to sort of accuracy accurately precisely rigorously reason develop answers and justify those
00:05:46 answers in an objective way yeah then human intelligence has these flaws and that it tends to be more
00:05:54 influenced by some of the things you said and it's and it's largely an inductive process meaning it takes past
00:06:02 data uses that to predict the future very advantageous in some cases but fundamentally biased and prejudicial in
00:06:09 other cases because it's gonna be strongly influenced by its priors whether they're whether they're right or
00:06:15 wrong from some you know objective reasoning perspective you're gonna favor them because that's those are the
00:06:22 decisions or those are the paths that succeeded in the past and I think that mode of intelligence makes a lot of
00:06:31 sense for when your primary goal is to act quickly and and and survive and make fast decisions and I think those create
00:06:41 problems when you want to think more deeply and make more objective and reasons that decisions of course humans
00:06:48 capable of doing both they do sort of one more naturally than they do the other but they're capable of doing both
00:06:54 you're saying they do the one that responds quickly in it more naturally right because that's the thing you kind
00:07:02 of need to not be eaten by the Predators in the world for example but I mean better than we've we've learned to
00:07:10 reason through logic we've developed science we train people to do that I think that's harder for the individual
00:07:18 to do I think it requires training and you know and and and teaching I think we are human - certainly is capable of it
00:07:25 but we find more difficult and then there are other weaknesses if you will as you mentioned earlier it's just
00:07:33 memory capacity and how many chains of inference can you actually go through without like losing your way so just
00:07:41 focus and so the way you think about intelligence and we're really sort of floating this philosophical slightly
00:07:49 but I think you're like the perfect person to talk about this because we'll get to jeopardy and beyond that's like
00:07:58 an incredible one of the most incredible accomplishments in AI in the history of AI but hence the philosophical
00:08:05 discussion so let me ask you've kind of alluded to it but let me ask again what is intelligence underlying the
00:08:13 discussions we'll have with with jeopardy and beyond how do you think about intelligence is it a sufficiently
00:08:20 complicated problem being able to reason your way through solving that problem is that kind of how you think about what it
00:08:26 means to be intelligent so I think of intelligence to primarily two ways one is the ability to predict so in other
00:08:35 words if I have a problem what's gonna can I predict what's going to happen next whether it's to you know predict
00:08:41 the answer of a question or to say look I'm looking at all the market dynamics and I'm going to tell you what's going
00:08:47 to happen next or you're in a in a room and somebody walks in and you're going to predict what they're going to do next
00:08:53 or what they're going to say next doing that in a highly dynamic environment full of uncertainty be able to lots of
00:09:00 lockdown the more the more variables the more complex the more possibilities the more complex but can I take a small
00:09:08 amount of prior data and learn the pattern and then predict what's going to happen next accurately and consistently
00:09:15 that's a that's certainly a form of intelligence what do you need for that by the way you need to have an
00:09:22 understanding of the way the world works in order to be able to unroll it into the future all right thank you one thing
00:09:28 is needed to predict depends what you mean by understanding IIIi need to be able to find that function and this is
00:09:34 very much like what function deep learning does machine learning does is if you give me enough prior data and you
00:09:41 tell me what the output variable is that matters I'm going to sit there and be able to predict it and if I can predict
00:09:47 you predict it accurately so that I can get it right more often than not I'm smart if I do that with less data and
00:09:56 less training time I'm even smarter if I can figure out what's even worth predicting I'm smarter meaning I'm
00:10:05 figuring out what path is gonna get me toward a goal what about picking a goal so again well
00:10:09 that's interesting about picking our goal sort of an interesting thing I think that's where you bring in what do
00:10:15 you pre-programmed to do we talked about humans and humans a pre-programmed to survive so sort of their primary you
00:10:23 know driving goal what do they have to do to do that and that that could be very complex right so it's not just it's
00:10:31 not just figuring out that you need to run away from their ferocious tiger but we survive in social context as an
00:10:40 example so understanding the subtleties of social dynamics becomes something that's important for surviving finding a
00:10:48 mate reproducing right so we're continually challenged with complex sets of variables complex constraints rules
00:10:56 if you will that we we or patterns and we learn how to find the functions and predict the things in other words
00:11:03 represent those patterns efficiently and be able to predict what's going to happen that's a form of intelligence
00:11:08 that doesn't really record that doesn't really require anything specific other than ability to find that function and
00:11:15 and predict that right answer it's certainly a form of intelligence but then when we when we say well do we
00:11:25 understand each other in other words do would you perceive me as as intelligent beyond that ability to predict so now I
00:11:33 can predict but I can't really articulate how I'm going to that process what my underlying theory is for
00:11:42 predicting and I can't get you to understand what I'm doing so that you can follow you can figure out how to do
00:11:49 this yourself if you hadn't if you did not have for example the right pattern matching machinery that I did and now we
00:11:55 have potentially have this breakdown where in effect I'm intelligent but I'm sort of an alien intelligence relative
00:12:03 to you you're intelligent but nobody knows about it or I can see the I can see the output knowing so so you're
00:12:10 saying let's to separate the two things one is you explaining why you were able to predict
00:12:21 the future and and the second is me being able to like impressing me that you're intelligent me being able to know
00:12:27 that you successfully predicted the future do you think that's well it's not a pressing you item intelligent in other
00:12:34 words you may be convinced that I'm intelligent in some form so high well because of my ability to predict so I
00:12:41 would imagine that wow wow you're right all here you're you're right more times than I am you're doing something
00:12:47 interesting that's a form that's a form of intelligence but then what happens is if I say how are you doing that and you
00:12:56 can't communicate with me and you can't describe that to me now I'm a label you a savant I mean I may say well you're
00:13:04 doing something weird and it's and it's just not very interesting to me because you and I can't really communicate and
00:13:12 and so now this is interesting right because now this is you're in this weird place where for you to be recognized as
00:13:21 intelligent the way I'm intelligent then you and I sort of have to be able to communicate and then my we start to
00:13:29 understand each other and then my respect and my my appreciation my ability to relate to you starts to
00:13:37 change so now you're not an alien intelligence anymore yours you're our human intelligence now because you and I
00:13:44 can communicate and so I think when we look at when we look at when we look at animals for example animals can do
00:13:50 things we can't quite comprehend we don't quite know how they do them but they can't really communicate with us
00:13:56 they can't put what they're going through in our terms and so we think of them in sort of low there are these
00:14:01 alien intelligences and they're not really worthless so what we're worth we don't treat them the same way as a
00:14:08 result of that but it's it's hard because who knows what you know what's going on so just a quick elaboration on
00:14:17 that the explaining that you're intelligent the explaining the the reasoning the one end to the prediction
00:14:26 is not some kind of mathematical proof if we look at humans look at political debates and discourse on Twitter it's
00:14:35 mostly just telling stories so you usually your task is sorry that your task is not to tell an accurate
00:14:45 depiction of how you reason but to tell a story real or not that convinces me that there was a mechanism by which you
00:14:53 ultimately that's what a proof is I mean even a mathematical proof is is that because ultimately the other
00:14:59 mathematicians have to be convinced by your proof otherwise in fact they're been that the measurement success yeah
00:15:05 yeah there have been several proofs out there where mathematicians would study for a long time before they were
00:15:09 convinced that it actually proved anything right you never know if it proved anything until the community of
00:15:15 mathematicians decided that it did so I mean so it's but it's it's a real thing yeah and and that's sort of the point
00:15:23 right is that ultimately on you know this notion of understanding us understanding something there's
00:15:28 ultimately a social concept in other words you I have to convince enough people that I I did this in a reasonable
00:15:35 way I did this in a way that other people can understand and and replicate and that make sense to them so we're
00:15:43 very human Houghton's is bound together in that way we're bound up in that sense we sort of never really get away with it
00:15:51 until we can consider convince others that our thinking process you know make sense did you think the general question
00:16:00 of intelligence is then also social constructs so if we task asked questions of an artificial intelligence system is
00:16:09 this system intelligent the answer will ultimately be a socially constructed I think I think so I so I think you're
00:16:16 making to be a mess I'm saying we can try to define intelligence in this super objective way that says here here's this
00:16:24 data I want to predict this type of thing learn this function and then if you get it right often enough we
00:16:32 consider you intelligent but that's more like a stepfather that I think it I think it is it doesn't mean it's
00:16:38 useful if it could be incredible useful it could be solving a problem we can't otherwise solve and can solve it more
00:16:45 reliably than we can but then there's this notion of can humans take responsibility for the decision that
00:16:54 you're that you're making can we make those decisions ourselves can we relate to the process that you're going through
00:17:01 and now you as an agent whether you're a machine or another human frankly are now obliged to make me understand how it is
00:17:10 that you're arriving at that answer and allow me I mean me or the obviously a community or a judge of people to decide
00:17:17 whether or not whether or not that makes sense and by the way that happens with the humans as well you're sitting down
00:17:22 with your staff for example and you ask for suggestions about what to do next and someone says well I think you should
00:17:29 buy and I think you should buy this much or would have or sell or whatever it is or I think you should launch the product
00:17:36 today or tomorrow or launch this product versus that product whatever decision may be and you ask why and the person so
00:17:42 I just have a good feeling about it and it's not you're not very satisfied now that person could be you know you might
00:17:49 say well you've been right you know before but I'm gonna put the company on the line can you explain to me why I
00:17:58 should believe this and that explanation may have nothing to do with the truth just them and all them convinced the
00:18:05 wrong yes they'll be wrong she's got to be convincing but it's ultimately got to be convinced and that's why I'm saying
00:18:12 it's we're bound together right our intelligences are bound together in that sense we have to understand each other
00:18:17 and and if for example you're giving me an explanation I mean this is a very important point right you're giving me
00:18:26 an explanation and I'm and I and I and I have iton I'm not good and then I'm not good at reasoning well and being
00:18:37 objective and following logical paths and consistent paths and I'm not good at measuring and sort of computing
00:18:45 probabilities across those paths what happens is collectively we're not going to do we're not going to do well
00:18:52 how hard is that problem the second one so we I think will talk quite a bit about the the first on a specific
00:19:02 objective metric benchmark performing well but being able to explain the steps the reasoning how hard is that probably
00:19:12 that's I think that's very hard I mean I think that that's well it's hard for humans the thing that's hard for humans
00:19:22 as you know may not necessarily be hard for computers and vice-versa so sorry so how hard is that problem for computers I
00:19:32 think it's hard for computers and the reason why are related to or saying that it's also hard for humans is because I
00:19:38 think when we step back and we say we want to design computers to do that one of the things we have to recognize is
00:19:50 we're not sure how to do it well I'm not sure we have a recipe for that and even if you wanted to learn it it's not clear
00:19:59 exactly what data we use and what judgments we use to learn that well and so what I mean by that is if you look at
00:20:09 the entire enterprise of science science is supposed to be at a bad objective reason and reason right so we think
00:20:17 about who's the most intelligent person or group of people in the world do we think about the savants who can close
00:20:25 their eyes and give you a number we'd think about the think tanks or the scientists of the philosophers who kind
00:20:32 of work through the details and write the papers and come up with the thoughtful logical proves and use the
00:20:39 scientific method and I think it's the latter and my point is that how do you train someone to do that and that's what
00:20:47 I mean by it's hard how do you what's the process of training people to do that well that's a hard process we work
00:20:56 as a society we work pretty hard to get other people to understand our thinking and to convince them of things now we
00:21:03 could for so weighed them obviously talked about this like human flaws or weaknesses we can
00:21:10 persuade through persuade then through emotional means but to but to get them to understand and connect to and follow
00:21:20 a logical argument is difficult we try it we do it we do it as scientists we try to do it as journalists we know we
00:21:26 try to do it as you know even artists in many forms as writers as teachers we go to a fairly significant training process
00:21:35 to do that and then we could ask what why is that so hard but it's hard and for humans it takes a
00:21:44 lot of work and when we step back and say well step back and say well how do we get a machine - how do we get a
00:21:49 machine to do that it's a vexing question how would you begin to try to solve that and maybe just a quick pause
00:21:59 because there's an optimistic notion in the things you're describing which is being able to explain something through
00:22:07 reason but if you look at algorithms that recommend things that we look at next well there's Facebook Google advertising
00:22:17 based companies you know their goal is to convince you to buy things based on anything so that could be reason because
00:22:27 the best of advertisement is showing you things that you really do need and explain why you need it but it could
00:22:36 also be through emotional manipulation the algorithm that describes why a certain reason a certain decision was
00:22:46 was made how hard is it to do it through emotional manipulation and why is that a good or a bad thing so you've kind of
00:22:57 focused on reason logic really showing in a clear way why something is good one is that even a thing that us humans do
00:23:09 and and and - how do you think of the differences in the reasoning aspect and the emotional manipulation
00:23:16 well they you know so you call it emotional manipulation but more objectively is essentially saying you
00:23:21 know thing you know there are certain features of things that seem to attract your attention I'm gonna kind of give
00:23:26 you more of that stuff manipulation is a bad word yeah I mean I'm not saying it's good right or wrong
00:23:32 is it it works to get your attention and it works to get you to buy stuff and when you think about algorithms that
00:23:38 look at the patterns of the you know patterns of features that you seem to be spending your money on and is there
00:23:43 going to give you something with a similar pattern so I'm going to learn that function because the objective is
00:23:48 to get you to click on and/or get you to buy and or whatever it is I don't know I mean that it is like it is what it is I
00:23:55 mean that's what the algorithm does you can argue whether it's good or bad it depends what your you know what your
00:24:00 what your goal is I guess this seems to very useful for convincing telling us the thing for
00:24:07 convincing humans yeah it's good because you gives again this goes back to how does a human you know what is the human
00:24:14 behavior like how does a human you know brain respond to things I think there's a more optimistic view of that too which
00:24:22 is that if you're searching for certain kinds of things you've already reasoned that you need them and these these
00:24:29 algorithms are saying look that's up to you the reason whether you need something or not that's your job you know you you met
00:24:36 you may have an unhealthy addiction to this stuff or you may have a reasoned explanation for why it's important to
00:24:45 you and the algorithms are saying hey that's like whatever like that's your problem all I know is you're buying
00:24:51 stuff like that you're interested in stuff like that could be a bad reason could be a good reason that's up to you
00:24:56 I'm gonna show you more of that stuff and so and I and I and I think that that's it's not good or bad it it's not
00:25:04 reason or not reason the algorithm is doing what it does which is saying you seems to be interested in this I'm going
00:25:09 to show you more that stuff and I think we're seeing it's not just in buying stuff but even in social media you're
00:25:13 reading this kind of stuff I'm not judging on whether it's good or bad I'm not reasoning at all I'm just saying I'm
00:25:19 gonna show you other stuff with similar features and you know and like and that's it and I wash my hands from it
00:25:24 and I say that's all you know that's all what's going on you know there is you know people are so harsh on AI systems
00:25:33 so one the bar of performance is extremely high and yet we also asked them to in the case of social media to
00:25:42 help find the better angels of our nature and help make a better society so what do you think about the role of it
00:25:50 that so that agrees you that's that's the interesting dichotomy right because on one hand we're sitting there and
00:25:56 we're sort of doing the easy part which is finding the patterns we're not building the systems not building a
00:26:02 theory that it's consumable and understandable other humans that could being explained and justified and and so
00:26:09 on one hand to say oh you know AI is doing this why isn't doing this other thing well those other things a lot
00:26:17 harder and it's interesting to think about why why why it's harder and because you're interpreting you're
00:26:25 interpreting the data in the context of prior models in other words understandings of what's important in
00:26:30 the world what's not important what are all the other abstract features that drive our decision-making
00:26:36 what's sensible what's not sensible what's good what's bad what's moral what's valuable what is it where is that
00:26:42 stuff no one's applying the interpretation so when I when I see you clicking on a bunch of stuff and I look
00:26:49 at these simple features the raw features the features that are there in a data like what words are being used
00:26:58 or how long the material is more other very superficial features what colors are being used in the material like I
00:27:04 don't know why you're clicking on the stuff you're looking or if it's products what the price of what the price is or
00:27:08 what the categories or stuff like that and I just feed you more of the same stuff that's very different than kind of
00:27:14 getting in there and saying what does this mean what the stuff you're reading like why are you reading it what
00:27:23 assumptions are you bringing to the table are those assumptions sensible is the miss the material make any sense
00:27:32 does it does it lead you to thoughtful good conclusions again there's judgment this interpretation judgment involved in
00:27:39 that process that isn't really happening in in in the AI today that's harder right because you have to start getting
00:27:50 at the meaning of this of the of the stop of the content you have to get at how humans interpret the content
00:27:58 relative to their value system and deeper thought processes so that's what meaning means is not just some kind of
00:28:09 deep timeless semantic thing that the statement represents but also how a large number of people are likely to
00:28:17 interpret so that's again even meaning is a social construct it's so you have to try to predict how most people would
00:28:24 understand this kind of statement yeah meaning is often relative but meaning implies that the connections go beneath
00:28:32 the surface of the artifact so if I show you a painting it's a bunch of colors in a canvas what does it mean to you and it
00:28:38 may mean different things at different people because of their different experiences it may mean something even
00:28:46 different to the artist to who painted it as we try to get more rigorous with our communication we try to really nail
00:28:54 down that meaning so we go from abstract art to precise mathematics precise engineering drawings and things like
00:29:03 that we're really trying to say I want to narrow that that space of possible interpretations because the precision of the
00:29:11 communication ends up becoming more and more important and so that means that I have to specify and I think that's why
00:29:22 this becomes really hard because if I'm just showing you an artifact and you're looking at it superficially whether it's
00:29:28 a bunch of words on a page or whether it's you know brushstrokes on a canvas or pixels on a photograph you can sit
00:29:35 there and you can interpret lots of different ways at many many different levels but when I want to when I want to
00:29:45 align our understanding of that I have to specify a lot more stuff that's actually not in it not directly in the
00:29:53 artifact now I have to say well how you were how are you interpreting this image and that image and what about the colors
00:30:00 and what do they mean to you what's what perspective are you bringing to the table what are your prior experiences with
00:30:05 those artifacts what are your fundamental assumptions and values what what is your ability to
00:30:13 kind of reason to chain together logical implication as you're sitting there and saying well if this is the case then I
00:30:16 would conclude this and if that's the case then I would conclude that and it so your reasoning processes and how they
00:30:24 work your prior models and what they are your values and your assumptions all those things now come together into the
00:30:32 interpretation getting in sick of that is hard and yet humans able to intuit some of that without any pre because
00:30:41 they have the shared experience me and we're not talking about shared two people have any shares know me as a
00:30:47 society that's correct we have this shared experience and we have similar brains so we tend to Institute in other
00:30:55 words part of our shared experiences are shared local experience like we may live in the same culture we may live in the
00:30:59 same society and therefore we have similar education we have similar what we like to call prior models about the
00:31:06 world prior experiences and we use that as a think of it as a wide collection of interrelated variables and they're all
00:31:13 bound to similar things and so we take that as our background and we start interpreting things similarly but as
00:31:20 humans we have it we have a lot of shared experience we do have similar brains similar goals similar
00:31:27 emotions under similar circumstances because we're both humans so now one of the early questions you ask well how is
00:31:34 biological and you know computer information systems fundamentally different well one is you know one is
00:31:42 come you means come with a lot of pre-programmed stuff yeah a ton of program stuff and they were able to
00:31:47 communicate because they have a lot of it because they share that stuff do you think that shared knowledge if it can
00:31:57 maybe escape the hardware question how much is encoded in the hardware just the shared knowledge in the software the the
00:32:04 history the many centuries of wars and so on that came to today that shared knowledge how hard is it to encode and
00:32:16 did you have a hope can you speak to how hard is it to encode that knowledge systematically in a way that could be
00:32:23 used by a computer so I think it is possible to learn to form machine to program machine to acquire that
00:32:31 knowledge with a similar foundation in other words in a similar interpretive interpretive foundation for processing
00:32:38 that knowledge but what do you mean by that so in other in other words foundation we view the world in a
00:32:46 particular way and so in other words we we have i if you will as humans we have a frame reference for bringing the world
00:32:54 around us so we have multiple frameworks for interpreting the world around us but if you're interpreting for example
00:33:01 social political interactions you're thinking about what there's people there's collections and groups of people
00:33:07 they have goals the goals largely built around survival and quality of life that are their fundamental economics around
00:33:17 scarcity of resources and when when humans come and start interpreting a situation like that because you've
00:33:22 brought you've grown up like historical events they start interpreting situations like that they apply a lot of
00:33:29 this a lot of this this fundamental framework for interpreting that well who are the people
00:33:33 what were their goals what users did they have how much power influence that they have over the other
00:33:39 like this fundamental substrate if you will for interpreting and reasoning about that so I think it is possible to
00:33:48 in view a computer with that that stuff that humans like take for granted when they go and sit down and try to
00:33:55 interpret things and then and then with that with that foundation they acquire they start acquiring the details the
00:34:02 specifics in any given situation are then able to interpret it with regard to that framework and then given that
00:34:08 interpretation they can do what they can predict but not only can they predict they can predict now with an explanation
00:34:18 that can be given in those terms in the terms of that underlying framework that most humans share now you could find
00:34:24 humans that come in interpret events very differently than other humans because they're like using a different
00:34:30 different framework you know movie matrix comes to mind where you know they decided the humans were really just
00:34:36 batteries and that's how they interpreted the value of humans as a source of electrical energy so but um
00:34:44 but I think that you know for the most part we we have a way of interpreting the events or do social events around us
00:34:54 because we have to share at framework it comes from again the fact that we're we're similar beings that have similar
00:35:01 goals similar emotions and we is we can make sense out of these these frameworks make sense to us so how much knowledge
00:35:08 is there do you think so it's you said it's possible well there's all its tremendous amount of detailed knowledge
00:35:14 in the world there you know you can imagine you know effectively infinite number of unique situations and unique
00:35:22 configurations of these things but the the knowledge that you need what I refer to as like the frameworks for you for
00:35:29 interpreting them I don't think I think that's those are finite you think the frameworks I'm more important than the
00:35:37 bulk of them now so it's like framing yeah because the frameworks do is they give you now the ability to interpret
00:35:42 and reason and to interpret and reasoning to interpret and reason over the specific
00:35:48 in ways that other humans would understand what about the specifics you know who acquired the specifics by
00:35:55 reading and by talking to other people and so mostly actually just even if we can focus on even the beginning the
00:36:02 common-sense stuff the stuff that doesn't even require reading or animalistic requires playing around with
00:36:08 the world or something just being able to sort of manipulate objects drink water and so on all does that every time
00:36:16 we try to do that kind of thing in robotics or AI it seems to be like an onion you seem to realize how much
00:36:24 knowledge is really required to perform you in some of these basic tasks do you have that sense as well and if so how do
00:36:34 we get all those details are they written down somewhere idea they have to be learned through experience so I think
00:36:41 when like if you're talking about sort of the physics the basic physics around us for example acquiring information
00:36:49 about for acquiring how that works yeah I think that I think there's a combination of things going I think
00:36:53 there's a combination of things going on I think there is like fundamental pattern matching like what were you
00:37:00 talking about before where you see enough examples enough data about something you start assuming that and
00:37:06 with similar input I'm going to predict similar outputs you don't can't necessarily explain it at all you may
00:37:12 learn very quickly that when you let something go it falls to the ground that's a that's a sickness is horribly
00:37:20 explained that but that's such a deep idea if you let something go like they do gravity I mean people were letting
00:37:28 things go and counting on them falling well before they understood gravity but that seems to be a that's exactly what I
00:37:35 mean is before you take a physics class or the or study anything about Newton just the idea that stuff falls to the
00:37:44 ground and they be able to generalize that other all kinds of stuff falls to the ground it just seems like a non if
00:37:54 without encoding it like hard coding it in it seems like a difficult thing to pick up it seemed like gift of Allah
00:38:02 of different knowledge to be able to integrate that into the framework sort of into everything else so both know
00:38:10 that stuff falls to the ground and start to reason about social political discourse so both like the very basic
00:38:20 and the high-level reasoning decision-making I guess my question is how hard is this problem and sorry to
00:38:29 linger on it because again and we'll get to it for sure as well Watson with jeopardy did its take on a problem
00:38:35 that's much more constrained but has the same hugeness of scale at least from the outsider's perspective so I'm asking the
00:38:44 general life question of to be able to be an intelligent being and reason in the in the world about both gravity and
00:38:53 politics how hard is that problem so I think it's solvable okay now beautiful so what about what about time
00:39:10 travel okay convinced not as convinced yet okay no I said I I think it is I mean I I took it as solvable I mean I
00:39:16 think that it's alert it's versatile it's about getting machines to learn learning is fundamental and I think
00:39:23 we're already in a place that we understand for example how machines can learn in various ways right now our
00:39:30 learning our learning stuff is sort of primitive in that we haven't sort of taught machines to learn the frameworks
00:39:41 we don't communicate our frameworks because of our shared in some cases we do but we don't annotate if you will all
00:39:48 the data in the world with the frameworks that are inherent or underlying our understanding instead we
00:39:57 just operate with the data so if we want to be able to reason over the data in similar terms in the common frameworks
00:40:03 we need to be able to teach the computer or at least we need to program the computer to require to have access to
00:40:10 and acquire learn the frameworks as well and connect the frameworks to the data I think this
00:40:20 I think this can be done I think we can start I think machine learnings for example with enough examples can start to learn
00:40:30 these basic dynamics will they relate the necessary to gravity not unless they can also acquire those theories as well
00:40:40 and put the experiential knowledge and connected back to the theoretical knowledge I think if we think in terms
00:40:47 of these class of architectures that are are designed to both learn the specifics find the patterns but also acquire the
00:40:55 frameworks and connect the data to the frameworks if we think in terms of robust architectures like this I think
00:41:02 there is a path toward getting there jeez in terms of encoding architectures like that do you think systems they were
00:41:11 able to do this will look like and you know that works or representing if you look back to the eighties and nineties
00:41:19 of the expert systems so more like graphs the systems that are based in logic able to contain a large amount of
00:41:27 knowledge where the challenge was the automated acquisition of that knowledge the I guess the question is when you
00:41:34 collect both the frameworks and the knowledge from the data what do you think that thing will look like yeah so
00:41:39 I mean I think think is asking a question they look like neural networks is a bit of a red herring I mean I think
00:41:44 that they they will they will certainly do inductive or pattern match based reasoning and I've already experimented
00:41:49 with architectures that combine both that use machine learning and neural networks to learn certain classes of
00:41:55 knowledge in other words to find repeated patterns in order or in order for it to make good inductive guesses
00:42:04 but then ultimately to try to take those learnings and and marry them in other words connect them to frameworks so that
00:42:12 it can then reason over that in terms of their humans understand so for example at elemental cognition we do both we
00:42:18 have architectures that that do both but both those things but also have a learning method for acquiring the
00:42:24 frameworks themselves and saying look ultimately I need to take this data I need to interpret it in the form of
00:42:30 these frameworks so they can reason over it so there is a fundamental knowledge representation like what you saying like
00:42:36 these graphs of logic if you will there are also neural networks that acquire certain class of information they then
00:42:44 they they and align them with these frameworks but there's also a mechanism to acquire the frameworks themselves yes
00:42:52 so it seems like the idea of framework requires some kind of collaboration with humans absolutely so do you think of
00:43:00 that collaboration as well and unless to be clear let's be clear only for the for the express purpose that you're
00:43:07 designing you you're designing machine designing and intelligence that can ultimately communicate with humans in
00:43:14 terms of frameworks that help them understand things right so so now to be really clear you can create you can
00:43:23 independently create an a machine learning system and an intelligent intelligence that I might call an
00:43:29 alien's elegans that does a better job than you with some things but can't explain the framework to you that
00:43:35 doesn't mean is it might be better than you at the thing it might be that you cannot comprehend the framework that it
00:43:41 may have created for itself that is inexplicable to you that's a reality but you're more interested in a case where
00:43:51 you can I I am yeah I per might sort of approach to AI is because I've set the goal for myself I want machines to be
00:44:00 able to ultimately communicate understanding with human I want to meet would acquire and communicate acquire
00:44:05 knowledge from humans and communicate knowledge to humans they should be using what you know inductive machine learning
00:44:14 techniques are good at which is to observe patterns of data whether it be in language or whether it be in images
00:44:24 or videos or whatever to acquire these patterns to induce the generalizations from those patterns but then ultimately
00:44:31 work with humans to connect them to frameworks interpretations if you will that ultimately make sense to humans of
00:44:37 course the machine is gonna have the strength egg it has the richer or longer memory but that you know it has the more
00:44:45 rigorous reasoning abilities the deeper reasoning abilities so be it interesting you know complementary relationship
00:44:53 between the human and the machine do you think that ultimately needs explained ability like a machine so if we look we
00:44:59 study for example Tesla autopilot a lot or humans I don't know if you've driven the vehicle or are aware of what is it
00:45:06 so you basically the human and machine are working together there and the human is
00:45:12 responsible for their own life to monitor the system and you know the system fails every few miles and so
00:45:20 there's there's hundreds of there's millions of those failures a day and so that's like a moment of interaction DC
00:45:28 yeah that's exactly right that's a moment of interaction where you know the the the machine has learned some stuff
00:45:36 it has a failure somehow the failures communicated the human is now filling in the mistake if
00:45:43 you will or maybe correcting or doing something that is more successful in that case the computer takes that
00:45:49 learning so I believe that the collaboration between human and machine I mean that's sort of a permanent
00:45:57 example of sort of a more another example is where the machine is literally talking to you and saying look
00:46:03 I'm I'm reading this thing I know I know that like the next word might be this or that but I don't really understand why I
00:46:10 have my gas can you help me understand the framework that supports this and then can kind of take acquire that take
00:46:17 that and reason about it and reuse it the next time it's reading to try to understand something not on not unlike a
00:46:25 human student might do I mean I remember like when my daughter was the first great in she was had a reading
00:46:33 assignment about electricity and you know somewhere in in the text it says and electricity is produced by water
00:46:39 flowing over turbines or something like that and then there's a question that says well how was electricity created
00:46:44 and so my daughter comes to me and says I mean I could you know created and produced or kind of synonyms in this
00:46:50 case so I can go back to the text and I can copy by water flowing over turbines but I have no idea what that means like
00:46:57 I don't know how to interpret water flowing over turbines and what electricity even is I mean I can get the
00:47:04 answer right by matching the text but I don't have any framework for understanding what this means at all and
00:47:10 framework really I mean it's a set of not to be mathematical but axioms of ideas that you bring to the table and
00:47:16 interpreting stuff and then you build those up somehow you build them up with the expert
00:47:23 that there's a shared understanding of what they are Sheriff it's the social network that us humans do you have a
00:47:32 sense that humans on earth in general share a set of like how many frameworks are there I mean it depends on how you
00:47:39 bound them right so in other words how big or small like their their individual scope but there's lots and there are new
00:47:46 ones I think they're I think the way I think about is kind of an a layer I think that the architectures are being
00:47:51 layered in that there's there's a small set of primitives that allow you the foundation to build frameworks and then
00:47:58 there may be you know many frameworks but you have the ability to acquire them and then you have the ability to reuse
00:48:04 them I mean one of the most compelling ways of thinking about this is or reasoning by analogy where I could say
00:48:09 oh wow I've learned something very similar you know I never heard of this I never heard of this game soccer but if
00:48:17 it's like basketball in the sense that the goals like the hoop and I have to get the ball in the hoop and I have
00:48:22 guards and I have this and I have that like we're weird is the where where are the similarities and where the
00:48:28 difference is and I have a foundation now for interpreting this new information and then the different
00:48:34 groups like the Millennials will have a framework and then and then well that you never you know yeah well Kratz and Republicans
00:48:42 well I Neal's nobody wants that framework well I mean I think understands it right I mean you're
00:48:47 talking about political and social ways of interpreting the world around them and I think these frameworks are still
00:48:53 largely largely similar I think they differ in maybe what some fundamental assumptions and values are now from a
00:49:00 reasoning perspective like the ability to process the framework of Magna might not be that different the implications
00:49:06 of different fundamental values or fundamental assumptions in those framework frameworks may reach very
00:49:13 different conclusions so from so from a social perspective that conclusions may be very different from an intelligence
00:49:19 perspective I you know I just followed where my assumptions took me yeah the product the process itself would look
00:49:24 similar but that's a fascinating idea that frameworks really helped carve how a statement will be interpreted
00:49:36 I mean having a Democrat and the Republican framework and read the exact same statement and the conclusions that
00:49:45 you derive would be totally different from an ad respective is fascinating what we would want out of the AI is to
00:49:51 be able to tell you that this perspective one perspective one set of assumptions is going to lead you here in
00:49:57 other setups as luncheons is gonna leave you there and to and in fact you know to help people reason and say oh I see
00:50:04 where I see where our differences lie yeah you know I have this fundamental belief about that I have this
00:50:09 fundamental belief about that yeah that's quite brilliant from my perspective and NLP there's this idea
00:50:14 that there's one way to really understand a statement but there probably isn't there's probably an
00:50:20 infinite number of ways then just as well well there's a lot finding on there's lots of different
00:50:25 interpretations and the you know the the broader you know the broader to the the contents the richer it is and so you
00:50:34 know you you and I can have very different experiences with the same text obviously and if we're committed to
00:50:43 understanding each other we start and that's the other important point like if we're committed to understanding each
00:50:50 other we start decomposing and breaking down our interpretation towards more and more primitive components until we get
00:50:56 to that point where we say oh I see why we disagree and we try to understand how fundamental that disagreement really is
00:51:04 but that requires a commitment to breaking down that interpretation in terms of that framework in a logical way
00:51:10 otherwise you know and this is why I like I think of a eyes is really complementing and helping human
00:51:17 intelligence to overcome some of its biases and its predisposition to be persuaded by you know buys but more
00:51:25 shallow reasoning in the sense that like we get over this idea well I you know you know I'm right because I'm a
00:51:30 Republican or I'm right because I'm democratic and someone labeled this is democratic point of view or it has the
00:51:36 following keywords in it and and if the machine can help us break that argument down and say wait a second you know what
00:51:42 do you really think about this right so essentially holding us accountable to doing more critical thinking
00:51:49 to sit and think about that as fast that's I love that I think that's really empowering use of AI for the public
00:51:57 discourse it's completely disintegrating currently I don't know as we learn how to do it on social medias right so one
00:52:06 of the greatest accomplishments in the history of AI is Watson competing against in a game of Jeopardy against
00:52:16 humans and you were a lead in that accrue at a critical part of that let's start the very basics what is the game
00:52:24 of Jeopardy the game for us humans human versus human right so it's to take a question and answer it actually no but
00:52:39 it's not right it's really not it's really it's really to get a question and answer but it's what we call a factoid
00:52:45 questions so this notion of like it's it really relates to some fact that everything few people would argue
00:52:50 whether the facts are true or not in fact most people what and jeopardy kind of counts on the idea that these these
00:52:59 statements have factual answers and and the idea is to first of all determine whether or not you know the answer which
00:53:06 is sort of an interesting twist so first of all understand the question you have to understand the question what is it
00:53:10 asking and that's a good point because the questions are not asked directly right they're all like the way the
00:53:18 questions are asked is nonlinear it's like it's a little bit witty it's a little bit playful sometimes it's a it's
00:53:26 a little bit tricky yeah they're asked and exactly in numerous witty tricky ways exactly what they're asking is not
00:53:34 obvious it takes it takes an experienced humans a while to go what is it even asking right and it's sort of an
00:53:39 interesting realization that you have was a missus Oh what's the Jeopardy is a question answering Shou and there's a go
00:53:44 like I know a lot and then you read it and you're you're still trying to process the question and the champions
00:53:49 have answered and moved on there's like there's three questions ahead at the time you figured out what the question
00:53:55 even met so there's there's definitely an ability there to just parse out what the question even is so that was
00:54:01 certainly challenging it's interesting historically though if you look back at the jeopardy games much earlier
00:54:08 you know 63 yeah and I think the questions were much more direct it weren't quite like that they got sort of
00:54:14 more and more interesting the way they asked them that sort of got more and more interesting and subtle and nuanced
00:54:20 and humorous and witty over time which really required the human to kind of make the right connections and figuring
00:54:26 out what the question was even asking so yeah you have to figure out the questions even asking then you have to
00:54:32 determine whether or not you think you know the answer and because you have to buzz in really quickly you sort of have
00:54:40 to make that determination as quickly as you possibly can otherwise you lose the opportunity buzz in you've been going
00:54:45 before you really know if you know the answer I think well I think a lot of humans will will assume they'll they'll
00:54:52 look at the look at their process of very superficially in other words what's the topic what are some key words and
00:54:58 just say do I know this area or not before they actually know the answer then they'll buzz in and then I'll buzz
00:55:03 in and think about it it's interesting what humans do now some people who know all things like Ken Jennings or
00:55:09 something or the more recent big jeopardy player that knows about that though just assume they know although
00:55:15 jeopardy and I'll just pose it you know Watson interestingly didn't even come close to knowing all of Jeopardy right
00:55:22 Watson even at the peak even at that's been yeah so for example I mean we had this thing called recall which is like
00:55:28 how many of all the Jeopardy questions you know how many did could we even find like find the right answer for like
00:55:35 anywhere like could we come up with if we look you know we had up a big body of knowledge some of the order of several
00:55:41 terabytes I mean from from a web scale was actually very small but from like a book scales talking about millions in
00:55:47 bucks right so the equivalent millions of books and cyclopædia is dictionaries books it's a ton of information and you
00:55:55 know for I think was 80 only 85% was the answer anywhere to be found so you're ready down you're ready down at
00:56:01 that level just to get just to get started right so and so was important to get a very quick sense of do you think
00:56:09 you know the right answer to this question so we have to compute that confidence as quickly as we possibly
00:56:15 could so it's in effect to answer it and at least you know spend some time essentially answering it and
00:56:24 then judging the confidence that we you know that that our answer was right and in deciding whether or not we were
00:56:30 confident enough to buzz in and that would depend on what else was going on in the game it could because it was a
00:56:34 risk so like if you're really in a situation where I have to take a gas I have very little to lose
00:56:39 then you'll buzz in with less confidence so that was the counter for the the financial standings of the different
00:56:45 competitors cracks yeah how much of the game was laughs how much time was left and where were you were in the standings
00:56:52 things like that what how many hundreds of milliseconds that we're talking about here do you have a sense of what is we
00:56:58 targets because we yeah was the targeted so I mean we targeted answering and under three seconds and buzzing it so
00:57:08 the decision to buzz in and then the actual answering are those two yes there were two there were two different things
00:57:14 in fact we had multiple stages whereas like we would say let's estimate our confidence which which is sort of a
00:57:21 shallow answering process and then ultimate and then ultimately decide to buzz in and then we may take another
00:57:28 second or something it's kind of go in there and and do that but by and large we're saying like we can't play the game
00:57:36 we can't even compete if we can't on average answer these questions and around three seconds or less
00:57:42 so you stepped in so there's this there's these three humans playing a game and you stepped in with the idea
00:57:49 that IBM Watson would be one of replaced one of the humans and compete against two can you tell the story of Watson
00:57:57 taking on this game sure seems exceptionally difficult yeah so the story was that it was or it was
00:58:04 coming up I think the 10-year anniversary of a big blue an optical deep blues IBM wanted to do sort of
00:58:12 another kind of really you know fun challenge public challenge that can bring attention to IBM research and the
00:58:19 kind of cool stuff that we were doing I had been working in an AI at IBM for some time I had a team doing what's
00:58:27 called open domain factoids question-answering which is you know we're not gonna tell you what the
00:58:31 questions are we're not even gonna tell you what they're about can you go off and get accurate answers
00:58:38 to these questions and it was an area of AI research that I was involved in and so it was a big Pat it was a very
00:58:44 specific passion of mine language understanding and always always been a passion of mine one sort of narrow slice
00:58:50 on whether or not you could do anything was language was this notion of open domain and meaning I could ask anything
00:58:54 about anything factoids meaning it essentially had an answer and and you know being able to do
00:59:01 that accurately and quickly so that was a research area that might even already been in and so completely independently
00:59:08 several you know IBM exactly there's like what are we gonna do what's the next cool thing to do and Ken Jennings
00:59:14 was on his winning streak this was like whatever was 2004 I think was on his win winning streak when someone thought hey
00:59:22 that'd be really cool if the computer can play jeopardy and so this was like in 2004 they were shopping this thing
00:59:29 around and everyone who's telling the the research execs no way like this is crazy and we had some pretty you know senior
00:59:37 people know if you'll understand the others crazy and he'll come across my desk and I was like but that's kind of
00:59:42 what what I'm really interested in doing and but there was such this prevailing sense of this is nots we're not going to
00:59:49 risk IBM's reputation on this we're just not doing it and this happened in 2004 it happened in 2005 at the end of 2006
00:59:59 it was coming around again and I was coming off of a I was doing that the open domain question-answering stuff but
01:00:05 I was coming off a couple other projects I had a lot more time to put into this and I argued that it could be done and I
01:00:12 argue it would be crazy not to do this can I you could be honest at this point so
01:00:18 even though you argued for it what's the confidence that you had yourself privately that this could be done it was
01:00:25 we just totally told the story of how you tell stories to convince others how confident were you what was your
01:00:31 estimation of the problem at that time so I thought it was possible and a lot of people thought it
01:00:36 was impossible I thought it was possible a reason why I thought it was possible is because I did some brief
01:00:42 experimentation I knew a lot about how we were approaching on open domain factoids question asked me we have been
01:00:48 doing it for some years I looked at the Japanese stuff I said this is going to be hard for a lot of the points that you
01:00:54 mentioned earlier hard to interpret the question hard to do it quickly enough hard to compute an accurate confidence
01:01:01 none of this stuff had been done well enough before but a lot of the technologies were building with the
01:01:06 kinds of technologies that should work but more to the point what was driving me was I was an IBM research I was a
01:01:15 senior leader in IBM Research and this is the kind of stuff we were supposed to do we were basically supposed to the
01:01:20 moonshot this is I mean we were supposed to take things and say this is an active research area it's our obligation to
01:01:28 kind of if we have the opportunity to push it to the limits and if it doesn't work to understand more deeply why we
01:01:36 can't do it and so I was very committed to that notion saying folks this is what we do it's crazy not not to do this is
01:01:44 an active research area we've been in this for years why wouldn't we take this Grand Challenge and and push it as hard
01:01:52 as we can at the very least we'd be able to come out and say here's why this problem is is way hard here's what we've
01:01:59 tried and here's how we failed so I was very driven as a scientist from that perspective and then I also argued based
01:02:08 on what we did a feasibility study oh why I thought it was hard but possible and I showed examples of you know where
01:02:14 it succeeded where it failed why it failed and sort of a high level architecture approach for why we should
01:02:21 do it but for the most part that at that point the execs really were just looking for someone crazy enough to say yes
01:02:27 because for several years at that point everyone has said no I'm not willing to risk my reputation and my career you
01:02:35 know on this thing clearly you did not have such fears okay I did not say you died right in and yet for what I
01:02:43 understand it was performing very poorly in the beginning so what were the initial approaches and
01:02:52 why did they fail well there were lots of hard aspects to it I mean one of the reasons why prior approaches that we had
01:03:00 worked on in the past failed was because of because the questions were difficult difficult to
01:03:08 interpret like what are you even asking for right very often like if if the question was very direct like what city
01:03:15 you know or what you know even then it could be tricky but but you know what city or what person was often when it
01:03:24 would name it very clearly you would know that and and if there was just a small set of them in other words we're
01:03:31 gonna ask about these five types like it's gonna be an answer and the answer will be a city in this state or a city
01:03:38 in this country the answer will be a person of this type right like an actor or whatever it is but turns out that in
01:03:45 jeopardy there were like tens of thousands of these things and it was a very very long tale meaning you know
01:03:53 that it just went on and on and and so even if you focused on trying to encode the types at the very top like there's
01:04:00 five that were the most let's say five of the most frequent you still cover a very small percentage of the data so you
01:04:06 couldn't take that approach of saying I'm just going to try to collect facts about these five or ten types or twenty
01:04:14 types or fifty types or whatever so that was like one of the first things like what do you do about that and so we came
01:04:21 up with a an approach toward that and the approach to look promising and we we continue to improve our abilities to
01:04:28 handle that problem throughout the project the other issue was that right from the outside I said we're not going
01:04:36 to I committed to doing this in three five years so we did in four so I got lucky but one of the things that that
01:04:44 putting that like stake in the ground was I and I knew how hard the language of the standard problem was I said we're
01:04:51 not going to actually understand language to solve this problem we are not going to
01:04:58 interpret the question and the domain of knowledge the question refers to in reason over that to answer these
01:05:03 questions were obviously we're not going to be doing that at the same time simple search wasn't good enough to confidently
01:05:11 answer with this you know a single correct answer first others like brilliant that's such a great mix of
01:05:17 innovation in practical engineering three three four eight so you're not you're not trying to solve the general
01:05:23 NLU problem you're saying let's solve this in any way possible oh yeah no I was committed to saying look we're gonna
01:05:29 solving the open the main question answering problem we're using jeopardy as a driver for that management hard
01:05:37 enough big benchmark exactly and now we're how do we do it we're just like whatever like just figure out what works
01:05:42 because I want to be able to go back to the académica scientific community and say here's what we tried here's what
01:05:48 work here's what didn't work I don't want to go in and say oh I only have one technology hammer and only gonna use
01:05:54 this I'm gonna do whatever it takes I'm like I'm gonna think out of the box do whatever it takes one and I also
01:06:00 Baloo's another thing I believed I believe that the fundamental NLP technologies and machine learning
01:06:08 technologies would be would be adequate and this was an issue of how do we enhance them how do we integrate them
01:06:15 how do we advance them so I had one researcher and came to me who had been working on question answering with me
01:06:21 for a very long time who had said we're gonna need Maxwell's equations for question-answering and I
01:06:28 said if we if we need some fundamental formula that breaks new ground and how we understand language we're screwed
01:06:34 yeah we're not gonna get there from here like we I am not counting I am that my assumption is I'm not counting on some
01:06:43 brand new invention what I'm counting on is the ability to take everything that has done before to figure out a an
01:06:51 architecture on how to integrate it well and then see where it breaks and make the necessary advances we need to make
01:06:58 and sold this thing works yeah push it hard to see where it breaks and then patch it up I mean that's how
01:07:03 people change the world and that's the you know mosque approaches Rockets SpaceX that's the Henry Ford and so on a
01:07:10 lot and and I happen to be and in this case I happen to be right but but like we didn't know right but you kind of
01:07:16 have to put a second or so how you gonna run the project so yep and backtracking to search so if you were to do what's
01:07:25 the brute force solution what what would you search over so you have a question how would you search the possible space
01:07:32 of answers look web search has come a long way even since then but at the time like you know you first of all I mean
01:07:38 there are a couple of other constraints around the problems interesting so you couldn't go out to the web you couldn't
01:07:45 search the Internet in other words the AI experiment was we want a self-contained device device if devices
01:07:53 as big as a room fine it's as big as a room but we want a self-contained advice contained device you're not going out
01:07:59 the internet you don't have a life lifeline to anything so it had to kind of fit in a shoebox if you will or at
01:08:06 least the size of a few refrigerators whatever it might be see but also you couldn't just get out
01:08:11 there you couldn't go off Network right to kind of go so there was that limitation but then we did it but the
01:08:17 basic thing was go go do what go do a web search the problem was even when we went and did a web search I don't
01:08:25 remember exactly the numbers but someone the order of 65% at a time the answer would be somewhere you know in the top
01:08:33 10 or 20 documents so first of all that's not even good enough to play Jack pretty you know the words even if you
01:08:38 could pull the avian if you could perfectly pull the answer out of the top 20 documents top 10 documents whatever
01:08:45 was which we didn't know how to do but even if you could that do that your you'd be at and you knew it was Ryan
01:08:50 Lizza we've had enough confidence in it right so you have to pull out the right answer you have you depth of confidence
01:08:55 it was the right answer and and then you'd have to do that fast enough to now go buzz in and you'd still only get 65%
01:09:01 of them right with nine doesn't even put you in the winner's circle winner's circle you have to be up over 70 and you
01:09:06 have to do it really quick and you do really quickly but now the problem is well even if I had somewhere in the top
01:09:13 10 documents how do I figure out where in the top 10 documents that answer is and how do i compute a confidence of all
01:09:20 the possible candidates so it's not like I go in knowing the right answer and I have to pick it I don't know the right
01:09:25 answer I have a bunch of documents somewhere in there's the right answer how do i as a machine go out and figure
01:09:30 out which ones right and then how do I score it so and now how do I deal with the fact that I can't actually go out to
01:09:38 the web first of all if you pause and then just think about it if you could go to the web do you think that problem is
01:09:45 solvable if you just pause on it just thinking even beyond jeopardy do you think the problem of reading text
01:09:54 defined where the answer is but we saw we solved that and some definition of solves given the Jeopardy challenge how
01:09:59 did you do it forever so how did you take a body of work and a particular topic and extract the key pieces of
01:10:07 information so what so now forgetting about the the huge volumes that are on the web right so now we have to figure
01:10:12 out we did a lot of source research in other words what body of knowledge is gonna be small enough but broad enough
01:10:20 to answer Jeffrey and we ultimately did find the body of knowledge that did that I mean it included Wikipedia and a bunch
01:10:26 of other stuff so like encyclopedia type of stuff I don't know if you use Mary's different types of semantic resources
01:10:32 unlike wordnet and other types of Mantic resources like that as well as like some web crawls in other words where we went
01:10:39 out and took that content and then expanded it based on producing statistical see you know statistically
01:10:45 producing sees using those sees for other searchers searches and then expanding that so using these like
01:10:52 expansion techniques we went out and had found enough content and we're like okay this is good and we even up and totally
01:10:57 and you know we had a threat of resources always trying to figure out what content could we efficiently
01:11:03 include I mean there's a lot of popular cut like what is the church lady well I think was one of the end hey yeah what
01:11:11 we ready I guess that's probably an encyclopedia so it's a pepino is that but then we would but then we would take
01:11:16 that stuff when we would go out and we would expand in other words we go find other content that wasn't in the core
01:11:23 resources and expanded you know the amount of content will grew it by an order of magnitude but still so again
01:11:28 from a web scale perspective this is very small amount of content it's very select we then we then took all that
01:11:34 content so we we pre analyzed the crap out of it meaning we we we parsed it you know broke it down into all this
01:11:41 individual words and then we did semantic static and semantic parses on it you know had computer algorithms that
01:11:48 annotated it and we in that we indexed that in a very rich and very fast index so we have a relatively huge amount of
01:11:56 you know let's say the equivalent of for the sake of argument two to five million bucks we've now analyzed all that blowing up
01:12:02 at size even more because now with all this metadata and we then we richly indexed all of that and in by way in a
01:12:10 giant in-memory cache so Watson did not go to disk so the infrastructure component there if you just speak to it
01:12:19 how tough it I mean I know mm maybe this is 2089 you know that that's kind of a long time
01:12:25 ago right how hard is it to use multiple machines Olivia how hard is the infrastructure
01:12:31 part of the hardware component we used IBM we so we used IBM hardware we had something like I figured exactly but
01:12:39 2,000 to 3,000 cores completely connected so had a switch were you know every CPU was connected to every other
01:12:44 scene they were sharing memory in some kind of way Lauren up close shared memory right and all this data was pre
01:12:53 analyzed and put into a very fast indexing structure that was all all all in all in memory and then
01:13:03 we took that question we would analyze the question so all the content was now pre analyzed so if I so if I went and
01:13:10 tried to find a piece of content it would come back with all the metadata that we had pre computed how do you
01:13:17 shove that question how do you connect the the big stuff with the meta the the big knowledgebase of the metadata and
01:13:23 that's indexed to the simple little witty confusing question right so therein lies
01:13:31 you know the Watson architects right so we would take the question we would analyze the question so which means that
01:13:37 we would parse it and interpret it a bunch of different ways we try to figure out what is it asking about so we would
01:13:44 come we had multiple strategies to kind of determine what was it asking for that might be represented as a simple string
01:13:52 and character string or was something we would connect back to different semantic types that were from existing resources
01:13:58 so anyway the bottom line is we would do a bunch of analysis and the question and question analysis had to finish and had
01:14:04 to finish fast so we do the question analysis because then from the question analysis we would now produce searches
01:14:13 so we would and we had built using open source search engines we modified them we had a number of different search
01:14:19 engines we would use that had different characteristics we went in there and engineered and modified those search
01:14:27 engines ultimately to now take our question analysis produce multiple queries based on different
01:14:33 interpretations of the question and fire out a whole bunch of searches in parallel and they would produce combate
01:14:41 with passages so this is these are passive search algorithms they would come back with passages and so now you
01:14:47 let's say you had a thousand passages now for each passage you you parallel eyes again so you went out and you
01:14:56 paralyze those paralyze the search each search would now come back with a whole bunch of passages maybe you had a total
01:15:02 of a thousand or five thousand different passages for each passage now you don't figure out whether or not there was a
01:15:07 candidate it would call it candidate answer in there so you had a whole bunch of other a whole bunch of other algorithms
01:15:13 that would find candidate answers possible answers to the question and so you had candidate answers jet cold
01:15:20 candidate answers generators a whole bunch of those so for every one of these components the team was constantly doing
01:15:26 research coming up better ways to generate search queries from the questions better ways to analyze the
01:15:31 question better ways to generate candidates and speed so better is accuracy and speed cracked so right and
01:15:39 speed and accuracy for the most part we're separated we handle that sort of in separate ways like I focus purely on
01:15:45 accuracy and to an accuracy are we ultimately getting more questions and producing more accurate confidences and
01:15:50 they had a whole nother team that was constantly analyzing the workflow to find the bottlenecks and then if you're
01:15:56 getting out of both parallel eyes and drive the algorithm speed but anyway so so now think of it like you have this
01:16:02 big fan out now right because you have you had multiple queries now you have now you have thousands of candidate
01:16:08 answers for each candidate answer you're gonna score it so you're gonna use all the data that built up you're gonna use
01:16:16 the question analysis you can use how the query was generated you're going to use the passage itself and you're going
01:16:22 to use the candidate answer that was generated and you're gonna score that so now we have a group of researchers
01:16:30 coming up with scores there are hundreds of different scores so now you're getting a fan at it again from however
01:16:37 many candidate answers you have to all the different scorers so if you have a 200 different scores and you never a
01:16:42 thousand candidates now you have two thousand scores and and so now you got to figure out you know how do I now rank
01:16:52 these rank these answers based on the scores that came back and I want to rank them based on the likelihood that there
01:16:58 are correct answer to the question so every score was its own research project what do you mean by score so is that the
01:17:05 annotation process of basically human being saying that this this answer do you think you think of if you want to
01:17:12 think of it what you're doing you know if you want to think about what a human would be doing human would be looking at
01:17:18 a possible answer they'd be reading the you know Emily Dixon Dickinson they've been reading the passage in which that
01:17:24 occurred they'd be looking at the question they'd be making a decision of how likely it is that Emily Dixon Dickinson
01:17:32 given this evidence in this passage is the right answer to that quad got it so that that's the annotation task that
01:17:39 Stan Johnson scoring task so but scoring implies zero to one kind of trite continuance is not a binary no give it a
01:17:48 score give it a zero yeah exactly so it's what humans did give different scores so that you have to somehow
01:17:52 normalize and all that kind of stuff that deal with all that depends on what your strategy is we both we could be
01:17:59 relative to it could be we actually looked at the raw scores as well standardized scores because humans are
01:18:04 not involved in this humans are not involved sorry so I mean I'm misunderstanding the the the process
01:18:11 here this is passages where is the ground truth coming from grass root there's only there were answers to the
01:18:17 questions so it's end to end it's end to end so we also I was always driving and and performance a very
01:18:25 interesting a very interesting you know engineering approach and ultimately scientific and researcher personal
01:18:32 always driving in 10 now that's not to say we wouldn't make hypotheses that individual component performance was
01:18:44 related in some way to n10 performance of course we would because people would have to build individual components but
01:18:50 ultimately to get your component integrates with the system you had to show impact on end-to-end performance
01:18:56 question-answering performance as there's many very smart people work on this and they're basically trying to
01:19:02 sell their ideas as a component that should be part of the system that's right and and they would do research on
01:19:08 their component and they would say things like you know I'm going to improve this as a candidate generator
01:19:15 I'm going to improve this as a question score or as a passive scorer I'm going to proved as or as a parser and I can
01:19:24 improve it by two percent on its component metric like a better parse or better candidate or a better type
01:19:30 estimation or whatever it is and then I would say I need to understand how the improvement on that computer metric is
01:19:36 going to affect the end-to-end performance if you can't estimate that and can't do experiments to
01:19:42 demonstrate that it doesn't get in that's like the best run AI project I've ever heard that's awesome okay what
01:19:52 breakthrough would you say like I'm sure there's a lot of day to day break this but it was there like a breakthrough
01:19:57 that really helped improve performance like wait what people began to believe or is it just a gradual process well I
01:20:06 think it was a gradual process but one of the things that I think gave people confidence that we can get there was
01:20:13 that as we fouled as as we follow this procedure of different ideas build different components plug them into the
01:20:21 architecture run the system see how we do do the error analysis start off new research projects to improve things and
01:20:31 the and and and the very important idea that the individual component work did not have to deeply understand everything
01:20:41 that was going on with every other component and this is where we we leverage machine learning in a very
01:20:48 important way so while individual components could be statistically driven machine learning components some of them
01:20:53 were your wrist ik some of them were machine learning components the system has a whole combined all the scores
01:21:01 using machine learning this was critical because that way you can divide and conquer so you can say okay you work on
01:21:08 your candidate generator or you work on this approach to answer scoring you work on this approach to type scoring you
01:21:14 work on this approach to passage search or the passive selection and so forth but when we you just plug it in and we
01:21:22 had enough training data to say now we can we can train and figure out how do we weigh all the scores relative to each
01:21:31 other based on the predicting the outcome which is right right or wrong on jeopardy and we had enough training data
01:21:38 to do that so this enabled people to work independently and to let the machine learning do the integration
01:21:44 beautiful so that yeah the machine learning is doing the fusion and then it's a human orchestrated ensemble
01:21:51 that's right friend approaches as a great still impressive they were able to get it done a few years that not obvious
01:22:01 to me that it's doable if I just put myself in that mindset but when you look back at the Jeopardy challenge again
01:22:10 when you're looking up at the stars what are you most proud of looking back at commitment and my team's commitment to
01:22:36 be true to the science to not be afraid to fail that's beautiful because there's so much pressure because it is a public
01:22:44 event this is a public show that you do you think it was a success in the eyes of the world it was a success by
01:22:58 your I'm sure exceptionally high standards is there something you regret you would do differently
01:23:09 it was a success it was a success for our goal our goal was to build the most advanced open domain question-answering
01:23:18 system we went back to the old problems that we used to try to solve and we did dramatically better on all of them as
01:23:26 well as we beat jeopardy so we wanted jeopardy so it was it was a success it was I worried that the world would not
01:23:37 understand that has success because it came down to only one game and I knew statistically speaking this can be a
01:23:42 huge technical success and we could still lose that one game and that's a whole nother theme of this of the
01:23:50 journey but it was a success it was not a success in natural language understanding but that was not the goal
01:24:00 yeah that was but I would argue I understand what you're saying in terms of the science but I would argue that
01:24:09 the inspiration of it right the they not a success in terms of solving natural language understanding there was a
01:24:15 success of being an inspiration to future challenges absolutely drive future efforts what's the difference
01:24:24 between how human being compete in jeopardy and how Watson does it that's important in terms of intelligence yeah
01:24:30 so thats that actually came out very early on in the project also in fact I had people who wanted to be on the
01:24:36 project who were early on who has sort of approached me once I committed to do it had wanted to
01:24:44 think about how humans do it and they were you know from a cognition perspective like human cognition and how
01:24:51 that should play and I would not take them on the project because another assumption or another stake I put in the
01:24:58 ground was I don't really care are you into this at least in the context of this prior need to build in the context
01:25:05 to this project in NLU and in building an AI that understands how it needs to alter that communicate with humans I
01:25:12 very much care yeah so wasn't that I didn't care in general in fact as an AI scientist I care a lot about that but
01:25:23 I'm also a practical engineer and I committed to getting this thing done and I wasn't gonna get distracted I had to
01:25:30 kind of say look if I'm gonna get this done and when it charts this path and this path says we're gonna engineer a
01:25:37 machine that's gonna get this thing done and we know what search and NLP can do we have to build on that foundation if I
01:25:45 come in and take a different approach and start wondering about how the human mind might or might not do this I'm not
01:25:52 going to get there from here in the time and you know in the timeframe I think that's a great way to lead the team but
01:25:59 now there's done and then one when you look back right so analyse what's the difference sexy right so so I was a
01:26:05 little bit surprised actually to discover over time as this would come up from time to time and would reflect on
01:26:14 it that and and talking to Ken Jennings a little bit and hearing Ken Jennings talk about it about how he answered
01:26:19 questions that it might have been closer to the way humans answer questions than I might have imagined previously because
01:26:26 humans are probably in the game of Jeopardy at the level of Ken Jennings probably also cheating their weight into
01:26:36 winning right now one else is shallow they're doing that fast as possible they're doing shallow analysis so they
01:26:44 are very quickly analyzing the question and coming up with some you know key you know key vectors or cues if you will and
01:26:50 they're taking those cue they're very quickly going through like their library of stuff not deeply
01:26:57 reasoning about what's going on and then sort of like a lots of different like what we call these these scores which
01:27:05 kind of score that in a very shallow way and then say oh boom you know that's what it is and and so it's interesting
01:27:13 as we reflected on that so we may be doing something that's not too far off from the way humans do it but we certain
01:27:21 certainly didn't approach it by saying you know how would you even do this now in an elemental cognition like the
01:27:27 project I'm leading now we asked those questions all the time because ultimately we're trying to do something
01:27:34 that is to make the the the intelligence in the machine and the intelligence of the human very compatible
01:27:38 well compatible in the sense they can communicate with one another and they can reason with this shared
01:27:45 understanding so how they think about things and how they build answers how they build explanations becomes a very
01:27:52 important question to consider so what's the difference between this open domain but cold constructed question answering
01:28:05 or jeopardy and more something that requires understanding for shared communication with humans and machines
01:28:11 yeah well this goes back to the interpretation of what we were talking about before anyway jeopardy the systems
01:28:19 on trying to interpret the question and that's not interpreting the content that's reasoning and with regard to any
01:28:24 particular framework I mean it's it is parsing it and like parsing the contents and using grammatical cues and stuff
01:28:30 like that so if you think of grammar as a human framework in some sense and as that but when you get into the richer
01:28:37 semantic frameworks what are people how do they think what motivates them what are the events that are occurring and
01:28:43 why are they occurring and what causes what else to happen and and and when it where are things in time and space and
01:28:48 it's like when you started thinking about how humans formulate and structure the knowledge that they acquire in their
01:28:57 head and wasn't doing any of that what do you think are the essential challenges of like free flowing
01:29:04 communication free flowing log versus question-answering even with the framework of the interpretation
01:29:11 dialogue yep do you see free-flowing dialogue as a fundamentally more difficult than
01:29:23 question answering even with shared so dialogue is as important in number of different ways I mean it's a challenge
01:29:29 so first of all when I think about the machine that when I think about a machine that understands language and
01:29:36 ultimately can reason in an objective way that can take the information that it perceives through language or other
01:29:43 means and connects it back to these frameworks reason and explain itself that system ultimately needs to be able
01:29:51 to talk to humans or I needs to be able to interact with humans so in some sentence to dialogue that doesn't mean
01:29:59 that it it that like sometimes people talk about dialogue and they think you know how do humans talk how do you
01:30:06 montork talk to each other in a casual conversation then you could mimic casual conversations we're not trying to mimic
01:30:14 casual conversations we're really trying to produce the machine as goal is it is to help you think and help you reason
01:30:23 about your answers and explain why so instead of like talking to your friend down the street about having a smoke
01:30:28 having a small talk conversation with your friend down the street this is more about like you would be communicating to
01:30:34 the commuter computer on Star Trek we're like what do you want to think about like what do you want to reason about
01:30:38 I'm going to tell you the information I have I'm gonna have to summarize it I'm gonna ask you questions you're gonna
01:30:43 answer those questions I'm gonna go back and forth with you I'm gonna figure out what your mental model is I'm gonna I'm
01:30:49 gonna now relate that to the information I have and present it to you in a way that you can understand it and we could
01:30:55 ask follow-up questions so it's that type of dialogue that you want to construct it's more structured it's more
01:31:03 goal oriented but it needs to be fluid in other words it can't it can't it has to be engaging and fluid it has to be
01:31:13 productive and not distracting so there has to be a model of the words the machine has to have a model of how
01:31:21 humans think through things and discuss them so basically a productive rich conversation unlike this part yes but
01:31:34 what I'd like to think it's more similar to this pocket as in joking I'll ask you about humor as well actually but what's
01:31:43 the hardest part of that because it seems we were quite far away as a community from thats though to be able
01:31:51 to so one is having a shared understanding as i think a lot of the stuff you said with frameworks is quite brilliant
01:32:01 but just creating a smooth discourse yeah it feels clunky right now well which aspects of this whole problem you
01:32:11 just specified all having a productive conversation is the hardest and that were or maybe maybe any aspect of it you
01:32:19 can comment on because it's so shrouded in mystery so I think do this you kind of have to be creative in the following
01:32:28 sense if I were to do this is purely a machine learning approach and someone said learn how to have a good flue in
01:32:35 structured knowledge acquisition conversation I'd go out and say okay I have to collect a bunch of data of
01:32:44 people doing that people reasoning well having a good structured conversation that both acquires knowledge efficiently
01:32:51 as well as produces answers and explanations as part of the process and you struggle I don't know
01:32:59 elect a day to collect the data because I don't know how much data is like that I think okay okay so this one there's a
01:33:11 human but also even if it's out there say was out there how do you like alright so I think I think like an
01:33:18 accessible right so I think any like any problem like this where you don't have enough data to represent the phenomenon
01:33:25 you want to learn in other words you want you if you have enough data you could potentially learn the pattern in
01:33:30 an example like this it's hard to do it this is the you know Susie sort of a human sort of thing to do what you
01:33:36 recently came out IBM was the debate or projects and surest thing right because now you had you do have these structured
01:33:42 dialogues these debate things where they did use machine learning techniques to generate the you know generate these
01:33:50 debates dialogues are a little bit tougher in my opinion than generating a a structured argument where you have
01:33:57 lots of other structural arguments like this you could potentially annotate that data and you could say this is a good
01:34:01 response a bad response in a particular domain here I have to be responsive and I have to be
01:34:10 opportunistic with regard to what is the human saying what so I'm goal-oriented and saying I want to solve the problem I
01:34:15 want to acquire the knowledge necessary but I also have to be opportunistic and responsive to what the human is saying
01:34:23 so I think that it's not clear that we could just train on a body of data to do this but we could bootstrap it in other
01:34:30 words we can be creative and we could say what do we think what do we think the structure of a good dialogue is that
01:34:36 does this well and we can start to create that if we can if we can create that more programmatic programmatically
01:34:44 at least to get this process started and I can create a tool that now engages humans effectively I could start both I
01:34:51 could start generating data I could start with the human learning process and I can update my machine but I can
01:34:56 also start the automatic learning process as well but I have to understand what features to even learn over so I
01:35:03 have to bootstrap the process a little bit first and that's a creative design task that I could then use as input into
01:35:13 a more automatic learning task this is some creativity and bootstrapping all right what elements of conversation do
01:35:22 you think you would like to see so one of the benchmarks for me is humor right that seems to be one of the hardest if
01:35:29 you end to me the biggest contrast is from Watson so one of the greatest sketches of comedy sketches of all time
01:35:38 right is the SNL celebrity jeopardy with  with with Alex Trebek and Sean Connery and Burt Reynolds and so on with
01:35:46  with the Sean Connery commentating on Alex Trebek smile there a lot so and I think all of them are in the negative
01:35:53 point what's why so they're clearly all losing in terms of the game of Jeopardy but they're winning in terms of comedy
01:36:02 so what do you think about humor in this whole interaction in the dialogue that's productive or even just whatever what
01:36:13 human represents to me is it the same idea that you're saying about a framework because humor only exists
01:36:17 within a particular human framework so what do you think about humor what do you think about things like humor that
01:36:23 connect to the kind of creativity you mentioned that's needed I think there's a couple things going on there so I I I
01:36:30 sort of feel like and I might be too optimistic this way but I think that there are we did a little bit about with
01:36:38 with this and with puns and in jeopardy we literally sat down and said well you know how do puns work and you know it's
01:36:45 like wordplay and you could formalize these things so I think there's a lot aspects of humor that you could
01:36:51 formalize you could also learn new Murr you could just say what do people laugh at and if you have enough again if you
01:36:56 have enough data to represent the phenomenon you know might be able to you know weigh the features and figure out
01:37:01 you know what humans find funny and what they don't find funny you might the Machine might not be able
01:37:06 to explain why the my buddy unless we unless we sit back and think about that more formally I think again I think you
01:37:13 do a combination of both and I'm always a big proponent that I think you know robust architectures and approaches are
01:37:18 always a little bit combination of us reflecting and being creative about how things are structured and how to
01:37:24 formalize them and then taking advantage of large data and doing learning and figuring how to combine these two
01:37:29 approaches I think there's another aspect of human to human though which goes to the idea that I feel like I can
01:37:35 relate to the person telling the story telling the person telling the story and I think that's that's a interesting
01:37:45 theme in the whole AI theme which is do I feel differently when I know it's a robot and when I know when I imagine
01:37:52 there's a row but is not conscious the way I'm conscious when they imagine the robot does not actually have the
01:37:59 experiences that I experience do I find it you know funny or do because it's not as related I don't imagine that the
01:38:06 person is relating it to it the way I relate to it I think this also you see this in in the arts and in entertainment
01:38:14 where like you know sometimes you have savants who are remarkable at a thing whether it's sculpture it's music or
01:38:20 whatever but the people who get the most attention are the people who can't who can evoke a similar emotional response
01:38:31 who can get you to emote right about the way they in other words who can basically make
01:38:35 the connection from the artifact from the music of the painting of the sculpture to the to the emotion and get
01:38:41 you to share that emotion with them and then and that's when it becomes compelling so they're communicating at a
01:38:47 whole different level they're just not communicating the artifact they're communicating their emotional response
01:38:52 to the artifact and then you feel like oh wow I can relate to that person I can connect to that I can connect to that
01:38:58 person so I think humor has that has that aspect as well so the idea that you can connect to that person person being
01:39:09 the critical thing but we're also able to anthropomorphize objects pretty robots and AI systems pretty well
01:39:17 so we're almost looking to make them human there may be from your experience with Watson maybe you can comment on did
01:39:25 you consider that as part well obviously the problem of Jeopardy doesn't require int the promotoras ation but
01:39:31 nevertheless well there was some interest in doing that and I've that's an that's another thing I didn't want to
01:39:36 do so I didn't want to distract from the from the actual scientific test nights so you're absolutely right I mean humans
01:39:44 do anthropomorphize and and without necessarily a lot of work I mean just put some eyes in a couple of eyebrow
01:39:50 movements and you're getting humans to react emotionally and I and I think you can do that so I didn't mean to suggest
01:39:59 that that that connection can't cannot be mimicked I think that connection can be mimicked and can get you to can
01:40:07 produce that emotional response I just wonder though if you're told what's really going on if you know that the
01:40:17 machine is not conscious not having the same richness of emotional reactions and understanding that doesn't really share
01:40:23 the understanding but is essentially just moving inside brow or drooping its eyes or making them big or whatever it's
01:40:29 doing that's getting the emotional response will you still feel it interesting I think you probably would
01:40:35 for a while and then when it becomes more important that there's a deeper under depreciate understanding it may
01:40:41 run flat but I don't know I'm pretty I'm pretty confident that it will the majority of the world even if you
01:40:48 tell them how no matter well it will not matter especially if the Machine herself says that she is cautious that's very
01:40:57 possible so you the scientists that made the machine is saying that this is how the algorithm works everybody will just
01:41:04 assume you're lying and that there's a conscious being there so you're deep into the science fiction shop you're on
01:41:10 right now but yeah I think it's actually psychology I think it's not science fiction I think it's reality I think it's a
01:41:18 really powerful one that will have to be exploring in the next few decades it's a very interesting element of intelligence
01:41:25 so what do you think we've talked about social constructs of intelligences and and frameworks and the way humans kind
01:41:34 of interpret information what do you think is a good test of intelligence in your view so there's the Alan Turing
01:41:40 with the Turing test Watson accomplished something very impressive with Jeopardy what do you
01:41:48 think is a test that would impress the heck out of you that you saw that a computer could do they say this is
01:41:57 crossing a kind of threshold that's that expectations for a are generally high what does high look like by the way so
01:42:09 not the threshold test as a threshold what do you think is the destination what do you think is the ceiling
01:42:18 I think machines will in many measures will be better than us will become more effective in other words better
01:42:25 predictors about a lot of things and then then then ultimately we can do I think where they're gonna struggle is
01:42:33 what we talked about before which is relating to communicating with and understanding humans in deeper ways and
01:42:42 and so I think that's a key point like we can create the super parrot what I mean by the super parrot is given enough
01:42:49 data a machine can mimic your emotional response can even generate language that will sound smart and what someone else
01:42:56 might say under similar circumstances look how its paws on that like that's a super parrot right so given similar
01:43:05 circumstances moves its face its faces in similar ways changes its tone of voice in similar ways produce the
01:43:11 strings of language that you know would similar that a human might say not necessarily being able to produce a
01:43:19 logical interpretation or understanding that would ultimately satisfy a critical interrogation or a critical
01:43:28 understanding I think you guys describe me in a nutshell I think I think philosophically speaking
01:43:36 you could argue that that's all we're doing as human beings to war so I was gonna say it's very possible you know
01:43:42 humans do behave that way too and so upon deeper probing and deeper interrogation you may find out that
01:43:48 there isn't a shared understanding because I think humans do both like humans are statistical language model
01:43:56 machines and and and they are capable reasoner's you know they're they're both and you don't know which is going on
01:44:05 right so and I think it's I think it's an interesting problem we talked earlier about like where we are in our social
01:44:15 and political landscape can you distinguish some who can string words together and sound
01:44:20 like they know what they're talking about from someone who actually does can you do that without dialogue without
01:44:29 integrity of a programming dialogue so it's interesting because humans are really good at in their own mind
01:44:35 justifying or explaining what they hear because they project their understanding on onto yours so you could say you could
01:44:43 put together a string of words and and someone will sit there and interpret in a way that's extremely biased this is
01:44:48 the way they want to interpret it they want to assuming you're an idiot and they'll true put it one way they've all
01:44:53 seen you're a genius and interpreted another way that suits their needs so this is tricky business so I think the
01:45:01 answer your question as AI gets better and better at better and better mimic you we create the super parrots we're
01:45:08 challenged just as we are with we're challenged with humans do you really know what you're talking about do you
01:45:16 have a meaningful interpretation a powerful framework that you could reason over and justify your answers justify
01:45:25 your predictions and your beliefs why you think they make sense can you convince me what the implications are
01:45:30 you know can you so can you reason intelligently and make me believe that those the
01:45:40 implications of your prediction and so forth so what happens is it becomes reflective my standard for judging your
01:45:51 intelligence depends a lot on mine but you're saying that there should be a large group of people with a certain
01:45:57 standard of intelligence that would be convinced by this particular AI system then there should be by I think one of
01:46:08 the depending on the content one of the problems we have there is that if that large community of people are not
01:46:14 judgment judging it with regard to a rigorous standard of objective logic and reason you still have a problem like
01:46:23 masses of people can be persuaded the Millennials yeah to turn them turn their brains off
01:46:33 right okay sorry I have nothing against the warning I just so you you're a part of one of the great benchmarks
01:46:43 challenges of AI history what do you think about alpha zero open AI five alpha star accomplishments on video
01:46:53 games recently which are also I think at least in the case of go without fagala now for zero playing go was a monumental
01:47:00 accomplishment as well what are your thoughts about that challenge I think it was a giant lamare I I think it was
01:47:05 phenomenal I mean as one of those other things nobody thought like solving go was gonna be easy particularly because
01:47:10 it's again it's hard for particularly hard for humans our team is to learn how for humans to excel at and so it was up
01:47:18 another measure a measure of intelligence it's very cool I mean it's very interesting you know what they did
01:47:27 I mean and I loved how they solved like the data problem which again they bootstrapped it and got the machine to
01:47:31 play itself to generate enough data to learn from I think that was brilliant I think that was great and and and of
01:47:38 course the result speaks for itself I think it makes us think about again it is okay what's intelligence what aspects
01:47:45 of intelligence are important can the can the go machine help me make me a better go player is it an alien
01:47:52 intelligence it was is am I even capable of like again if we if we put in very simple terms it found the function we
01:47:59 found the go function can I even comprehend the go function can I talk about the go function can i
01:48:04 conceptualize the go function like whatever it might be so one of the interesting ideas of that system is it
01:48:10 plays against itself right yeah but there's no human in the loop there so like you're saying it could have by
01:48:19 itself created an alien intelligence how torta torta gorrik imagine you're sentencing you're judging you're
01:48:25 sentencing people or you're setting policy or you're you know you're making medical decisions and you can't explain
01:48:35 you can't get anybody to understand what you're doing or why so it's it's it's an interesting dilemma
01:48:44 for the applications of AI do we hold AI to this accountability that says you know humans have to be humans have to be
01:48:54 able to take responsibility you know for for the decision in other words can you explain why you would do the thing well
01:49:01 you will use get up and speak to other humans and convince them that this was a smart decision is the AI enabling you to
01:49:08 do that can you get behind the logic that was made there do you think sorry to link on this point because it's a
01:49:15 there's a fascinating one that's a great goal for AI do you think it's achievable in many cases or do you okay there's two
01:49:24 possible worlds that we have in the future one is where AI systems do like medical diagnosis or things like that
01:49:33 would drive a car without ever explaining to you why it fails when it does that's one possible world then
01:49:41 we're okay with it or the other where we are not okay with it and we really hold back the technology from getting to good
01:49:49 before it gets able to explain which of those worlds are more likely do you think and which are concerning to you or
01:49:54 not I think the reality is it's gonna be a mix you know I'm not trying a problem with that I mean I think there are tasks
01:50:02 that perfectly fine with machines show a certain level of performance and that level of performance is already better
01:50:07 it is already better than humans so for example I don't know that I get tape driverless cars if driverless cars learn
01:50:14 how to be more effective drivers than humans but can't explain what they're doing but bottom line statistically
01:50:21 speaking there you know ten times safer than humans I I don't know that I care I think when we we have these edge cases
01:50:29 when something bad happens and we want to decide who's liable for that thing and who made that mistake in what we do
01:50:34 about that and I think in those those educators are interesting cases and now do we go to designers of the AI and the
01:50:40 I says I don't know if that's what it learned to do and it says well you didn't train it properly you know you
01:50:46 you were you were negligent in the training data that you gave that machine like how do we drive down and realize oh
01:50:50 so I think those are I think those are interesting questions so the optimization problem there sorry
01:50:56 is to create a system that's able to explain the lawyers away there you go I think that   I think it's gonna be
01:51:04 interesting I mean I think this is where technology and social discourse are gonna get like deeply intertwined and
01:51:11 how we start thinking about problems decisions and problems like that I think in other cases it becomes more obvious
01:51:19 where you know it's I got like why did you decide to give that person you know a longer sentence or or to deny them
01:51:29 parole again policy decisions or why did you pick that treatment like that treatment up killing that guy like why
01:51:35 was that a reasonable choice to make so so and people are gonna demand explanations now there's a reality
01:51:44 though here and the reality is that it's not I'm not sure humans are making reasonable choices when they do these
01:51:52 things they are using statistical hunches biases or even systematically using statistical averages to make
01:52:00 Osmonds is what happened my dad if you saw that target gave about that but you know I mean they decided that my father
01:52:08 was brain dead he had went into cardiac arrest and it took a long time for the ambulance to get there and wasn't not
01:52:14 resuscitated right away and so forth and they came they told me he was brain dead and why was he brain dead because
01:52:19 essentially they gave me a purely statistical argument under these conditions with these four features 98%
01:52:26 chance he's brain dead innocent but can you just tell me not inductively but deductively go there and tell me his
01:52:31 brain stopped functioning is the way for you to do that and they and and their the the protocol in response was no this
01:52:38 is how we make this decision I said this is adequate for me I understand the statistics and I don't have you know
01:52:44 there's a two percent chance he's so like I just don't know the specifics I need the specifics of this case and I
01:52:51 want the deductive logical argument about why you actually know he's brained it so I wouldn't sign that do not
01:52:57 resuscitate and I don't know it was like they went through lots of procedures as a big long story but the bottom was a
01:53:02 fascinating story by the way but how I reasoned and how the doctors reasoned through this whole process but I don't
01:53:07 know somewhere around 24 hours later or something he was sitting up that would zero bushido brain damage any
01:53:17 what lessons do you draw from that story that experience that the data that they're you that the data that's being
01:53:23 used to make sophistical inferences doesn't adequately reflect the phenomenon so in other words you're
01:53:30 getting Ramsar you're getting stuff wrong because you're your model is not robust enough and you might be better
01:53:41 off not using statistical inference and statistical averages in certain cases when you know the models insufficient
01:53:46 and that you should be reasoning at about the specific case more logically and more deductively and hold yourself
01:53:53 responsible to hold yourself accountable to doing that and perhaps AI has a role to say the exact thing we just said
01:54:03 which is perhaps this is a case you should think for yourself you should reason deductively so it's hard it's
01:54:11 it's so it's hard because it's hard to know that you know you'd have to go back and you'd have to have enough data to
01:54:18 essentially say and this goes back to how do we this goes back to the case of how do we decide whether the AI is good
01:54:25 enough to do a particular task and regardless of whether or not it produces an explanation
01:54:32 so and and what standards do we hold right for that so you know if you look at you you look more broadly for
01:54:44 example as my father as a metal kick medical case the medical system ultimately helped him a lot throughout
01:54:53 his life without it he probably would have died much sooner so overall sort of you know work for him
01:55:01 and sort of a net in that kind of way actually I don't know that's fair but it maybe not in that particular case but
01:55:08 overall like oh the medical system overall that's more given a system overall you know was doing more more
01:55:15 good than bad now is another argument that suggests that wasn't the case but for the for the sake of argument let's
01:55:20 say like that's let's say a net positive and I think you have to sit there and there and take
01:55:25 take that into consideration now you look at a particular use case like for example making this this decision have
01:55:33 you done enough studies to know how good that prediction really is right and how you have you done enough studies to
01:55:41 compare it to say well what if we what if we dug in and in a more direct you know let's get the evidence let's let's
01:55:48 do the deductive thing and not use the statistics here how often would that have done better right you just so you
01:55:54 have to do this studies to know how good the AI actually is and it's complicated because depends how fast you have to
01:56:00 make decision so if you have to make the decision superfast do you have no choice right if you have more time right but if
01:56:09 you're ready to pull the plug and this is a lot of the argument that I had was a doctor I said what's he gonna do if
01:56:14 you do it what's gonna happen to him in that room if you do it my way you know if you do well he's gonna die anyway so
01:56:21 let's do it my way though I mean it raises questions for our society to struggle with as was the case with your
01:56:28 father but also when things like race and gender start coming into play when when certain when when judgments are
01:56:37 made made based on things that are complicated in our society at least in this course and it starts you know I
01:56:44 think I think I'm safe to say that most of the violent crimes committed by males so if you discriminate based you know as
01:56:54 a male versus female saying that if it's a male more likely to commit the crime so this is one of my my very positive
01:57:02 and optimistic view views of why the study of artificial intelligence the process of thinking and reasoning
01:57:10 logically and statistically and how to combine them is so important for the discourse today because it's causing a
01:57:16 regardless of what what state AI device devices are or not it's causing this dialogue to happen
01:57:23 this is one of the most important dialogues that in my view the human species can have right now which is how
01:57:33 to think well yeah how to reason well how to understand our own cognitive biases and what to do about them that
01:57:43 has got to be one of the most important things we as as as a species can be doing honestly we are reached we've
01:57:50 created an incredibly complex society we've created amazing abilities to amplify noise faster than we can play
01:58:00 amplifies signal we are challenged we are deeply deeply challenged we have you know big segments of the population
01:58:07 getting hit with enormous amounts of information do they know how to do critical thinking do they know how to
01:58:14 objectively objectively reason do they understand what they are doing nevermind with their AI is doing this is such an
01:58:22 important dialogue you know to be having and and and you know we are fundamentally are thinking can be and
01:58:30 easily becomes fundamentally bias and there are statistics and we shouldn't blind our so we shouldn't discard
01:58:37 statistical inference but we should understand the nature of such this conference as us as a society as you
01:58:47 know we decided to reject statistical inference to favor individual understanding and and deciding on the
01:58:59 individual yes we we consciously make that choice so even if the statistics said even if the Cystic said males are
01:59:08 more likely to have you know to be violent criminals we still take each person as an individual and we treat
01:59:16 them based on the logic and the knowledge of that situation we purposefully and intentionally reject
01:59:26 the statistical once we do that at a respect for the individual for the individual yeah and
01:59:33 then that requires reasoning and cracking looking forward what Grand Challenges would you like to see in the
01:59:41 future because the the Jeopardy challenge you know captivated the world alpha go alpha zero cap day of the world
01:59:50 deep blue certainly beating Kasparov Gary's bitterness aside and captivated the world what do you think do you have
01:59:59 ideas for next grand challenges for future challenges of that oh you know I look I mean I think there are lots of
02:00:04 really great ideas for Grand Challenges I'm particularly focused on one right now which is Kent you know can you
02:00:12 demonstrate that they understand that they could read and understand that they can they can acquire these frameworks
02:00:19 and communicate you know reason and communicate with humans so it is kind of like the Turing test but it's a little
02:00:26 bit more demanding than the Turing test it's not enough it's not enough to convince me that you might be human
02:00:32 because you could you know you can parrot a conversation I think you know the the this standard is a little bit
02:00:42 higher is for example can you you know the santa is higher and I think one of the challenges of devising this grand
02:00:52 challenge is that we're not sure what intelligence is we're not sure how to determine whether or not two people
02:00:59 actually understand each other and then what depth they understand it they you know and what to what depth they
02:01:05 understand each other so the challenge becomes something along the lines of can you satisfy me that we have a shared
02:01:16 understanding so if I were to probe and probe and you probe me can can can can machines really act like thought
02:01:25 partners where they could satisfy me that they that we have a share our understanding is shared enough that we
02:01:32 can collaborate and produce the answers together and that you know they they can help me explain and justify those
02:01:39 answers so maybe here's an idea so we'll have a Isis run for president and convinced that's
02:01:45 too easy from sorry oh no you have to convince the voters that they should vote for it
02:01:54 so they s what I would again again I that's why I think this is such a challenge because we go back to the
02:02:01 emotional persuasion we go back to you know now we're checking off an aspect of human cognition that is in many ways
02:02:12 weak or flawed right we're so easily manipulated our minds are drawn for often the wrong reasons right not the
02:02:21 reasons that ultimately matter to us but the reasons that can easily persuade us I think we can be persuaded to believe
02:02:28 one thing or another for reasons that ultimately don't serve us well in the long term and a good
02:02:37 benchmark should not play with those elements of emotional manipulation I don't think so I think that's where we
02:02:44 have to set the set the higher standard for ourselves of what you know what does it mean this goes back to rationality
02:02:50 and it goes back to objective thinking and can you produce can you acquire information and produce reasoned
02:02:56 arguments and to those reasons arguments pass a certain amount of muster and is it and can you acquire new knowledge you
02:03:05 know can you can you under can you reason oh I have acquired new knowledge can you identify where it's consistent
02:03:11 or contradictory with other things you've learned and can you explain that to me and get me to understand that so I
02:03:17 think another way to think about it perhaps is kind of machine teach you can the hell
02:03:29 really nice less than that's where to put it can you understand something that you didn't really understand before
02:03:37 where's where is you know it's taking it so you're not you know again it's almost like can it can it teach you can it help
02:03:46 you learn and and in an arbitrary space so it can open those domain space so can you tell the Machine and again this
02:03:52 borrows from some science fiction's abut can you go off and learn about this topic that I'd like to understand better
02:03:59 and then work with me to help me understand it that's quite brilliant what the machine that passes that kind
02:04:08 of test do you think it would need to have self-awareness or even consciousness what do you think about
02:04:17 consciousness and the importance of it maybe in relation to having a body having a presence an entity do you think
02:04:27 that's important you know people used to ask if Watson was conscious and I used to think and he said he's the conscious
02:04:33 of what exactly I mean I think you know main cell it depends what it is that you're conscious I mean like so you know
02:04:40 did it if you you know it's certainly easy for it to answer questions about it would be trivial to program it so the
02:04:46 answer questions about whether or not it was playing jeopardy I mean it could certainly answer questions that will
02:04:50 imply that it was aware of things exactly what does it mean to be aware and what does it mean to conscious and
02:04:54 it's sort of interesting I mean I think that we differ from one another based on what we're conscious of but wait wait
02:05:03 for sure there's degrees of consciousness in there so it well in those areas like it's not just agrees
02:05:09 what do you what do you what are you aware of like what are you not aware but nevertheless there's a very subjective
02:05:16 element to our experience let me even not talk about consciousness let me talk about another to me really interesting
02:05:25 topic immortality fear or mortality Watson as far as I could tell did not have a fear of death certainly not most
02:05:38 most humans do wasn't conscious of death it wasn't that so there's an element of finiteness to our existence that I think
02:05:47 like we like I mentioned survival that adds to the whole thing that I mean consciousness is tied up with that that
02:05:54 we are us thing it's a subjective thing that ends and that seems to add a color and flavor to our motivations in a way
02:06:03 that seems to be fundamentally important for intelligence or at least the kind of human intelligence well I take for
02:06:10 generating goals again I think you could have you could have an intelligence capability and a capability to learn I
02:06:19 capability to predict but I think without I mean again you get a fear but essentially without the goal to survive
02:06:28 so you think you can just encode that without having to million code I mean can you create a robot now and you could
02:06:36 say you know and plug it in and say protect your power source you know and give it some capabilities and we'll sit
02:06:41 there and operate to try to protect this power source and survive I mean I so I don't know that that's false awfully a
02:06:47 hard thing to demonstrate it sounds like a fairly easy thing to demonstrate that you can give it that goal we'll come up
02:06:52 with that goal by itself as you have to program that goal in but there's something because I think as we touched
02:07:00 on intelligence is kind of like a social construct the the fact that a robot will be protecting its power source
02:07:11 would would add depth and grounding to its intelligence in terms of us being able to respect I mean ultimately it
02:07:19 boils down to us acknowledging that it's intelligent and the fact that it can die I think is an important part of that the
02:07:28 interesting thing to reflect on is how trivial that would be and and I don't think if you knew how trivial that was
02:07:33 you would associate that with being intelligence I mean I literally put in a statement of code that says you know you
02:07:40 have the following actions you can take you give it a bunch of actions like you mount a laser gun on her or you may do
02:07:48 you the ability to scream a screech or whatever and you know and you you say you know if you see your power source
02:07:55 then you could program that in and you know you're gonna print it you're gonna take these actions to protect it you
02:08:01 know you teach it checking it on a bunch of things so and and now you're gonna look at that and you say well you know
02:08:05 that's intelligence because it's protecting power source maybe but that's again at this human bias that says the
02:08:12 thing I had then I identify my intelligence and my conscious so fundamentally with the desire or at
02:08:18 least the behaviors associated with the desire to survive that if I see another thing doing that I'm going to assume
02:08:26 it's intelligent what timeline year will society have a something that would that you would be
02:08:36 comfortable calling an artificial general intelligence system well what's your intuition nobody can predict the future
02:08:45 certainly not next few months or twenty years away but what's your intuition how far away are we
02:08:51 I the ideas hearts make these predictions and I would be you know I would be guessing and there's so many
02:08:57 different variables including just how much we want to invest in it and how important it you know and how important
02:09:02 we think it is what kind of investment are willing to make in it what kind of talent we end up
02:09:08 bringing to the table all you know the incentive structure all these things so I think it is possible to do this sort
02:09:18 of thing I think it's I think trying to sort of ignore many of the variables and things like that
02:09:25 is it a ten-year thing as a 23 it's probably closer to a 20-year thing I guess but not as little no I don't think
02:09:32 it's several hundred years I don't think it's several hundred years but again so much depends on how committed we are to
02:09:40 investing and incentivizing this type of work this type of work and it's sort of interesting like I don't think it's obvious
02:09:50 how incentivize we are I think from a task perspective you know if we see business opportunities to take this
02:09:58 technique is a technique to solve that problem I think that's the main driver for many from any of these things from a
02:10:05 from a general Tosta seems kind of an interesting question are we really motivated to do that and and like we
02:10:12 just struggled ourselves right now to even define what it is so it's hard to incentivize when we don't even know what
02:10:18 it is we're incentivized to create and if you said mimic a human intelligence I just think there are so many
02:10:26 challenges with the the significance and meaning of that there's not a clear directive there's no clear directive to
02:10:33 do precisely that thing so assistance in a larger and larger number of tasks so being able to a system that's
02:10:40 particularly able to operate my microwave and making a grilled cheese sandwich I don't even know how to make
02:10:46 one of those and then the same system would be doing the vacuum cleaning and then the same system would be teaching
02:10:56 my kids that I don't have math I think that when when when you get into a general intelligence for learning
02:11:05 physical tasks and again yeah I want to go back to your body questions it's on your body question was interesting but
02:11:10 you want to go back to you know learning abilities do physical tasks you might have we might get Majan in that
02:11:17 timeframe we will get better and better at learning these kinds of tasks whether it's mowing your lawn or driving a car
02:11:23 or whatever it is I think we will get better and better at that where it's learning how to make predictions over
02:11:27 large bodies of data as if we're going to continue to get better and better at that and machines will out you know
02:11:34 outpace humans and and a variety of those things the underlying mechanisms for doing that may be the same meaning
02:11:42 that you know maybe these are deep Nats there's infrastructure to train them reusable components to get them to
02:11:51 different classes of tasks and we get better and better at building these kinds of machines you could see argue
02:11:56 that the general learning infrastructure in there is a form of a general type of intelligence I think what starts getting
02:12:06 harder is this notion of you know can we can we effectively communicate and understand and build that shared
02:12:11 understanding because of the layers of interpretation that are required to do that and the need for the machine to be
02:12:18 engaged with humans at that level at a continuous basis so how do you get in how do you get the machine in the game
02:12:24 how do you get the machine in the intellectual game yeah and to solve AGI you probably have to solve that problem
02:12:32 you have to get the machine so it's a little bit of a bootstrapping can we get the machine engaged and
02:12:38 you know in the intellectual calling a game but in the intellectual dialogue with the humans are the humans
02:12:44 sufficiently an intellectual dialogue with each other to generate enough to generate enough data in this context and
02:12:52 how do you bootstrap that because every one of those conversations every one of those conversations those intelligent
02:12:59 interactions require so much prior knowledge that is a challenge to bootstrap it so that's so as so the
02:13:06 question is and how committed so I think that's possible but when I go back to are we incentivized to do that I know
02:13:13 we're incentivized to do the former are we incentivize to do the latter significantly enough to people
02:13:17 understand what the latter really is well enough part of the elemental cognition mission is to try to
02:13:23 articulate that better and better you know through demonstrations and to trying to craft these grand challenges
02:13:28 and get people to say look this is a class of intelligence this is a class of AI do we do we want this what what is
02:13:36 the potential of this what are the business what's the business potential what's the societal potential to that
02:13:41 and so you know and to build up that incentive system around that yeah I think if people don't understand yet I
02:13:48 think they will and is a huge business potential here so it's exciting that you're working on it you've kind of
02:13:56 skipped over but I'm a huge fan of physical presence of things do you think you know Watson head of body do you
02:14:08 think having a body as to the interactive element between the AI system and a human or just in general to
02:14:16 intelligence so I think I think going back to that shared understanding bit humans are very connected to their
02:14:23 bodies I mean is one of the reasons one of the challenges in getting an AI to kind of be a compatible human
02:14:31 intelligence is that our physical bodies are generating a lot of features that make up the input so in other words
02:14:40 where our bodies are are the the tool we use to affect output but they're also but they also generate a lot of input
02:14:48 for our brains so we generate emotion we generate all these feelings we generate all these signals that machines
02:14:53 don't have so missions that have this as the input data and they don't have the the feedback that says okay I've gotten
02:15:01 this I've gotten this emotion or I've gotten this idea I now want to process that and then I can it then affects me
02:15:09 as a physical being and then I and I and I can play that out in other words I could realize the implications of tax
02:15:16 implications again on my bond mind body complex I then process that and the implications again are internal features
02:15:23 are generated I learned from them they have an effect on my mind body complex so it's interesting when we think do we
02:15:31 want a human intelligence well if we want a human compatible intelligence probably the best thing to do is to
02:15:36 embed it embedded in a human body just to clarify and both concepts beautiful is humanoid robots so robots
02:15:46 that look like humans is one or did you mean actually sort of what Hamas was working with neural link really
02:15:56 embedding intelligence systems that the ride-alongs human bodies know I was riding along is different I meant like
02:16:05 if you want to create an intelligence that is human compatible meaning that it can learn and develop a shared
02:16:13 understanding of the world around it you have to give it a lot of the same substrate part of that substrate you
02:16:19 know is the idea that it generates these kinds of internal features like sort of emotional stuff it has similar senses it
02:16:25 has to do a lot of the same things with those same sentences right so I think if you want that again I don't know that
02:16:32 you want that like man like that's not my specific goal I think that's a fascinating scientific goal I think it
02:16:37 has all kinds of other implications that's sort of not to go like I want it I want to create I think of it as I
02:16:43 create intellectual thought martyrs for humans so that kind of that kind of intelligence I know other companies that are creating
02:16:50 physical thought partners the fiscal partners to figure out for you but that's kind of not where we're you know
02:16:58 I'm at but but but the the important point is that a big part of how of what we process is that physical experience
02:17:08 of the world around us on the point of thought partners what role does an emotional connection
02:17:18 or forgive me love have to play in that thought partnership is that something you're interested in put another way
02:17:27 sort of having a deep connection beyond intellectual with the AI yeah with the a between human and ass
02:17:33 is that something that gets in the way of the the rational discourse is there something that's useful I worry about
02:17:42 biases you know obviously so in other words if you develop an emotional relationship with the machines do all of
02:17:47 a sudden you start are more likely to believe what it's saying even if it doesn't make any sense
02:17:53 so I you know I worry about that but at the same time I think the opportunity to use machines to provide human
02:17:59 companionship is actually not crazy and it's again the intellectual and social companionship is not crazy the idea do
02:18:10 you have concerns as a few people do you know Musk Sam Harris about long-term existential threats of AI and perhaps
02:18:19 short-term threats of AI we talked about bias we talked about different misuses but do you have concerns about thought
02:18:27 partners systems that are able to help us make decisions together humans somehow having a significant negative
02:18:33 impact on society in the long term I think there aren't things to worry about I think the giving machines too much
02:18:42 leverage is a problem and what I mean by leverage is is too much control for things that can hurt us whether it's
02:18:50 socially psychological intellectually or physically and if you give them machines too much control I think that's a
02:18:56 concern you forget about the AI just when you give them too much control human bad actors can hack them and
02:19:06 produce havoc so you know that's a problem and you imagine hackers taking over the driverless car Network and you
02:19:15 know creating all kinds of havoc but you could also imagine given given the ease at which humans could be persuaded one
02:19:23 way or the other and now we have algorithms that can easily take control over over that over that and amplify
02:19:31 noise and move people one direction or another I mean humans do that to other humans all the time and we have
02:19:35 marketing campaigns we have political campaigns that take it to image of our our emotions or our fears and this is
02:19:45 done all the time when but with machines machines are like giant mecha phones right we can amplify this and orders of
02:19:52 magnitude and can fine-tune its control so we can tailor the message we can now very rapidly and efficiently tailor the
02:20:01 message to the audience taking taking advantage of you know of their biases and amplifying them and using them to
02:20:07 pursue a them in one direction or another in ways that are not fair not logical not objective not meaningful and
02:20:17 humans the machines and power that so so that's what I mean by leverage like it's not new but wow it's powerful because
02:20:24 machines can do it more effectively more more you know more quickly and we see that already going on and and and social
02:20:30 media not the plays and other places that's scary and and that's why like I'm I'm that's why I go back to saying one
02:20:43 of the most important public dialogues we could be having is about the nature of intelligence and the nature of
02:20:52 inference and logic and reason and rationality and us understanding our own biases us understanding our own
02:21:00 cognitive biases and how they work and then how machines work and how do we use them to complement and sit basically so
02:21:08 that in the end we have a stronger overall system that's just incredibly important I don't
02:21:16 most people understand that so so like telling telling your kids or telling your students this goes back to the
02:21:23 cognition here's how your brain works here's how easy it is to trick your brain right there are fundamental
02:21:31 cognitive but you should appreciate the different the different types of thinking and how they work and what
02:21:38 you're prone to and you know and what and what do you prefer and under what conditions does this make
02:21:43 sense versus that makes sense and then say here's what AI can do here's how it can make this worse and here's how it
02:21:51 can make this better and then that's where the as a role is to reveal that then the that trade-off so if you
02:22:02 imagine a system that is able to beyond any definition of the Turing test of the benchmark really an AGI system as a
02:22:12 thought partner that you one day will create what question what topic of discussion if you get to pick one would
02:22:24 you have with that system what would you ask and you get to find out the truth together so you threw me a little bit
02:22:38 with finding the truth at the end but this is a whole nother topic but the I think the beauty of it I think what
02:22:46 excites me is the beauty of it is if I really have that system I don't have to pick so in other words I can you know I
02:22:52 can go to and say this is where I care about today and and and that's what we mean by like this general capability go
02:22:59 out read this stuff in the next three milliseconds and I want to talk to you about it I want to draw analogies I want
02:23:06 to understand how this affects this decision or that decision what if this were true what if that were true what
02:23:13 what knowledge should I be aware of that could impact my decision here's what I'm thinking is the main
02:23:20 implication can you find can you prove that out can you give me the evidence that supports that can you give me
02:23:25 evidence supports this oh there's a boy that would that be incredible you would that be just incredible just a
02:23:31 long discourse just to be part of whether it's a medical diagnosis or whether it's you know the various
02:23:36 treatment options or whether it's a legal case or whether it's a social problem that people are discussing like
02:23:46 be part of the dialogue one that holds itself and us accountable to reasons an objective dialogue you know I just I get
02:23:57 goosebumps talking about it right so when when you create it please come back on the podcast well the discussion
02:24:05 together and make it even longer this is a record for the longest conversation now there's an honor it was a pleasure
