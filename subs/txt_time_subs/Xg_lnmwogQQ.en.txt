00:00:07 what kind of gear do I use so I'm in Columbia right now shooting borders the question I get asked most is what gear I
00:00:15 use this bag carries all my gear it is a peak design bag discovered it about two years ago and it's changed my
00:00:25 world I'm not gonna go into the bag specifically the everyday bag it's the 30 leader and I love it this is a water
00:00:33 bottle made by swell that I use because it slips perfectly into the side of this peak design bag love that let's see the
00:00:45 main stuff I use of course this guy this is a drone and it is been a BEC pro there are new Maddox that are beautiful
00:00:55 and better than this but I stick with this just because I know it and it's I don't want to upgrade yet and we have a
00:01:01 couple of these as backup and the batteries all changed together so we're just gonna stick with the Mavic for a
00:01:07 little bit both is and I both use this and I love it and it's beautiful and it's tiny
00:01:13 just like fits right into the bag in terms of a camera I'm filming with a camera right now obviously so I'm not
00:01:19 gonna show you it although I do have a backup so this is the a7s2 this is what I've always shot on I'm
00:01:28 actually right now this camera shooting on the a7 3 if you don't know the difference between a 7 our a7 s and a 7
00:01:36 you can go like look into that they're all slightly different versions of this same series the Alpha series a7 series
00:01:46 and I shoot currently on the a7 3 which is the camera shooting on now it's almost identical to this camera the a7s2
00:01:53 but slightly different it's tiny look it looks like a point-and-shoot love this thing and will continue to
00:01:58 shoot on it into the future unless there's a camera that's this tiny that comes out in terms of lenses I shoot I
00:02:09 use this mainly 24 to 70 unfortunately I dropped this and if that happened but it still shoots fine
00:02:17 turns out the camera doesn't even go through all of this part of the lens it's only the interim until the lens
00:02:23 that it actually goes through so I'm actually shooting on this lens and it works perfectly
00:02:34 which is amazing 24 to 70 GM f 2.8 Sony lens and this is Izzie's it is a 85 1.8 prime lens that is beautiful and amazing
00:02:44 and she let me borrow it for this trip I'm in Columbia right now I keep all my batteries in a little pouch like this
00:02:51 lavalier this little guy it is a Sennheiser it has a little receiver that goes right into the thing that is on my
00:03:00 camera right now it's called the k2 M it's a little unit that goes right on the top of the camera and it turns it
00:03:09 into an XLR input so now I can shoot XLR and I can put a shotgun mic and this in there and have two beautiful signals of
00:03:18 audio very wonderful I've always used this for my vlogging for borders it is an amazing little thing it's called and
00:03:30 Osmo and it just is so stable it's so small but here's the problem it has really really unreliable audio and
00:03:41 really really unreliable picture 85% of the time you're gonna get beautiful audio beautiful picture but 15% of the
00:03:46 time you're gonna get really weird artifacts in the picture and in the audio signal and to the form of like
00:03:54 furniture and Terrier design that I just can't do that anymore I've been doing it for years and I hate it now I just can't
00:04:00 do it so I decided to give up on this thing which is painful because I love it it's so simple and small and beautiful
00:04:09 there's a hint handheld gimbal that is fantastic for stabilizer shots I'm using it for the first time on this trip to
00:04:15 Colombia I've liked it so far it's really nice it's basically replaced my knee for a tripod in most settings it's
00:04:21 heavy in the sense that you have to look carry the thing around as a backup audio thing I use this road mic again this is
00:04:30 Izzie's I'm using it this road mic rode videomic is great and they use it for like vlog stuff just like running gun
00:04:39 although the k2m is I'm slowly moving over for charging batteries I put all of my Chargers into this Tupperware and I
00:04:54 velcro down this power strip and then I just take out like my drone charger or like my phone charger like all these
00:05:00 charges are in here and they and they all they all like wrap up into this thing and all I have to do is plug in
00:05:06 one thing and then there it they're all power so that's beautiful and nice and it just it closes as a tapas obviously I'm not
00:05:13 don't have that all organized or no because I'm charging all right I'm losing light so I should burn through
00:05:19 this little quicker I used these head these are my lifesaver I fly so much and these things change everything they're
00:05:25 just they're noise cancelling headphones made by Bose or the QC 35 and I used them so much to listen to books to
00:05:35 listen to music for overnight flights I have this sleep playlist that I listen to that like puts me asleep man
00:05:41 overnight flight so literally the worst thing that ever have been invented but that is my life so here we go okay my
00:05:59 2017 MacBook Pro and it is works great I use Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects I use chrono sync which is a way
00:06:10 to backup your footage onto hard drives speaking of hard drives I have I also wear these when I don't want to cancel
00:06:20 noise I'll just put on headphone little air pods this is speaking of hard drives a little tiny Samsung hard drive that is
00:06:31 a solid-state one terabyte drive it's tiny and this is my principal drive that I work off of it's small my problem with
00:06:37 drives is that always like on an airplane around like a bus or in a jeep like working and the
00:06:43 drive will disconnect like well I'm in the middle of editing which is the worst thing in the world and so this thing is
00:06:50 so nimble and tiny and not heavy that it doesn't disconnect it kind of just flops around and it's great with that I also
00:06:59 buy these really long cables so that I can like connect it and like put it in some safe place and be like working and
00:07:04 just have to worry about the cable because the MacBook requires dongles I had this little toiletry bag that
00:07:12 carries all of my dongles and all of my little cables my phone chargers things like that okay
00:07:20 tripod tripod I'm using is this Manfrotto be free tripod it is very small what I like about this tripod is
00:07:30 that I can break it down I'll do this really quick what I like about this tripod is it now fits in the water
00:07:38 bottle holder in the side of my peak design bag which is again
00:07:45 heaven like I hate my life when gear is in the way of doing stuff so I could upgrade to a bunch of really nice stuff
00:07:52 and get probably better picture and better quality but if it inhibits me from doing the kind of nimble work that
00:08:00 I like to do then it is definitely not worth it I store everything into canals way too dark for me to even show this
00:08:07 just know that this is a Manfrotto carry-on bag that's like fortified it's kind of like a pelican case but it's
00:08:13 just a good carry-on bag I'm able to put all of my gear and my clothing everything into this peak design bag in
00:08:19 that carry-on bag and I don't so I don't have to check bags which is really really really nice again when you can
00:08:26 just streamline your life with smaller simpler stuff then you can do the fun stuff which is like going places did I
00:08:36 leave anything out I use an iPhone 10 iPhone 10 which is I don't know I don't love it it's not like I don't love it I
00:08:46 think the camera is nice but I don't I don't think it's special I got it because I thought it was gonna be
00:08:50 special and I was kind like underwhelmed by it but it no it works it's good and that is all of my
00:08:59 gear oh yeah I put this little filter this is a nd a graduated ND filter that can go from two to eight stops for
00:09:08 shooting in kind of brighter conditions I put that on both the lenses not all the time but when it's bright outside
00:09:18 I'll try to put it on at the end of the day gear matters it does matter for getting quality stuff it doesn't matter
00:09:27 in the sense that it's not going to make your stuff amazing unfortunately my issue is that people I feel like because
00:09:34 gear is easy to quantify you can like read the numbers and say oh it has this many megapixels and it has it shoots
00:09:40 this frame rate at 4k it's a lot easier to get into that it's not as as kind of subjective as story and as doing kind of
00:09:50 the work and so I think a lot of people get fixated on gear because it's easier frankly I know I do that often like I
00:09:56 should upgrade to this camera because it's so much easier to like feel like you're getting better by buying
00:10:01 something that has really cool specs than it is to say like oh what weird new technique should I try to make my story
00:10:08 better or like my presentation better so anyway that's my theory on gear that's what I use if you have any questions
00:10:14 please leave them here I'd love to answer them the best I can and I hope this was
