00:00:02 as part of MIT course success zero nine nine on artificial general intelligence I got a chance to sit down with
00:00:06 Christophe Coe who's one of the seminal figures in neurobiology in neuroscience and
00:00:14 generally in the study of consciousness he is the president the chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute for brain
00:00:25 science in Seattle from 1986 to 2013 he was the professor at Caltech before that he was at MIT he is extremely well sited
00:00:33 over a hundred thousand citations his research his writing his ideas have had big impact on the scientific community
00:00:40 and the general public in the way we think about consciousness in the way we see ourselves as human beings he's the
00:00:46 author of several books the quest for consciousness and your biological approach and a more recent book
00:00:53 consciousness confessions of a romantic reductionist if you enjoy this conversation this course subscribe click
00:01:00 the little bell I got to make sure you never miss a video and in the comments leave suggestions for any people you'd
00:01:07 like to see be part of the course or any ideas that you would like us to explore thanks very much I hope you enjoy okay
00:01:14 before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness let's zoom out a little bit and let me ask do you
00:01:22 think there's intelligent life out there in the universe yes I do believe so we have no evidence of it but I think the
00:01:29 probabilities are overwhelming in favor of it give me a universe where we have 10 to
00:01:34 the 11 galaxies and each galaxy is between 10 to the 11 10 to the 12 stars and we know more stars have one or more
00:01:42 planets so how does that make you feel it still makes me feel special because I have experiences I feel the world I
00:01:53 experience the world and independent of whether there are other creatures out there I still feel the world and I have
00:01:59 access to this world in this very strange compelling way and that's the core of human existence now he said
00:02:09 human do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there do you think they experience
00:02:15 their world yes they evolved if they are product of natural evolution if it would have to be they will also experience
00:02:20 their own world so consciousness isn't just a human your ID it's it's much wider it's probably it may be spread
00:02:28 across all of biology we have the only thing that we have special is we can talk about it of course not all people
00:02:33 can talk about the babies and little children can talk about the patients who have have a Stoke and let's see the left
00:02:40 inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it but most normal adult people can talk about it and so we think that makes us
00:02:46 special compared to little monkeys a dogs or cats or mice or all the other creatures that we share the planet with
00:02:51 but all the evidence seems to suggest that they to experience the world and so it's overwhelmingly likely that other
00:02:58 alien that aliens would also experience their world of course differently because they have a difference in serum
00:03:03 they've different sense of they had a very different environment but the fact that I would strongly suppose that they
00:03:11 also have experiences if your pain and pleasure and see in some sort of spectrum and here and have all the other
00:03:18 sensors of course their language if they have one would be different so we might not be able to understand their poetry
00:03:24 about the experiences that they have that's correct right so in a talk in a video I've heard you mention support so
00:03:33 a DAC sound that you came up with there you go up with as part of your family when you were young first of all
00:03:40 you're a technically a Midwestern boy you just secondly yes after that you traveled around a bit and it's a little
00:03:48 bit of the accent you talked about support so the DAC solid having these elements of humaneness of consciousness
00:03:57 that he discovered so I just wanted to ask can you look back and you childhood and remember one was the first time you
00:04:04 realized you yourself sort of from a third-person perspective or our conscious being this idea of you know
00:04:13 stepping outside yourself and seeing well there's something special going on here in my brain I can't really actually
00:04:20 it's a good question I'm not sure I recall a discrete moment I mean you take it for granted because that's the only
00:04:25 world you know at the only world I know you know it's a world of seeing and hearing voices and
00:04:33 touching and all the other things so it's only much later at early in my undergrad days when I became when I
00:04:40 enrolled in physics and in philosophy that I really thought about it and thought well this is really
00:04:44 fundamentally very very mysterious and there's nothing really in physics right now that explains his transition from
00:04:51 the physics of the brain to feelings where do the feelings come in all right so you can look at the foundational
00:04:56 equation of quantum mechanics general relativity you can look at the period table of the elements you can look at
00:05:03 the endless 80g seat chat and our genes and no way is consciousness yet I wake up every morning to a world where I have
00:05:11 experiences and so that's the hub of the ancient mind-body problem how do experiences get into the world so what
00:05:19 is consciousness experience consciousness is any any conte any experience some people call it
00:05:27 subjective feeling some people call it phenomenon phenomenology some people call it quality of their philosophy all
00:05:33 denote the same thing it feels like something in the famous word of as if a loss at Thomas Nagel it feels like
00:05:40 something to be a bad or to be a you know an American out to be angry or to be sad or to be in love or to have pain
00:05:51 and that is what experience is any possible experience could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair could be as
00:05:58 exalted as you know having a mystical moment you know in in deep meditation those are just different forms of
00:06:06 experiences experience so if you were to sit down with maybe the next skip a couple generations of IBM Watson
00:06:12 something that one jeopardy what is the gap I guess the question is between Watson that might be much more
00:06:21 smarter than you then ask then all any human alive but may not have experience what is the gap well so that's a big big
00:06:31 question that's occupied people for the last certainly last 50 years since we you know since he happened the birth of
00:06:39 of computers that's a question on chilling try to answer and of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing
00:06:46 its test and operational test so but that's not really that's you know he tried to get it what does it mean for
00:06:52 person to think and then he had this test like you lock him away and then you have a communication with him and then
00:06:57 you try to to guess after while whether that is a person or whether it's a computer system there's no question that
00:07:02 now or very soon you know Alexa or Siri or you know Google now will pass this test right and
00:07:09 you can game it but you know ultimately certainly in your generation there will be machines that will speak
00:07:15 with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said they'll remember every email you ever had like
00:07:21 like Samantha remember in the movie her yeah it's no question it's gonna happen but of course the key questions is does
00:07:27 it feel like anything to be Samantha in a movie home too does it feel like anything to be Watson and there one has
00:07:36 to be very very strongly think they're two different concepts here that we call mingle there is the concept of
00:07:42 intelligence natural or artificial and there is a concept of consciousness of experience natural or artificial those
00:07:49 are very very different things now historically we associate consciousness with intelligence why because we live in
00:07:55 a world leaving aside computers of natural selection where we are surrounded by
00:08:01 creatures either our own kin that are less or more intelligent or we go across species some some are more adapted to
00:08:08 particular environment others are less a tablet whether it's a whale or dog or you go talk about a Paramecium or a
00:08:15 little worm alright and and we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to two specialized cells
00:08:22 to a worm that has three net that has 30% of its cells and nerve cells to creature like also like a blue whale
00:08:29 that ever has had a billion even more nerve cells and so they based on behavioral evidence and based on the
00:08:35 underlying neuroscience we believe that as these creatures become more complex they are better adapted to it to their
00:08:42 particular ecological niche and they become more conscious probably because their brain calls and we believe
00:08:48 consciousness unlike the ancient ancient people thought most almost every cult thought that consciousness with
00:08:54 intelligence has to do with your heart mm-hmm and you still to see that today you see honey I love you is on my house
00:09:01 yes but what you should actually say no honey I love you was all my lateral hypothalamus and for Valentine's Day you
00:09:07 should give you a sweetheart you know hypothalamic same piece of chocolate another heart shaped chocolate
00:09:12 right and you know so we still have this language but now we believe it's a brain and so we see brains of different
00:09:17 complexity and we think well they have different levels of consciousness they're capable of different experiences
00:09:27 but now we confront a world where we know where we're beginning to engineer intelligence and it's radical unclear
00:09:35 whether the intelligence we're engineering has anything to do with consciousness and whether it can
00:09:40 experience anything because fundamentally what's the difference intelligence is about function
00:09:45 intelligence no matter exactly how you define it sort of an adaptation to new environments being able to learn and
00:09:51 quickly understand you know you know the setup of this and what's going on and who the actors and what's gonna happen next
00:09:58 gets all about function consciousness is not about function consciousness is about being it's in some sense much
00:10:06 fundamental you can see folks that you can see this in two in several cases you can see it for instance in the case of
00:10:12 the clinic when you're dealing with patients who are let's say had a stroke or had were in traffic accident etc
00:10:20 they're pretty much in mobile Terri Schiavo you may have heard historically she was a person here in the in the 90s
00:10:27 in flora - heart Stood Still she was reanimated and for the next fourteen years she was what's called in a
00:10:32 vegetative state so there are thousands of people in a vegetative state so they're you know they're you know
00:10:37 they're like this occasionally they open their eyes for two three four five six eight hours and then close their eyes
00:10:43 they have sleep-wake cycle occasionally they have behavior they do you know there but there's no way that you can
00:10:50 establish a lawful relationship between what you see or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does
00:10:58 correctly so so the so the there isn't any behavior yet in some of these people there is still experience you can you can
00:11:05 design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see there's they still explain something and of
00:11:11 course at these cases of locked-in state there's a famous book called that the diving bell and the butterfly well yet
00:11:17 an editor French editor here the stroke in the in the brainstem unable to move except his vertical eyes eye movement he
00:11:25 could just move his the eyes up and down and he dictated an entire book and some people even lose this at the end it all
00:11:32 the evidence seems to suggest that they're still in there in this case you have no behavior your consciousness
00:11:39 second cases tonight like all of us you're gonna go to sleep close your eyes you go to sleep you will wake up inside
00:11:45 your sleeping body and you will have conscious experiences they are different from everyday experience you might fly
00:11:52 you might not be surprised that you're flying you might meet a long-dead pet childhood dog and you're not surprised
00:11:58 that you're meeting them you know but you have conscious experience of love of hate you know they can be very emotional
00:12:04 your body during this stage typically to them state sends an active signal to your motor neurons to paralyze you it's
00:12:12 called atonia right because if you don't have that like some patience what do you do you act out your dreams you get
00:12:17 proximal and behavioral disorder which is a bad which is bad juju to get okay third case is pure experience so I
00:12:25 recently had this what some people call a mystical experience I went to Singapore and went into a flotation tank
00:12:33 yeah alright so this is a big tub filled was ever with water that's a body temperature and Epsom salt you still
00:12:39 completely naked you lie inside of it you close the layer Ignace complete darkness soundproof so very quickly you
00:12:47 become body less because you're floating and you're naked you have no rings no watch no nothing you don't feel your
00:12:54 body anymore it's no sound soundless there's no surf if a photon a sightless timeless because after while early on
00:13:02 you actually hear your heart but then that you you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time ceases
00:13:09 yeah and if you train yourself like in a meditation not to swing early on you think aloud you it's a little bit spooky
00:13:15 you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think well I'm gonna get bored but which I do not to think actively you
00:13:21 become mindless so there you are body less timeless you know sound less sightless mindless but you're in a
00:13:28 conscious experience you're not asleep you're not asleep you're you you are being of pure your pure being there
00:13:35 isn't any function you aren't doing any computation you're not remembering you're not projecting you're not
00:13:40 planning yet you're fully conscious you're fully conscious there's something going out there it could be just a side
00:13:46 effect so what is the the you mean epiphenomenon so what is the salaat effect meaning why what what what what
00:13:55 is the function of you being able to lay in this sense sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience
00:14:03 additionally myself obviously we didn't evolve with flotation tanks in our in our environment I mean so biology is not
00:14:10 totally bad at asking why question to the nominal question why do we have two eyes why don't we have four eyes or
00:14:16 three eyes or something well no there's probably a there is a function to that but it's we're not very good at
00:14:21 answering those questions we can speculate endlessly where biology is very or science is very good about
00:14:26 mechanistic question why is that charged in the universe right we find a certain universe where there positive negative
00:14:31 charges why why does quantum mechanics Hall you know what why doesn't some other theory hold
00:14:37 quantum mechanics hold in our universe is very unclear why so Tillie nominal question why questions are difficult to
00:14:43 answer clearly there's some relationship between complexity brain processing power and consciousness but however in
00:14:51 these cases in these three examples RK I gave one is an everyday experience at night the other one is a young Tom on
00:14:57 third one it's in principle you can everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences you have a
00:15:03 dissociation of function form of intelligence from from conscious no consciousness you caught me asking a
00:15:13 white question let me ask a question that's not a white question you're giving a talk later today on the Turing
00:15:18 test for intelligence and consciousness drawing lines between the two so is there a scientific way to say there's
00:15:26 consciousness present in this entity or not and to anticipate your answer because you also there's a neurobiological
00:15:35 answer so we can test a human brain but if you take a machine brain that you don't know tests for yet how would you
00:15:44 even begin to approach a test if there's consciousness present in this thing okay that's a really good question so let me
00:15:49 take in two steps so as you point out for for for for humans let's just stick with humans there's now a test called
00:15:57 the zap and zip it's a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation you look at the
00:16:03 electrical reverberations essentially using EEG and then you can measure the complexity of this plain response and
00:16:09 you can do this in a way people in asleep normal people you can do it in a wake people and then anesthetize them
00:16:16 you can do it in patients and it's it it has hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases when you're clear the
00:16:21 patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious the complexity is either high or low and then you can
00:16:26 adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and and and mice that have very similar brains
00:16:33 now of course you you point out that may not help you because we don't have a cortex you know and if I send a magnetic
00:16:39 pulse into my iPhone or my computer it's probably gonna break something so we don't have that so what we need
00:16:46 ultimately we need a theory of consciousness we can't just rely on our intuition our intuition is well yeah if
00:16:53 somebody talks they're conscious however then they're all these page children babies don't talk right but we believe
00:16:59 that that the babies also have conscious experiences right and then there are these patients I mentioned did and they
00:17:05 don't talk when you dream you can't talk because you're paralyzed so so what would we ultimately need we can't just
00:17:11 rely on our intuition we need a theory of constants that tells us what is it about a piece of matter what is it about
00:17:17 a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that give rise to conscious experience we all
00:17:23 believe none of us believe anymore in the old story it's a soul but that used to be the most common explanation that
00:17:28 most people accept that in still a lot of people today believe well there's there's God and doubt only us was a
00:17:35 special thing that animals don't have Rene Descartes famously said a dog if he hit it with your carriage may Yelp me
00:17:41 cry but it doesn't have this special thing it doesn't have the magic the magic salt oh yeah
00:17:46 it doesn't have restaurants the soul now we believe that isn't the case anymore so what is the difference between brains
00:17:56 and and these guys silicon and in particular once a behavior matches so if you have cereal of tea or Alexan 20
00:18:02 years from now that she can talk just as good as any possible human what counts do you have to say she's not conscious
00:18:08 in particular if she says it's of course he well cuz I'm conscious you are sir are you doing and she'll say well you
00:18:16 know they will generate some way to yeah she'll behave like a like a person now there are several differences one is so
00:18:25 this relates to the problem they're very hard why is consciousness a hard problem it's because it's subjective right only I
00:18:33 have it for only I know I've direct experience of my own consciousness I don't have experience your consciousness
00:18:40 now I assume as a sort of Bayesian person who believes in probability theory and all of that you know I can do
00:18:45 I can do an abduction to the to the best available facts I deduce your brain is very similar to mine if I put you in a
00:18:50 scanner your brain is graphic on a behavior same with I do if if you know if I give you this muesli and ask you
00:18:57 how does it taste you tell me things that you know that that I would also say more or less I yes so I infer based on
00:19:02 all of that that you're conscious now we're silly I can't do that so there I really need a theory that tells me what
00:19:09 is it about above any system this or this it makes it conscious and we have such a theory yes so the the integrator
00:19:16 information theory is but let me first maybe his introduction for people are not familiar the car can you you talked
00:19:24 a lot about pants psychism can you describe what physicalism versus dualism this you mentioned the soul what what is
00:19:34 the history of that idea what the idea psychism although the debate really out of which pan site-- chasm can emerge of
00:19:47 dualism versus physicalism or do you not see pants psychism is fitting into that and no you can argue there's some well
00:19:53 ok so let's step back so kemp psychism is a very ancient belief that's been around I mean Plato and us
00:20:00 talks about it modern philosophers talk about it of course in Buddhism the idea is very prevalent that I mean the
00:20:07 different versions of it one version says everything is in sold everything arcs and stones and dogs and people and
00:20:14 forests and iPhones all of us all right all matter is in soil that's sort of one version another version is that all
00:20:22 biology all creatures small a large from a single cell to a giant sequoia tree feel like something that's one I think
00:20:28 is somewhat more realistic so the different were willing me invite feel like something I have have feeling
00:20:35 have some kind of like some it may well be possible that it feels like something to be a Paramecium I think it's pretty
00:20:41 likely it feels like something to be a bee or a mouse or dog sure so okay so so that you can see that's also so pants
00:20:52 item is very bored and you can to some people for example Bertrand Russell try to advocate this for this idea it's
00:21:00 called gazelian monism that that pant psychism is really physics viewed from the inside so the idea is that physics
00:21:08 is very good at describing relationship among objects like charges or like gravity all right you know this card the
00:21:15 relationship between curvature and mass distribution okay that's the relationship among thing physics doesn't
00:21:20 really describe the ultimate reality itself it's just relationship among you know quarks or all these other stuffs
00:21:27 from like a third-person observer yeah yes and consciousness is what physics feels from the inside so my conscious
00:21:35 experience it's a way the physics of my brain particular my cortex feel from the inside and so if you are Paramecium you
00:21:42 gotta remember you see Paramecium well that's a pretty dumb creature this but it has already a billion different
00:21:49 molecules probably you know five thousand different proteins assembled in a highly highly complex system that no
00:21:55 single person no computer system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate its complexity
00:22:02 vastly escapes us yes and it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit now it doesn't have a voice in the
00:22:06 head like me it doesn't have expectations you know it doesn't have all that complex things but it may well
00:22:13 if you like something yep so this is really interesting can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the
00:22:21 difference between life intelligence and consciousness how do you see all of those if you have to define what is a
00:22:29 living thing what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent thing do those intermix for you or they totally
00:22:35 separate okay so a that's a question that we don't have a full answer right after a lot of this stuff we're talking
00:22:41 about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones right it was approximately can go to Aristotle who's
00:22:46 probably the most important scientists and philosophers ever lived in certainly in Western culture he had this idea it's
00:22:52 called halo morphism it's quite popular these days that there are different forms of soul the soul is really the
00:22:58 form of something he saw he says all biological creature have a vegetative soul that's life principle today we
00:23:03 think we understand something molded it's biochemistry nonlinear thermodynamics all right then he says
00:23:11 they have a sensitive so only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or an appetitive soul they they can see
00:23:18 they can smell and they have drives they want to repeat use they want to eat etc and then only humans have what he called
00:23:26 a rational soul okay right and that idea that made it into christen dome and then the rational soul is the one that lives
00:23:32 forever he was very young he wasn't really I mean different readings of Aristotle give different was that did he
00:23:37 believe that rational soul was immortal or not I probably think he didn't but then of course that made it into its who
00:23:42 Plato in the Christianity and then this world became immortal and then became the connection where after to God now
00:23:50 you so you ask me essentially you what does our modern conception of these free Aristotle would have called them
00:23:57 different forms life we think we know something about it at least life on this planet right although we don't
00:24:02 understand how to originate it but it's it's been difficult to rigorously pin down you see this in modern definition
00:24:09 of death it's in de facto right now there's a conference ongoing again that tries to defined
00:24:15 legally and medically what is death it used to be very simple des is you stop breathing your heart stops beating
00:24:20 you're dead right yeah totally unconverted if you're unsure you wait another 10 minutes if the patient doesn't breathe
00:24:25 you know he's well now we have ventilators we have half a pacemaker so it's much more
00:24:30 difficult to define what death is typically des is defined at the end of life and life is defined before yes so
00:24:37 before that okay so we don't have really very good definitions intelligence we don't have a rigorous data definition we
00:24:43 know something how to measure it's called IG IQ or G factors right and and we're beginning to build it in in a
00:24:51 narrow sense right like go alphago and and and and Watson and you know Google cars and uber cars and all of that that
00:24:58 still narrow AI and some people are thinking about the artificial general intelligence but roughly as we said
00:25:03 before it's something lose ability to learn and to adapt to new environments but that is as I said also it's radical
00:25:11 difference from experience and it's very unclear if you build a machine that has AGI it's not at all a priori it's not at
00:25:18 all clear that this machine will have consciousness it may or may not so let's ask it the other way do you think if you
00:25:24 were to try to build an artificial general intelligence system do you think figuring out how to build artificial
00:25:34 consciousness would help you get to an AGI so or put another way do you think intelligent requires consciousness in
00:25:42 human it goes hand in hand in human or I think Ambala G consciousness intelligence goes hand in
00:25:49 hand quite a solution because the the brain evolved to be highly complex complexity via the theory integrated
00:25:56 information theory is sort of ultimately is what is closely tied to consciousness ultimately it's causal power upon itself
00:26:03 and so in evolution evolved systems they go together in artificial system particular in digital machines they do
00:26:09 not go together and if you asked me point-blank is Alexa 20 point O in the year 2041 she can easily pass every Turing test is she
00:26:19 conscious no even if she claims she's concerts in fact you could even do a more radical version of this thought
00:26:25 experiment we can build a computer simulation of the human brain you know what Henry Markram
00:26:30 in the Blue Brain Project or the human brain project in Switzerland is trying to do let's grant him all the success so
00:26:34 in ten years we have this perfect simulation of the human brain every new one is simulated in
00:26:40 hasil Amex and it has motor neurons it has a Ibaka's area and of course it'll talk and it'll say hi I just woken up I
00:26:47 feel great okay even that computer simulation that can imprint some map on to your brain will not be conscious why
00:26:53 because it simulates it's a difference between the simulated and the real so it simulates the behavior salted with
00:27:00 consciousness it might be it will if it's done properly will have all the intelligence that that particular person
00:27:06 they're simulating has but simulating intelligence is not the same as having conscious experiences and I'll give you
00:27:12 a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists stupidly get I can write down in Stein's field equation nine or
00:27:19 ten equations that describe the link in general relativity between curvature and and mass I can do that I can run this on
00:27:28 my laptop to to predict that the sample the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be so massive that it will
00:27:36 twist space-time around it so no light can escape I it's a black hole right but funny have you ever won that why doesn't
00:27:43 this computer simulation suck me in alright it simulates gravity but it doesn't have the causal power of gravity
00:27:50 it's a huge difference so it's a difference between the real and and the simulator just like it doesn't get wet
00:27:56 inside the computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather storm and so in order to have to have
00:28:03 artificial continents you have to give it the same causal power as a human brain yes you have to build so-called a
00:28:10 neuromorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar to the human brain not a digital clock for normal computer
00:28:19 so that's just to clarify though you think that consciousness is not required to create human level intelligence it
00:28:28 seems to accompany in the human brain but for a machine not of court so maybe just because this is AGI let's dig in a
00:28:37 little bit about what we mean by intelligence so one thing is the G factor these kind of IQ tests of
00:28:46 intelligence but I think if you maybe another way to say so in 2040 2050 people will have Siri that is
00:28:55 just really impressive do you think people will say serious intelligent yes intelligence is this amorphous thing so
00:29:03 it to be intelligent it seems like you have to have some kind of connections with other human beings in a sense that
00:29:09 you have to impress them with your intelligence and their feels you have to somehow operate in this world full of
00:29:18 humans and for that there feels like there has to be something like consciousness so you think you can have
00:29:25 just the world's best natural NLP system natural language understanding a generation and that will be that will
00:29:32 get us happy and say you know what we've created an AGI I don't know happy no well yes I do believe we can get what we
00:29:41 call high-level functional intelligence particular sort of the G you know this this fluid like intelligence that we
00:29:48 cherish particularly the place like MIT right in in in machines I see a boy I know reasons and I see a lot of reason
00:29:55 to believe it's gonna happen very you know over the next 50 years of 30 years so for beneficial AI for creating an AI
00:30:04 system that's so you mentioned ethics that is exceptionally intelligent but also does not do does you know aligns
00:30:12 its values with our values as humanity do you think then in his consciousness yes I think that that is a very good
00:30:19 argument that if we're concerned about AI and the threat of a aisle and Nick Bostrom accidentally said I think having
00:30:27 an intelligent that has empathy right why do we find abusing a dog why do most of us find that apartment abusing any
00:30:33 animal right why do we find that apartment because we have this thing called empathy which if you look at the
00:30:40 Greek really means feeling with I feel a compass of empathy I have feeling with you I see somebody else suffer that isn't
00:30:47 even my conspecific it's not a person it's not a lot but it's not my wife or my kids it's it's a dog but I feel
00:30:53 naturally most of us not all of us most of us will feel emphatic and so it may well be in the long-term interest of
00:31:02 survival of Homo sapiens sapiens that if we do build AGI and it really becomes very powerful
00:31:08 that it has an emphatic response and doesn't just exterminate humanity so as part of the full conscious experience to
00:31:17 create a consciousness artificial or in our human consciousness do you think fear maybe we're gonna get into the
00:31:25 earlier days with Mitch and so on but do you think fear and suffering are essential to have consciousness do you
00:31:32 have to have the full range of experience of it to have a system that has experience or can you have a system
00:31:39 that only has a very particular kinds of very positive experiences look you can have in principle you can people have
00:31:46 done this in the rat where you implanted electrode in the hypothalamus the pleasure center of the head and the rat
00:31:52 stimulated some above and beyond anything else it doesn't care about food or natural sex or drink anymore to
00:31:58 stimulate itself because it's it's such a pleasurable feeling I guess it's like an orgasm just you have you know all day
00:32:06 long and so a priori I see no reason why you need different forever I need a great variety now clearly to survive
00:32:15 that wouldn't work but if I'd engineered artificially I don't think I don't think you need a great variety of conscious
00:32:24 expense you could have just pleasure or just fear it might be a terrible existence but I think that's possible at
00:32:31 least on conceptual logical count cause any real creature whether artificially engineered you want to give it fear the
00:32:38 fear of extinction that we all have and you also want to give it a positive appetitive states states that it wants
00:32:44 to that you want the Machine encouraged to do because if they give the Machine positive feedback so you mentioned
00:32:52 pants.i chasm to jump back a little bit you know everything having some kind of mental property how do you go from there
00:33:02 to something like human consciousness so everything having some elements of consciousness - well is there something
00:33:08 special about human consciousness what so so just it's not everything like a spoon there's no I the the form of Pam Jochum
00:33:16 I think about doesn't ask I consciousness - anything like this the spoon my liver however it is the theory the
00:33:24 integrated information theory does say that system even ones that look from the outside relatively simple Atlee if they
00:33:31 have this internal causal power they are they it does feel like something the theory a poet doesn't see anything
00:33:39 what's special about human biologically we know what the one thing that special about human is we speak and we have a
00:33:46 overblown sense of our own importance right we believe we exceptional and where does God's give - - into the universe but the
00:33:55 but behaviorally the main thing that we have we can plant we can plan over the long term and we have language and that
00:34:01 gives us enormous amount of power and that's why we are there the current dominant species on the planet
00:34:08 so you mentioned God you grow up a devout Roman Catholic you know Roman Catholic family so you know with
00:34:16 consciousness you're sort of exploring some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also touches on so
00:34:24 where does where does religion fit into your thinking about consciousness and you've you've grown throughout your life
00:34:30 and changed your views and religion as far as I understand yeah I mean I'm now much closer to so I'm not a Roman
00:34:37 Catholic anymore I don't believe there's sort of this God the God I was I was educated to believe in you know sits
00:34:44 somewhere in the fullness of time I'll be united in some sort of everlasting bliss I just don't see any evidence for
00:34:51 that look the world the night is large and full of Wonders right there are many things that I don't understand I think
00:34:58 many things that we as a cult I look we don't even understand more than four percent of all the universe right dark
00:35:03 matter dark energy we have no idea what it is maybe it's lost socks what do I know so so all I can tell you is it's a
00:35:11 sort of mom my current religious or spiritual sentiments much closer to some form of Buddhism can you - without the reincarnation
00:35:19 unfortunately there's no evidence for in reincarnation so can you describe the way Buddhism sees the world a little bit
00:35:27 well so the you know they talk about so when when I spent several meetings with with the Dalai Lama and what always
00:35:32 impressed me about him he really unlike for example at either the Pope was some Cardinal he
00:35:38 always emphasized minimizing the suffering of all creatures so they have this from the early beginning they look
00:35:45 at suffering in all creatures not just in people but in in everybody this universal and of course by degrees right
00:35:50 in an animal Jerell will have less is less capable of suffering than a then a well developed
00:35:59 normally developed human and they think consciousness pervades in this universe and they have these techniques you know
00:36:06 you can think of them like mindfulness etc and meditation that tries to access sort of what they claim of this more
00:36:13 fundamental aspect of reality I'm not sure it's more fundamentalist I think about it there's a physical and then
00:36:18 this is inside view consciousness and those are the two aspects that's the only thing I've I have access to in my
00:36:24 life and you gotta remember my conscious experience and your conscious experience comes prior to anything you know about
00:36:30 physics comes PI to knowledge about the universe and atoms and super strings and molecules and all of that the only thing
00:36:37 you directly are acquainted with is this world that's populated with with things in images and and sounds in your head
00:36:43 and touches on all of that I actually have a question so and it sounds like you kind of have a rich life you talk
00:36:50 about rock climbing and it seems like you really love literature and consciousness is all about experiencing
00:36:58 things so do you think that has helped your research on this topic yes particular if you think about it the
00:37:05 the various states so for example you do our climbing or now I do oink-cool going and a bike every day you
00:37:12 can get into this thing called the zone and I've always I want to I want to Bob about a particular with respect to
00:37:17 consciousness because it's a strangely addictive state you want to you want to appear I mean once people have it once
00:37:23 you want to keep on going back to it and you wonder what is it so addicting about it and I think it's the experience of
00:37:31 almost close to pure experience because in this in the zone you're not conscious over in a voice anymore but there's
00:37:36 always this inner voice nagging you right you have to do this you have to do that you have to pay your taxes yet this
00:37:40 fight was your ex and all of those things are always there but when you're in the zone all of that is gone
00:37:46 and your justice in this wonderful state while you're fully out in the world a job you're climbing or you're hauling or
00:37:52 biking or doing soccer what or whatever you're doing and sort of consciousness sort of is is your all action or in this
00:37:59 case of pure experience you're not action at all but in both cases you experience some aspect of of can't you
00:38:07 touch some basic part of off of conscious existence that is so basic and so deeply satisfying you I think you
00:38:15 touch the root of being that's really what you're touching there you're getting close to the root of being and
00:38:20 that's very different from intelligence so what do you think about the simulation hypothesis simulation theory
00:38:26 the idea that we all live in a computer simulation have you knowit's justice for her I think it's as likely as the
00:38:36 hypothesis had engaged hundreds of scholars for many centuries are we all just existing in the mind of God right
00:38:43 right and this is just a modern version of it it's it's it's it's equally plausible people love talking about
00:38:50 these sorts of things I know their book written is about the simulation hypothesis if that's what people want to
00:38:55 do that's fine it seems rather esoteric it's never testable but it's not useful for you to think of in those terms so
00:39:02 maybe connecting to the questions of free will which you've talked about I think vaguely wherever you saying that
00:39:10 the idea that there's no free will it makes you very uncomfortable so what do you think about free will and from that
00:39:18 you from a physics perspective or a consciousness perspective what is it all okay so from the physics perspective
00:39:24 leaving inside quantum mechanics we believe we live in a fully deterministic world right but then comes of course
00:39:29 quantum mechanics so now we know that certain things on principle not predictable which as you said I prefer
00:39:36 because the idea that at the initial condition of the universe and then everything else we're just acting out
00:39:41 the initial condition of the universe that doesn't that doesn't mean it's not a romantic notion no certainly not right
00:39:48 now when it comes to consciousness I think we do have certain freedom we are much more constrained by a physics of
00:39:54 course and by our past and by our own conscious desires and what our parents told us and
00:39:59 what our environment tells us we we all know that our there's hundreds of experiments that show how we can be
00:40:04 influenced but finally in the in the final analysis when you make a lifetime talk not really about critical decision
00:40:10 what you really think should I marriage should I go to this school that could should I take this job is that job
00:40:18 should I cheat on my taxes or not these sort of these are things what you really deliberate and I think under those
00:40:23 conditions you are as free as you can be when you when you bring your entire being anti conscious being to that
00:40:32 question and try to analyze it on all the the various condition and then you take you make a decision you are as free
00:40:39 as you can ever be that is I think what what free will is it's not a will that's totally free to do anything it wants
00:40:47 that's not possible right so as Jack mentioned yet you actually read a blog about books you've read amazing books
00:40:56 from I'm Russian from Bulgakov cha oh yeah Neil Gaiman Carl Sagan Murakami so what is a book that early in your life
00:41:06 transformed the way you saw the world something that changed your life Nietzsche against did that spokes are
00:41:13 twister because he talks about some of these problems you know he was one of the first discoverer of the unconscious
00:41:20 this is you know a little bit before for it when it was in the air and you know he makes all these claims that people
00:41:27 sort of under the guise or under the mask of charity actually are very non charitable so he sort of really the
00:41:37 first discoverer of the great land of the of the unconscious and that that really struck me and what do you think
00:41:43 what do you think about the unconscious what do you think about Freud we think about these ideas what's what's just
00:41:50 like dark matter in the universe what's over there in that unconscious a lot I mean much more than we think this is
00:41:56 what a lot of last hundred years of research has shown so I think he was a genius misguided towards the end but he
00:42:01 was all he started out as a neuroscientist but he contributed he did the studies on the on the lamprey he
00:42:09 contributed himself to the neon hypothesis the idea that there discreet units that we call nerve cells
00:42:16 now and then he started then he he vote you know about the unconscious and I think it's to there's lots of stuff
00:42:22 happening you feel this particular when you're in a relationship and it breaks a son alright and then you have this
00:42:28 terrible you can have love and hate and lust and anger and all of its mixed in and when you try to analyze yourself why
00:42:36 am I so upset it's very very difficult to penetrate to those basements those caverns in your mind because the prying
00:42:44 eyes of conscience doesn't have access to those but they're they are made in the amygdala or you know lots of other
00:42:49 places they make you upset or angry or sad or depressed and it's very difficult to try to actually uncover the reason
00:42:55 you can go to a shrink you can talk with your friend endlessly you couldn't start finally a story why
00:43:00 this happened why you love you or don't love or whatever but you don't really know whether that's actually the with
00:43:06 that that actually happened because you simply don't have access to those parts of the brain and they're very powerful
00:43:11 you think that's a feature or a bug of our brain the fact that we have this deep difficult to dive into subconscious
00:43:18 I think it's a feature because otherwise look we are we are see is like any other brain or nervous system or computer we
00:43:30 are severely band-limited if we if everything I do every emotion I feel every my movements I make if all of that
00:43:35 had to be another control of consciousness I couldn't I I couldn't I wouldn't be here all right so so what
00:43:44 you do early on your brain you have to be conscious when you learn things like typing or like riding on a bike but then
00:43:51 you what you do you train up or out I think that involve basal ganglia and stratum you bear you train up different
00:43:57 parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like typing you can show you do it much faster without even
00:44:02 thinking about it because you've got this highly specialized what Francis Crick and I called zombie agents that
00:44:08 are sort of that taking care of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the
00:44:12 text you want to write and I think that's true for many many things but for the things like all the fights you have
00:44:21 with the ex-girlfriend things that you would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the sub
00:44:26 conscious so that seems like a bug that it would stay there you think it would be better if you can analyze it and then
00:44:32 get it out of there or just forget it ever happened you know that that seems a very buggy kind of well yeah but in
00:44:39 general we don't have and that's probably functional we don't have an ability unless it's extremely of cases
00:44:45 clinical dissociations right when people are heavily abused when they completely repress them they the memory but that
00:44:52 doesn't happen in in in you know in normal people if we don't have an ability to remove traumatic memories and
00:44:59 of course we suffer from that on the other hand probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memory
00:45:05 you probably do it to an extent that isn't useful to you so yeah it's a good question with the
00:45:13 balance so on the books is Jack mentioned correct me if I'm wrong but broadly speaking in academia and the
00:45:20 different scientific disciplines certainly an engineering reading literature seems to be a rare pursuit
00:45:27 perhaps I'm wrong in this but that's in my experience most people are read much more technical text and do not sort of
00:45:36 escape or seek truth in literature it seems like you do so what do you think is the value what do you think
00:45:42 literature asks the pursuit of scientific truth do you think it's good it's useful for given access to much
00:45:52 wider array of human experiences how valuable do you think it is well if you want to understand human nature and
00:45:58 nature in general then I think you have to better understand wide variety of experiences not just sitting in a lab
00:46:05 staring at a screen and having a face flashed onto you've won a million pushing a button that's what that's what
00:46:10 I used to do that for most psychologists do there's nothing wrong with that but you need to consider lots of other
00:46:17 strange states you know and literature is a shortcut for this well yeah as literature that's that's what literature
00:46:22 is all about all sorts of interesting experiences that people have the you know the contingency of it the fact that
00:46:29 you know women experience what different black people experience the world different and you know the one way to
00:46:34 explain that is reading all these different literature and try to find out you you see everything so relative
00:46:39 read eBooks million years ago they thought about certain problems very very differently than us today we today like
00:46:46 any culture think we know it all that's common to every culture every culture believes that at a day they know it all
00:46:51 and then you realize well there's other ways of viewing the universe and some of them may have lots of things in their
00:46:58 favor so I this is a question I wanted to ask about time scale or scale in general when you with IIT or in general
00:47:06 try to think about consciousness try to think about these ideas we kind of naturally think in human timescales
00:47:16 do you or and also entities that are sized close to humans do you think of things that are much larger much smaller
00:47:22 its containing consciousness and do you think of things that take you know well is this you know it ages eons to  to
00:47:33 operate in their conscious cause effect cause effect it's a very good question so I think a lot about small creatures
00:47:38 because experimentally you know a lot of people work on fly then and bees alright so and most people just think they are
00:47:44 tormented a this box for heaven's sake right but if you look at their behavior like bees they can recognize individual
00:47:50 humans they have this very complicated way to communicate if you've ever been involved or you know your parents when
00:47:55 they bought a house what sort of agonizing decision that is and bees have to do that once a year right when they
00:48:01 swarm in this spring and then they have this very lab that way they have three nut Scouts it did they go to the
00:48:06 individual sites they come back there this power this dance literally where they danced for several days they try to
00:48:11 recruit other needs is that a complicated decision wait when they finally want to make a decision the
00:48:16 entire swarm the scouts warm up the entire swarm then go to one location they don't go to fifty location they go
00:48:21 to one location that the scouts have agreed upon by themselves that's awesome if you look at the circuit complexity
00:48:26 it's 10 times more denser than anything we have in our brain or the only of a million neurons but then you know it's
00:48:31 amazing complex complex behavior very complicated circuitry so there's no question they experience something their
00:48:36 life is very different they're tiny they only live you know for four workers live maybe for two months so I think IIT
00:48:45 tells you this in principle the substrate of consciousness is the substrate that maximizes the
00:48:51 cause-effect power over all possible space temple grains so when I think about for example do you know the science fiction
00:48:57 story the black cloud okay it's a classic by Fred Hoyle the astronomer he has this cloud intervening between the
00:49:05 earth and the sand the Sun and leading to some sort of to global cooling this is written in the 50s it turns out you
00:49:12 can using the the radio dish they communicate was actually an entity it's actually an intelligent entity and they
00:49:19 they sort of they convinced it to move away so here you have a radical different entity and in principle IT
00:49:25 says well you can measure the the integrated information in principle at least and yes if that if the maximum of
00:49:31 that occurs at a time scale of month rather than enough it sort of fraction of a second yes and they would
00:49:38 experience life where each moment is a month rather than or microsecond right rather than a fraction of a second in in
00:49:48 the human case and so there may be forms of constants that we simply don't recognize for what they are because they
00:49:54 are so radically different from anything you and I are used to again that's why it's good to read or to watch science
00:50:00 fiction what we want to think about this like this is friend you know Stanislav LEM this polish science fiction writer
00:50:06 he wrote Solaris I was turned into a Hollywood movie yes his best novel it was in the 60s if
00:50:11 there is a very ingenious and engineering background his most interesting novel is called the
00:50:17 victorious where human civilization they they they they they have this mission to this planet and everything is destroyed
00:50:24 and they discover machines humans got killed and then these machines took or when there was a machine evolution a
00:50:30 Darwinian evolution he talks about this very vividly and finally the dominant they're the dominant machine
00:50:37 intelligence organism that survive they're gigantic clouds of little hexagonal Universal salata mater this is
00:50:44 what in the Cygnus so typically they are all lying on the ground individual by themselves but in times of crisis they
00:50:50 can't communicate the assembly into gigantic Nets into clouds trillions of these particles and then they become
00:50:56 hyper intelligent and they can beat anything that Youmans can can control at it it's a very beautiful and compelling
00:51:04 where you have an intelligence where finally the humans leave the planet they simply unable to
00:51:09 understand and comprehend this creature and they can say well either we can nuke the entire plan and destroy it or we
00:51:14 just have to leave because fundamentally it's an it's an alien it's so alien from us and our ideas that we cannot
00:51:20 communicate with them yeah actually in conversation so your talent US Steel or from brought up is
00:51:29 that there could be his ideas you know you already have these artificial general intelligence like super smart or
00:51:35 maybe conscious beings in the cellular Tom so we just don't know how to talk to them so it's the language the
00:51:40 communication because you don't know what to do with it so that's one sort of view is consciousness there's only
00:51:48 something you can measure so it's not conscious if you can't measure it but so you're making an ontological and an
00:51:54 epistemic statement one is there they are it's it's just like seeing their multiverses that might be true but I
00:52:00 can't communicate with them I don't have I can't have any also that's an epistemic argument right so those are
00:52:04 two different things so may well be possible look at not in other case that's happening right now people are
00:52:09 building these mini organoids do you know about this so you know you can take stem cells from under your arm
00:52:14 put in one dish add four transcription factors and then you can induce them to code to go into large or large they're a
00:52:20 few millimeters they're like a half a million neurons that look like matter of cells in a dish called mini organoids
00:52:26 at Howard at Stanford everywhere they're building them it may be well be possible that they're beginning to feel like
00:52:31 something but we we can't really communicate with them right now so people are beginning to think about the
00:52:37 ethics of this right so yes he may be perfectly right but they made its one question are they conscious or not it's
00:52:43 totally separate question how would I know those are two different things right if you could give advice to a
00:52:51 young researcher sort of dreaming of understanding or creating human level intelligence or consciousness what would
00:52:59 you say follow your dreams read widely no I mean I suppose what discipline what what is
00:53:08 the pursuit that they should take on is it neuroscience this is a competition cognitive science is it philosophy is a
00:53:15 computer science or products no in in a sense that okay so the only known system that have high level of
00:53:24 intelligence is Homo sapiens so if you wanted to build it it's probably good to continue to study closely what humans do
00:53:30 so cognitive neuroscience you know somewhere between cognitive neuroscience on the one hand and some philosophy of
00:53:37 mind and then ai ai computer science you can look at all the original ideas in your network they all came from
00:53:44 neuroscience right reinforcement whether it's snarky Minsky building is snarky or whether it's you know the early supalen
00:53:49 visa experiment that how about that then gave rise to networks and then multi-layer networks so it may well be
00:53:55 possible in fact some people argue that to make the next big step in AI once we'll realize the limits of deep
00:54:01 convolutional net works but they can do certain things but they can't really understand but they don't they don't
00:54:07 really can't really I can't really show them one image I can show you a single image of some knee a pickpocket who
00:54:14 steals a wallet from a purse you immediately know that's a big pocket right now computer system will just say
00:54:19 well it's a man it's a woman it's a purse right unless you train this machine on showing it a hundred thousand
00:54:25 pickpockets right so it doesn't it doesn't have this easy understanding that you have right so so some people
00:54:31 make yeah I mean in order to go to the next step or you really want to build machines that understand in a way you
00:54:37 and I we have to go to psychology we need to understand how we do it and our brains enable us to do it and so
00:54:42 therefore being on the cusp it's also so exciting I'd to try to understand better our nature and then to build to take
00:54:48 some of those inside and build them so I think the most exciting thing is somewhere in the interface between
00:54:53 cognitive science neuroscience AI computer science and philosophy of mind beautiful yeah I'd say if there is from
00:54:59 the machine learning for from the computer science computer vision perspective many of the researchers kind
00:55:05 of ignore the way the human brain works nor even psychology or literature or studying the brain I would hope Josh
00:55:13 Tenenbaum talks about bringing that in more and more and that's yeah so you've worked on some amazing stuff throughout
00:55:22 your life what's the thing that you're really excited about what's the mystery that you would love to uncover in the
00:55:29 near term beyond beyond all the mysteries already surrounded by well so there's a
00:55:36 structure called the Klaus poem this is structures underneath our cortex it's yay big you have one on the left am
00:55:42 i right underneath this pie underneath a insula it's very sane it's like one millimeter it's embedded in in wiring in
00:55:48 white matters it's very difficult to image and it has it has connection to every cortical region and Francis Crick
00:55:57 the last paper you have of all he dictated Corrections the day he died in hospital on this paper
00:56:03 he now we hyper hypothesize well because it has this unique Anatomy it gets input from every cortical area and projects
00:56:09 back to every call every cortical area that the function of this structure is similar that it's just a metaphor to
00:56:17 work the role of a conducting and symphony orchestra you've all the different cortical
00:56:21 players you have some that do motion some they do theory of mind some that infer social interaction and color I'm
00:56:26 hearing and all the different modules and cortex but of course what consciousness is consciousness puts it
00:56:32 all together into one package like the binding problem all of that and this is really the function because it has a
00:56:38 relatively few nuance compared to cortex but it it talks it is all receive the input from all of them and it projects
00:56:44 back to all of them and so we are testing that right now we've got this beautiful neuronal reconstruction in the
00:56:50 mouse called crown of song and town of Thal nuan said there in the closed room that if the most widespread connection
00:56:56 of any nerve Neon I've ever seen they're very deep yeah you have individually on to sit in the clouds from tiny but then
00:57:01 they have this very single you have this huge axonal tree that cover both FC and contralateral cortex and and trying to
00:57:09 turn using you know fancy tools like optogenetics trying to turn those neurons on or off and study it what
00:57:15 happens in them in the mouse so this thing is perhaps where the parts become the whole it very interface it's one of
00:57:23 the structures it's a very good way of putting it where the the individual parts turn into the whole of the whole
