00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Chris Urmson he was a CTO of the Google self-driving car team a key engineer and
00:00:08 leader behind the Carnegie Mellon University autonomous vehicle entries in the DARPA Grand Challenges and the
00:00:15 winner of the DARPA urban challenge today he's the CEO of Aurora innovation and the autonomous vehicle software
00:00:22 company he started with sterling Anderson who was the former director of Tesla autopilot and drew back now Uber's
00:00:29 former autonomy and perception lead chris is one of the top roboticists and autonomous vehicle experts in the world
00:00:37 and a longtime voice of reason in a space that is shrouded in both mystery and hype he both acknowledges the
00:00:44 incredible challenges involved in solving the problem of autonomous driving and is working hard to solve it

00:01:08 conversation with Chris Armisen you were part of both the DARPA Grand Challenge and the DARPA urban challenge
00:01:17 teams at CMU with red Whittaker what technical or philosophical things have you learned from these races I think the
00:01:25 the high order bit was that it could be done I think that was the thing that was incredible about the first the the Grand
00:01:36 Challenges that I remember you know I was a grad student at Carnegie Mellon and there we was kind of this dichotomy
00:01:46 of it seemed really hard so that'd be cool and interesting but you know at the time we were the only robotics Institute
00:01:54 around and so if we went into it and fell on our faces that would that would be embarrassing so I think you know just
00:02:01 having the will to go do it to try to do this thing that at the time was marked as you know darn near impossible and and
00:02:07 then after a couple of tries be able to actually make it happen I think that was you know that was really exciting but at
00:02:14 which point did you believe it was possible did you from the very beginning did you personally because you're one of the
00:02:20 lead engineer you actually had to do a lot of the work yeah I was the technical director there and did al huddle the
00:02:26 work along with a bunch of other really good people did I believe it could be done yeah of
00:02:32 course right like why would you go do something you thought was impossible completely impossible we thought it was
00:02:37 gonna be hard we didn't know how we're gonna be able to do it we didn't know if we'd be able to do it the first time
00:02:45 turns out we couldn't that yeah I guess you have to I think there's a certain benefit to naivete
00:02:54 right that if you don't know how hard something really is you you try different things and you know gives you
00:03:01 an opportunity that others who are you know wiser maybe don't don't have what were the biggest pain points mechanical
00:03:09 sensors hardware software algorithms for mapping localization just general perception control what the hardware
00:03:16 soft first of all I think that's the joy of this field is that it's all hard and that's you have to be good at at each
00:03:26 part of it so for the first for the urban challenges if I look back at it from today
00:03:37 it should be easy today that you know it was a static world there weren't other actors moving through it that is what
00:03:43 that means it was out in the desert so you get really good GPS you know so that that went in you know we could map it
00:03:53 roughly and so in retrospect now it's you know it's it's within the realm of things we could do back then just
00:03:59 actually getting the vehicle and the you know there's a bunch of engineering work to get the vehicle so that we could
00:04:04 control and drive it that's you know that's still a pain today but it was even more so back then and then the
00:04:12 uncertainty of exactly what they wanted us to do was was part of the challenge as well right you didn't actually know
00:04:19 the track heading in you know approximately but you know it didn't actually know the route the route that's
00:04:24 gonna be taken that's right we didn't know the route we didn't even really the way the rules had been described you had
00:04:31 to kind of guess so if you think back to that challenge the idea was to that the the government would give us the DARPA
00:04:39 would give us a set of waypoints and kind of the width that you had to stay within between the line that went
00:04:46 between you know each of those waypoints and so the the most devious thing they could have done is set you know a
00:04:52 kilometer wide corridor across you know a field of scrub brush and rocks and said you know go figure it out
00:05:00 fortunately it really it turned into basically driving along a set of trails which you know is much more relevant to
00:05:07 to the application they were looking for but no it was it was a hell of a thing back in the day so the legend read was
00:05:16 kind of leading that effort in terms just broadly speaking so you're a leader now what have you learned from reading
00:05:25 about leadership I think there's a couple things one is you know go and try those really hard things that that's
00:05:33 where there is an incredible opportunity I think the other big one though is to see people for who they can be not who
00:05:42 they are it's one of the things that I actually one of the deepest lessons I learned from read was that he would look
00:05:50 at you know undergraduates or graduate students and empower them to be leaders to to you know have responsibility to do
00:06:03 great things that I think another person might look at them and think oh that's just you know another graduate student
00:06:09 what could they know and so I think that that you know kind of trust but verify I have confidence and what people can
00:06:15 become I think is a really powerful thing so through that it's just like fast-forward through the history can you
00:06:22 maybe talk through the technical evolution of autonomous vehicle systems from the first to Grand Challenges to
00:06:31 the urban challenge to today are there major shifts in your mind or is it the same kind of technology just made more
00:06:39 robust I think there's been some big big steps so the for the grand challenge the real technology that unlocked that was HD
00:06:52 mapping prior to that a lot of the off-road robotics work had been done without any real prior model of what the
00:07:01 vehicle was going to encounter and so that innovation that the fact that we could get you know decimeter resolution
00:07:13 models was really a big deal and that allowed us to to kind of bound the complexity of the driving problem the
00:07:20 vehicle had and allowed it to operate at speed because we could assume things about the environment that it was going
00:07:27 to encounter so that was a that was one of the that was the big step there for the urban challenge you know one of
00:07:39 the big technological innovations there was the multi beam lidar and being able to generate a high resolution you know
00:07:48 mid to long range 3d models the world and use that for you know for understanding the world around the
00:07:55 vehicle and that was really a you know kind of a game-changing technology in parallel with that we saw a bunch of
00:08:05 other technologies that have been kind of converging half their their day in the Sun so Bayesian estimation had been
00:08:17 you know slam had been a big field in robotics you know you would go to a conference you know a couple years
00:08:23 before that and every paper would effectively have slams somewhere in it and so seeing that you know that looks
00:08:31 Bayesian estimation techniques you know play out on a very visible stage you know I thought that was that was pretty
00:08:38 exciting to see and mostly slam was done based on lidar that time well yeah and in fact we
00:08:45 weren't really doing slam per se you know it you know in real time because we had a model ahead of time we had a road
00:08:51 map but we were doing localization and we were using you know the lidar or the cameras depending on you know who
00:08:57 exactly was doing it to localize to a model of the world and I thought that was that was a big step from kind of
00:09:06 naively trusting GPS I and s before that and and again like lots of work had been going on in this field certainly this
00:09:13 was not doing anything particularly innovative in slam over in localization but it was seeing that technology
00:09:21 necessary in a real application on a big stage I thought was very cool so for the urban challenge that was already maps
00:09:28 constructed offline yes in general okay and did people do that individually individual teams do it individually so
00:09:35 they had their own difference of different approaches there or they never really kind of
00:09:42 share that information at least intuitively so so the DARPA gave all the teams a a model of the world they you
00:09:52 know a map and then you know one of the things that we had to figure out back then was and it's still one of these
00:09:57 things that trips people up today is actually the coordinate system so you get a latitude longitude and you know -
00:10:05 so many decimal places you don't really care about kind of the ellipsoid of the earth that's being used but when you
00:10:12 want to get to ten centimeter or centimeter resolution you care whether the the core system is you know Nats 83
00:10:22 or wgs84 or you know these are different ways to describe both the the kind of non spherical nosov the earth but also
00:10:31 kind of the actually in I think I can't remember which one the tectonic shifts that are happening and how to transform
00:10:36 you know the the global datum as a function of that so you're getting a map and then actually matching it to reality
00:10:42 two centimeter resolution that was kind of interesting and fun back then so how much work was the perception doing there
00:10:50 so how how much were you relying on localization based on maps without using perception to register to the maps and
00:10:57 how I guess the question is how advanced was perception at that point it's certainly behind where we are today
00:11:03 right we're we're more than a decade since the graph or the urban challenge but the the core of it was there that we
00:11:13 were tracking vehicles we had to do that at a hundred plus meter range because we had to merge with other traffic we were
00:11:20 using you know Bayesian again Bayesian estimates for for state of these vehicles we had to deal with a bunch of
00:11:26 the problems that you you think of today of predicting what that where that vehicle is going to be a few seconds
00:11:32 into the future we had to deal with the fact that there were multiple hypotheses for that because a vehicle at an
00:11:37 intersection might be going right or it might be going straight or I'd be making a left turn
00:11:43 and we had to deal with the challenge of the fact that our behavior was going to impact the behavior of that other upper
00:11:50 operator and you know we did a lot of that in relative Najee relatively naive ways but it caused third still had to
00:11:57 have some kind of Thanos yeah and so where does that ten years later where does that take us today from that
00:12:04 artificial city construction to real cities to the urban environment yeah I think the the biggest thing is that the
00:12:13 you know the the actors are truly unpredictable that most of the time you know the drivers on the road the other
00:12:25 behaving well but everyone's father or not the variety of other vehicles is you know you have all of the intended
00:12:36 behavior in terms of perception or both that we have you know back then we didn't have to deal with cyclists we
00:12:41 didn't have to deal with pedestrians didn't have to deal with traffic lights you know the scale over which that you
00:12:49 have to operate us now you know is much larger than you know the airbase that we were thinking about back then
00:12:56 so what easy question what do you think is the hardest part about driving easy question yeah no I'm joking I I'm sure
00:13:05 no nothing really jumps out at you as one thing but in in the jump from the urban challenge to the real world is
00:13:15 there something that's a particularly for seus very serious difficult challenge I think the most fundamental
00:13:24 difference is that were doing it for real and that in that environment it was both a limited complexity environment
00:13:33 because certain actors weren't there because you know the roads were maintained there were barriers keeping
00:13:38 people separate from from robots at the time and it only had to work for 60 miles which looking at it from you know
00:13:47 2006 it had to work for 60 miles yeah right looking at it from now you know we we want things that will go and drive
00:13:56 for you know half a half a million miles and you know it's just a it's a different game so how important he said
00:14:06 leiter came into the game early on and it's really the primary driver of autonomous vehicles today as a sensor so
00:14:11 how important is the role of lidar in the sense of suite in the near term so I think it's I think it's essential you
00:14:19 know I believe it but I also believe is the cameras are essential and I believe the radars is essential I think that you
00:14:27 you really need to use the composition of data from from these different sensors if you want the thing to to
00:14:33 really be robust the question I want to ask let's see if we kind of tangle is what are your thoughts on the Elon Musk
00:14:40 provocative statement that lidar is a crutch that is the kind of I guess growing pains and that's much of the
00:14:50 perception tasks can be done with cameras so I think it is undeniable that people walk around without you know
00:14:59 lasers in their forehead and they can get into vehicles and drive them and and so there's an existence
00:15:08 proof that you can drive using you know passive fission no doubt can't argue with that in terms of sensors yeah so
00:15:16 yes maybe sensors right so like there's there's an example that we all go do it have many of us everyday in terms of
00:15:29 latter being a crutch sure but but you know in the same way that you know the combustion engine was a crutch on the
00:15:35 path to an electric vehicle on the same way that you know any technology ultimately gets
00:15:43 replaced by some superior technology in the future and really what with the way that I look at this is that the way we
00:15:51 get around on the ground the way that we use transportation is broken and that we have you know this this you know what
00:15:59 was I think the number I saw this morning 37,000 Americans killed last year on our roads and that's just not
00:16:07 acceptable and so tech any technology that we can bring to bear that accelerates the this techno you know
00:16:13 self-driving technology coming to market and saving lives is technology we should be using and it feels just arbitrary to
00:16:24 say well you know I'm I'm not okay with using lasers because that's whatever but I am okay with using an 8 megapixel
00:16:32 camera or a 16 megapixel camera you know like it's just these are just bits of technology and we should be taking the
00:16:37 best technology from the tool bin that allows us to go and you know and solve a problem the question I often talk to
00:16:47 well obviously you do as well to sort of automotive companies and you know if there's one word that comes up more
00:16:53 often than anything is costs and and trying to drive cost down so while it's it's true that it's a tragic number the
00:17:03 37,000 the the question is what and I'm not the one asking these questions I hate this question but yeah we want to
00:17:11 find the cheapest sensor suite that the creates a safe vehicle so in that uncomfortable trade-off do you foresee
00:17:22 lidar coming down in cost in the future or do you see a day where level for autonomy is possible without lighter I
00:17:31 see both of those but it's really a matter of time and I think really maybe the I would talk to the question you
00:17:37 asked about you know the cheapest set certainly I don't think that's actually what you want what you want is a sensor
00:17:45 suite that is economically viable and then after that everything is about margin and driving cost out of the
00:17:53 system what you also want is a sense suite that were and so it's great to tell a story about
00:18:01 how you know how it'd be better to have a self-driving system with a $50 sensor instead of a you know a $500 dancer but
00:18:10 if the $500 sensor makes it work and the $50 sensor doesn't work you know who cares the longest you can actually you
00:18:20 have an economic offer you know there's an economic opportunity there and the economic opportunity is important
00:18:26 because that's how you actually have a sustainable business and that's how you can actually see this come to scale and
00:18:33 and and be out in the world and so when I look at lidar I see a technology that has no underlying fundamentally you know
00:18:42 expense to it fundamental expense to it it's it's going to be more expensive than an imager because you know CMOS
00:18:51 processes or you know fab processes are dramatically more scalable than mechanical processes but we still should
00:18:58 be able to drive cost out substantially on that side and then I also do think that with the right business model you
00:19:08 can absorb more you know certainly more cost on the Bill of Materials yeah if the sense of sweetie works extra values
00:19:13 provided thereby you don't need to drive costs down to zero it's the basic economics you've talked about your
00:19:20 intuition that level to autonomy is problematic because of the human factor of vigilance that command complacency
00:19:29 over trust and so on just us being human yeah we trust the system we start doing even more so partaking in the secondary
00:19:37 activities like smart phone and so on have your views evolved on this point in either direction can you can you speak
00:19:47 to it so and I want to be really careful because sometimes this gets twist in a way that's that that I
00:19:55 certainly didn't intend so active safety systems are a really important technology that we should be pursuing
00:20:03 and integrating into vehicles and there's an opportunity in the near term to reduce accidents reduce fatalities
00:20:10 and that's and we should be we should be pushing on that level two systems are systems where the vehicle is controlling
00:20:21 two axes so in breaking and braking and throttle / steering and I think there are variants of level two systems that
00:20:29 are supporting the driver that absolutely like we should we should encourage to be out there where I think
00:20:37 there's a real challenge is in the the human factors part around this and the misconception from the public around the
00:20:45 capability set that that enables and the trust they should have in it and that is where I you know I kind of I am actually
00:20:54 incremental II more you know concerned around level three systems and you know how exactly a level two system is
00:21:00 marketed and delivered and you know how people how much effort people have put into those human factors so I still
00:21:07 believe several things around this one is people will over trust the technology we've seen over the last few weeks you
00:21:14 know a spate of people sleeping in their Tesla you know I watched an episode last night of Trevor Noah
00:21:25 talking about this and you know him you know this is a smart guy who's has a lot of resources at his disposal describing
00:21:33 a Tesla's a self-driving car and that why shouldn't people be sleeping in their Tesla there's like well because
00:21:39 it's not a self-driving car and it is not intended to be and you know these people will almost certainly you know
00:21:49 die at some point or hurt other people and so we need to really be thoughtful about how that technology is described
00:21:57 and brought to market I also think that because of the economic issue you know Iike my economic challenges we
00:22:02 were just talking about that that technology path will ugly these level two driver assistance
00:22:08 systems that technology path will diverge from the technology path that we need to be on to actually deliver truly
00:22:17 self-driving vehicles ones where you can get it and sleep and have the equivalent or better safety then you know a human
00:22:25 driver behind the wheel because the again the economics are very different in those two worlds and so that leads to
00:22:32 you know divergent technology so you just don't see the economics of gradually increasing from level two and
00:22:41 doing so quickly enough to where it doesn't cost safety critical safety concerns you believe that the it needs
00:22:48 to diverge at this point in two different basically different routes and really that comes back to what are those
00:22:57 l2 and l1 systems doing and and they are driver systems functions where the the the people that are marketing that
00:23:06 responsibly are being very clear and putting human factors in place such that the driver is actually responsible for
00:23:13 the vehicle and that the technology is there to support the driver and the safety cases that are built around those
00:23:22 or dependence on that driver attention and attentiveness and at that point you you can kind of give up
00:23:31 to some degree for economic reasons you can give up on safe false negatives and so and the way to think about this is
00:23:38 for a for collision mitigation braking system if it half the times the driver missed a vehicle in front of it it hit
00:23:46 the brakes and brought the vehicle to a stop that would be an incredible incredible advance and in safety on our
00:23:53 roads right that would be equivalent to seatbelts but it would mean that if that vehicle wasn't being monitored it would
00:24:01 hit one out of two cars and so economically that's a perfectly good solution for a driver assistance system
00:24:07 what you should do at that point if you can get it to work 50 percent of the time is drive the cost out of that so
00:24:12 you can get it on as many vehicles as possible but driving the cost out of it doesn't drive up performance on the
00:24:19 false negative case and so you'll continue to not have a technology that could you know really be available for
00:24:27 for a self driven vehicle so clearly the communication and this probably applies though for vehicles as well the
00:24:34 marketing and a communication of what the technology is actually capable of how hard it is how easy it is all that
00:24:41 kind of stuff is highly problematic so but it's say everybody in the world was perfectly communicated and were made to
00:24:49 be completely aware of every single technology out there what they what it's able to do what's your intuition and now
00:24:56 maybe getting into philosophical ground is it possible to have a level 2 vehicle where we don't over trust it I don't
00:25:07 think so if people truly understood the risks and internalized it then then sure you could do that safely but that that's
00:25:16 a world that doesn't exist that people are going to they're gonna you know if the facts are put in front of them
00:25:22 they're gonna then combine that with their experience and you know let's say they're they're using an l2 system and
00:25:30 they go up and down the 101 every day and they do that for a month and it just worked every day for a month like that's
00:25:38 pretty compelling at that point you know just even if you know the statistics like well
00:25:43 I don't know maybe there's something funny about those maybe they're you know driving in difficult places like I've
00:25:49 seen it with my own eyes it works and the problem is that that sample size that they have so it's 30 miles up but
00:25:57 now so 60 miles times 30 days so 60 180 a thousand eight hundred miles that's that's a drop in the bucket compared to
00:26:05 the one you know what eighty-five million miles between fatalities and so they don't really have a true estimate
00:26:12 based on their personal experience of the real risks but they're gonna trust it anyway because it's hard not to work
00:26:17 for a month West what's gonna change so even if you start at perfect understanding of the
00:26:23 system your own experience will make it drift and that's a big concern you know over a year over two years even it
00:26:30 doesn't have to be months and I think that as this technology moves from what I say it's kind of the more technology
00:26:39 savvy ownership group to you know the mass market you may be able to have some of those folks who are really familiar
00:26:46 with technology they may be able to internalize it better and you know you're kind of immunization against this
00:26:53 kind of false risk assessment might last longer but as folks who are who aren't as savvy about that you know read the
00:27:01 material and they compare that to their personal experience I think there that you know it's it's going to it's gonna
00:27:09 move more quickly so your work the program that you've created a Google and now at Aurora is focused more on the
00:27:18 second path of creating full autonomy so it's such a fascinating I think it's one of the most interesting AI problems of
00:27:27 the century right it's a I just talked to a lot of people just regular people I don't know my mom about autonomous
00:27:33 vehicles and you begin to grapple with ideas of giving your life control over to a machine is philosophically
00:27:41 interesting it's practically interesting so let's talk about safety how do you think we demonstrate you spoken about
00:27:49 metrics in the past how do you think we demonstrate to the world that an autonomous vehicle an Aurora system is safe
00:27:57 this is one where it's difficult because there isn't a soundbite answer that we have to show a combination of work that
00:28:08 was done diligently and thoughtfully and this is where something like a functional safety process as part of
00:28:13 that is like here's here's the way we did the work that means that we were very thorough so you know if you believe
00:28:20 that we what we said about this is the way we did it then you can have some confidence that we were thorough in in
00:28:25 in the engineering work we put into the system and then on top of that the you know to kind of demonstrate that we
00:28:32 weren't just thorough we were actually good at what we did there'll be a kind of a collection of evidence in terms of
00:28:40 demonstrating that the capabilities work the way we thought they did you know statistically and and to whatever degree
00:28:48 we can we can demonstrate that both in some combination of simulations some combination of unit testing and
00:28:55 decomposition testing and then some part of it will be on Road data and and I think the the way we will ultimately
00:29:04 convey this to the public is they'll be clearly some conversation with the public about it but we'll you know kind
00:29:11 of invoke the the kind of the trusted nodes and that will spend more time being able to go into more depth with
00:29:18 folks like like nitsa and other federal and state regulatory bodies and kind of given that they are operating in the
00:29:26 public interest and they're trusted that if we can you know show enough work to them that they're convinced then you
00:29:32 know I think we're in a in a pretty good place that means you work with people that are essentially experts at safety to try to
00:29:40 discuss and show do you think the answer is probably no but just in case do you think there exists a metric so currently
00:29:46 people have been using number of disengagement yeah and it quickly turns into a marketing scheme to just sort of
00:29:53 you alter the experiments you run to adjust I think you've spoken that you don't like no Mohammed no in fact I I
00:29:59 was on the record telling DMV that I thought this was not a great metric do you think it's possible to create a
00:30:08 metric a number that that could demonstrate safety outside of fatalities so so I I do and I think that it won't
00:30:19 be just one number so as we are internally grappling with us and at some point we'll be we'll be able to talk
00:30:25 more publicly about it is how do we think about human performance in different tasks say detecting traffic
00:30:35 lights or safely making a left turn across traffic and what do we think the failure rates are for those different
00:30:43 capabilities for people and then demonstrating to ourselves and then ultimately folks the regulatory role and
00:30:51 and then ultimately the public that we have confidence that our system will work better than that and so these these
00:30:58 individual metrics will can tell a compelling story ultimately I do think at the end of the day what we care about
00:31:09 in terms of safety is life saved and injuries reduced and then and then ultimately you know kind of casualty dollars
00:31:18 that people aren't having to pay to get their car fixed and I do think that you can you know we in aviation they look at
00:31:26 a kind of an event pyramid where you know a crash is at the top of that and that's the worst event obviously and
00:31:32 then there's injuries and you know near-miss events and whatnot and and you know violation of operating procedures
00:31:39 and and you kind of build a statistical model of the relevance of the low severity things to the high spirit of
00:31:46 things I think that's something where we'll be able to look at as well because you know an event per 85 million miles
00:31:54 that you know statistically a difficult thing even at the scale of the u.s. to to to kind of compare directly and that
00:32:02 event the fatality that's connected to an autonomous vehicle is significantly at least currently magnified in the
00:32:12 amount of attention and yet so that speaks to public perception I think the most popular topic about autonomous
00:32:21 vehicles in the public is the trolley problem formulation right which has let's not get into that too much but is
00:32:30 misguided but in many ways but it speaks to the fact that people are grappling with this idea of giving control over to
00:32:39 a machine so how do you win the hearts and minds of the people that autonomy is something that could be a part of their
00:32:46 lives thank you let them experience it alright I think it's I think I think it's right I think people should be
00:32:54 skeptical I think people should ask questions I think they should doubt because this is something new and different
00:33:02 they haven't touched it yet and I think it's perfectly reasonable and but at the same time it's clear there's an
00:33:09 opportunity to make the roads safer it's clear that we can improve access to mobility it's clear that we can reduce
00:33:17 the cost of mobility and that once people try that and are you know understand that it's safe and are able
00:33:24 to use in their daily lives I think it's one of these things that will will just be obvious and I've seen this practically
00:33:33 in you know demonstrations that I've you know given where I've had people come in and you know they're very skeptical they
00:33:40 again in a vehicle you know my favorite one is taking somebody out on the freeway and we're on the 101 driving at
00:33:45 65 miles an hour and after ten minutes they they kind of turn and ask is that all it does and
00:33:52 you're like yeah it's self-driving car not sure exactly which I thought it would be right but they you know they it
00:33:59 becomes mundane which is which is exactly what you want a technology like this to be right we don't really when I
00:34:07 turn the light switch on in here I don't think about the complexity of you know the those electrons you know being
00:34:13 pushed down a wire from wherever it was and being generated it's not like it's just it's like I just get annoyed if it
00:34:20 doesn't work right and and what I value is the fact that I can do other things in this space I can you know see my
00:34:26 colleagues I can read stuff on a paper I can you know not be afraid of the dark and I think that's what we want this
00:34:34 technology to be like is it's it's in the background and people get to have those those life experiences and and do
00:34:38 so safely so putting this technology in the hands of people speaks to scale the deployment
00:34:49 all right so what do you think the the dreaded question about the future because nobody can predict the future
00:34:57 yeah but just maybe speak poetically about when do you think we'll see a large-scale deployment of autonomous
00:35:05 vehicles ten thousand those kinds of numbers you will see that within ten years I'm pretty confident we what's an
00:35:18 impressive scale what moment so you've done DARPA Challenger there's one vehicle at which moment does it become
00:35:25 wow this is serious scale so so I think the moment it gets serious is when we really do have driverless vehicle
00:35:35 operating on public roads and that we can do that kind of continuously without a safety dry without a safety driver in
00:35:41 the vehicle I think at that moment we've we've kind of crossed the zero to one throw shoulde and then it is about how do we
00:35:52 continue to scale that how do we build the right business models how do we build the right customer experience
00:35:57 around it so that it is actually you know a useful product out in the world and I think that is really at that point
00:36:06 it moves from a you know what is this kind of mixed science engineering project into engineering and
00:36:14 commercialization and really starting to deliver on the value that we all see here and you know actually making that
00:36:21 real in the world what do you think that deployment looks like where do we first see the inkling of no safety driver one
00:36:29 or two cars here and there is it on the highway is it in specific roads in the urban environment I think it's going to
00:36:38 be urban suburban type environments you know with a roar when we we thought about how to tackle this I is kind of
00:36:45 enfoque to think about trucking as opposed to urban driving and and you know the again the human intuition
00:36:54 around this is that freeways are easier to drive on because everybody's kind of going in the same direction and you know
00:37:02 lanes are wider etc and I think that that intuition is pretty good except we don't really care about most of the time
00:37:08 we we care about all of the time and when you're driving on a freeway with a truck say 70 70 miles an hour and you've
00:37:16 got 70,000 pound load with you that's just an incredible amount of kinetic energy and so when that goes wrong it
00:37:25 goes really wrong and that those those challenges that you see occur more rarely so you don't get to learn as all
00:37:31 as quickly and there you know incrementally more difficult than urban driving but they're not easier than
00:37:38 urban driving and so I think this happens in moderate speed urban environments because they're you know if
00:37:46 if two vehicles crash at 25 miles per hour it's not good but probably everybody walks away
00:37:52 those those events where there's the possibility for that occurring happened frequently so we get to learn more
00:37:59 rapidly we get to do that with lower risk for everyone and then we can deliver value to people that they need
00:38:05 to get from one place to another and then once we've got that solved then the kind of the freeway driving part of this
00:38:12 just falls out but we were able to learn it's more safely more quickly in the urban environment so ten years and then
00:38:18 scale twenty thirty year I mean who knows if if it's sufficiently compelling experience is created it can be faster
00:38:26 and slower do you think there could be breakthroughs and what kind of break throughs might there be that completely
00:38:33 changed that timeline again not only am I asked to predict the future oh yeah I'm asking you to predict breakthroughs
00:38:38 that haven't happened yet so what's the I think another way to ask that was would be if I could wave a magic wand
00:38:45 what part of the system would I make work today to accelerate it as quick as don't say infrastructure please don't
00:38:54 say infrastruc no it's definitely not infrastructure it's really that car that perception forecasting capability so if
00:39:04 if tomorrow you could give me a perfect model of what's happened what is happening and what will happen for the
00:39:11 next five seconds around a vehicle on the roadway that would accelerate things pretty dramatically how you in terms of
00:39:18 staying up at night are you mostly bothered by cars pedestrians or cyclists so I I worry most about the vulnerable
00:39:26 road users about the combination of cyclists and cars right just because I khlyst and pedestrians because you know
00:39:33 they're not in armor you know with the cars they're bigger they've got protection for the people
00:39:38 and so the ultimate risk is is lower there whereas a pedestrian or cyclist they're out in the road you know they they don't
00:39:47 have any protection and so you know we need to pay extra attention to that do you think about a very difficult
00:39:56 technical challenge of the fact that pedestrians if you try to protect pedestrians by being careful and slow
00:40:04 they'll take advantage of that so the game theoretic dance yeah does that worry you of how from a technical
00:40:12 perspective how we solve that because as humans the way we solve that it's kind of nudge our way through the pedestrians
00:40:19 which doesn't feel from a technical perspective as a appropriate algorithm but do you think about how we solve that
00:40:27 problem yeah I think I think there's there's I think that was actually there's two different concepts there so
00:40:35 one is am I worried that because these vehicles are self-driving people kind of step in the road and take advantage of
00:40:42 them and I've heard this and I don't really believe it because if I'm driving down the road and somebody steps in
00:40:49 front of me I'm going to stop right like a even if I'm annoyed I'm not going to just drive through a person stood on the
00:40:59 road right and so I think today people can take advantage of this and you and you do see some people do it I guess
00:41:04 there's an incremental risk because maybe they have lower confidence that I'm going to see them than they might
00:41:09 have for an automated vehicle and so maybe that shifts it a little bit I think people don't want to get hit by
00:41:16 cars and so I think that I'm not that worried about people walking out of the 101 and you know creating chaos more
00:41:25 than they would today regarding kind of the nudging through a big stream of pedestrians leaving a concert or
00:41:31 something I think that is further down the technology pipeline I think that you're right that's tricky I don't think
00:41:40 it's necessarily I think the algorithm people use for this is pretty simple Yeah right it's kind of just move
00:41:45 forward slowly and if somebody's really close and stop and and I think that that probably can be replicated pretty pretty
00:41:54 easily and particularly given that it's you don't do this at 30 miles an hour you do it at one that even in those
00:42:00 situations the risk is relatively minimal but I you know it's not something we're thinking about in any
00:42:06 serious way and probably the that's less an algorithm problem or creating a human experience so they see AI people that
00:42:14 create a visual display that you're pleasantly as a pedestrian nudged out of the way yes that's a that's a yeah
00:42:21 that's an experienced problem not an algorithm problem who's the main competitor to Arora today and how do you
00:42:28 out-compete them in the long run so we really focus a lot of what we're doing here I think that you know I've said
00:42:36 this a few times that this is a huge difficult problem and it's great that a bunch of companies are tackling it
00:42:41 because I think it's so important for society that somebody gets there so we you know we're we don't spend a whole
00:42:50 lot of time like thinking tactically about who's out there and and how do we beat that that that person individually
00:42:57 what are we trying to do to go faster ultimately well part of it is the leadership team we have has got pretty
00:43:05 tremendous experience and so we kind of understand the landscape and understand where the coldest acts are to some
00:43:10 degree and you know we try and avoid those I think there's a part of it just this great team we've built people this
00:43:19 is a technology and a company that people believe in the mission of and so it allows us to attract just awesome
00:43:27 people to go work we've got a culture I think that people appreciate that allows them to focus allows them to really
00:43:33 spend time solving problems and I think that keeps them energized and then we've invested hard invested heavily in the
00:43:44 infrastructure and architectures that we think will ultimately accelerate us so because of the folks were able to bring
00:43:51 in early on because the the the great investors we have you know we don't spend all of our time doing demos and
00:43:58 kind of leaping from one demo to the next we've been given the freedom to invest in
00:44:05 infrastructure to do machine learning infrastructure to pull data from our on-road testing infrastructure to use
00:44:11 that to accelerate engineering and I think that that early investment and continuing investment and those kind of
00:44:18 tools will ultimately allow us to accelerate and do something pretty incredible Chris beautifully put
