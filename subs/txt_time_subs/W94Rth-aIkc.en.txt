00:00:02 you could say i've talked about continents fairly regularly on this channel and if you've really been paying
00:00:07 attention i'd say you're familiar with the fact that people can't seem to agree on how many of these the earth
00:00:14 actually has in school i was taught that there were one two three four five six seven though
00:00:19 some of you might have been taught that there's a six or six and some people on youtube sure
00:00:24 seem to like talking about an eighth but i think the big takeaway from all of this
00:00:30 is that the term continent is rather vague and any way we decide to divvy up land will always be a little arbitrary
00:00:37 but if that leaves you a little unsatisfied don't worry you're in good company which is why in search for a
00:00:42 more definitive answer to what's ultimately an unanswerable question some people have turned to
00:00:48 plate tectonics which is just kind of a mess what with all these little weird plates in between the big ones and so on
00:00:54 others have done even worse and tried to use cultures in doing so giving themselves the impossible task
00:01:00 of drawing straight lines through the murky divisions between groups of people and then there are some
00:01:05 absolute fools who will say screw it let's just start from scratch and see where we get
00:01:11 and yet here we are no closer to any sort of definitive answer and honestly maybe even a little
00:01:15 bit more confused but okay what if we did something really crazy and say looked at the distribution
00:01:21 of plants and animals across the world to see if there's any way to define continents
00:01:25 through their native biology well it just so happens that my biogeography
00:01:42 now lucky for us someone has already gone through the trouble of dividing the world into seven biogeographic
00:01:48 realms many of which line up nicely to our preconceived notions of continents unlucky for us in order to
00:01:54 actually understand why these are the way that they are we can't just look at how things are today
00:01:59 but rather we need to look much further back in time to see how past biology and past geography shaped our present biogeography
00:02:08 or in other words we first need a lesson in paleobiogeography so buckle up while life has been found
00:02:15 on this planet for over 3 billion years we only need to look back 200 million years to a time when all the
00:02:20 continents of the world had come together into a single super continent pangaea this is an ideal
00:02:27 time and place for us to start because having all major land masses physically connected allowed both plant and animal species to
00:02:34 freely and completely disperse across any lands they found suitable briefly creating an
00:02:40 original all-encompassing realm the pangea under which all terrestrial life was included
00:02:46 while the biology of the pangea realm may have looked vastly different from what we're used to today
00:02:51 it would be from this initial melting pot of a gene pool that all subsequent terrestrial life would delineate from
00:02:58 the most recent common ancestor so to speak this era of interconnectedness came to an end as the tethos seaway began
00:03:05 widening splitting the supercontinent into two roughly equal land masses larasia and
00:03:12 gondwana sending the biota of each new continent off on their own unique evolutionary trajectory
00:03:18 contained within larasia was north america europe and well most of asia while gondwana was a conglomerate of
00:03:24 south america africa india australia oh yeah and antarctica from this point on the populations
00:03:31 between the two continents effectively couldn't mix allowing for two distinct biogeographic realms to emerge
00:03:39 the arctic and the tropic being centered at a much higher latitude laresia was periodically exposed to
00:03:46 much lower average temperatures placing an evolutionary pressure on the plants and animals here to develop cold hardy
00:03:51 bodies or else offered extinction to any species that couldn't keep itself
00:03:57 warm a good example of how this pressure manifested itself would be in the pine genus or as the fancy scientists would
00:04:04 call the penis genus having evolved on larasia some 130 million years ago pine trees quickly
00:04:10 distributed themselves across the continent which is why even if we look at a modern distribution
00:04:15 map for pine trees we'll see they still exhibit a luration distribution only growing in lands that once belonged
00:04:22 to the arctic realm this environmental stress also affected animals making cold-blooded species less capable
00:04:30 of surviving here while consequently giving warm-blooded animals like mammals the advantage
00:04:35 this explains why it was here that the planet witnessed a huge diversification of mammals into the laresha theria a whole
00:04:43 branch of mammals specific to lurasia which consists of many of the animals we're most familiar with today
00:04:49 included in this development was perisodactyla or odd-toed undulates like horses donkeys tapers and rhinoceros
00:04:56 artiodactilla or the even toad on gillette which holy crap includes even more popular animals like
00:05:01 all camellids pigs ruminants like giraffes deers antelopes cattle sheep goats etc all the way to hippopotamus
00:05:07 and even cetaceans rodintia which yeah are all rodents and carnivorous which can be further divided
00:05:14 into feline and canine try to figure out what kinds of animals fit into those categories however just like its predecessor as
00:05:20 laresia aged it too began to break apart with the central atlantic rift cutting a line between
00:05:25 europe and greenland effectively splitting the arctic realm in two
00:05:31 on one side the pale arctic the paleo in reference to this being considered by many to be part of the old world
00:05:37 on the other side the new arctic or the new world arctic altogether the shared natural history of
00:05:43 these two realms explains why basically all flora and fauna across north america has a direct analog to be found across
00:05:50 eurasia and vice versa this similarity in biology was only reinforced with the periodic
00:05:56 reconnection of asia to north america across the bering strait allowing further exchange between
00:06:03 these seemingly distant lands okay so that's two out of the seven biogeographic realms meaning that the
00:06:08 remaining five all came from the breakup of gondwana having stayed as a whole much closer to
00:06:15 the warmth of the equator evolution on gondwana took its own path one that was less influenced by temperature
00:06:21 resulting in a flora and fauna better adapted to tropical climates hence the title tropic for this realm
00:06:27 and so just like how the laresia the area developed on eurasia here the gondwanath area began
00:06:32 to emerge as well notably it was around 70 million years ago that the first
00:06:38 true primates evolved to somewhere in the center of africa by this time gondwana had already
00:06:43 begun splitting apart meaning primates weren't able to fully distribute themselves and instead were only able to reach
00:06:50 south america and india this explains why the modern distribution of primates minus humans of course looks
00:06:56 like this reflecting a late gondwanan dispersal as gondwana broke up even further so too did the tropical realm
00:07:03 south america and africa became the largest fragments causing the gondwanatheria to diverge into the xenarthra
00:07:10 and the afrotheria signifying the two continents becoming their own distinct biogeographical realms in the process
00:07:17 the neotropic and the afrotropic from an assortment of common ancestors south america ended up with animals like
00:07:22 the sloth anteaters and the armadillo while the afrotheria became things like aardvorks
00:07:28 hydraxes and tinrics without any of the arctic megafauna this left room for larger
00:07:35 herbivores to emerge from these groups so in south america common sloths were free to speciate into the enormous ground
00:07:43 and aquatic sloths anteaters became well giant anteaters and the armadillo family diversified into glyptodonts
00:07:50 in africa the same thing happened where a relative of the hyrax started growing bigger and bigger losing
00:07:55 most of its hair while its nose got much longer giving birth to the order probasa dia the only surviving member of which
00:08:00 being the elephant at one point a relative of the elephant even began living aquatically
00:08:07 first staying within the shallows presumably using its trunk as a sort of snorkel but eventually fully adapted to
00:08:12 the water and speciated into cyrenia becoming dugongs and manatees
00:08:18 africa however never fully escaped the reach of lurasia having reconnected with asia approximately 30 million years ago
00:08:25 this opened up the two lands for exchange with many of the larasian mammals coming down into africa filling
00:08:31 the continent with even and odd towed ungulates felines and canines and so on relatives of the elephants also managed
00:08:37 to make their way into the paley arctic adapting to the cold conditions by growing bigger and regrowing thick fur
00:08:44 resulting in mammoths mastodons stegodantidae and moetherium by using the bering land bridge these species
00:08:51 were even able to enter the knee arctic realm explaining how a genus originating in africa made it all the way to north america
00:08:59 overall due to its more recent connection to eurasia the north of africa has largely been colonized by
00:09:05 species of the pale arctic so much so in fact that it is now included as part of that
00:09:10 realm as many of the species we associate most with africa lions rhinos zebras giraffes hyenas all
00:09:16 got their evolutionary start in the arctic realm the afrotropic was still partially
00:09:22 preserved however thanks to the sahara desert retaining its primates and most of its plant species and even produced
00:09:28 us humans which as we all know went out from the afrotropic to extensively colonize every other realm on earth south america
00:09:35 on the other hand remained isolated from about 80 million years ago until about 20 million years ago when
00:09:40 the panamanian land bridge began to reach out from north america to join the two continents together
00:09:46 this kickstarted what's known as the great american interchange a mixing of endemic species that continues to this day
00:09:54 this wasn't a fair and equal fusion however as i already mentioned prior to this recombination north america has
00:10:00 been sporadically reconnected to asia through the bering land bridge this not only brought the new arctic and
00:10:06 the paley arctic realms temporarily back together but later this also meant african and indian influences reached
00:10:12 all the way to north america the effect of this was that only the most competitive animals prevailed across
00:10:18 these related realms stacking the knee arctic with far more robust species when compared to
00:10:24 those hosted in neo-tropical isolation and so when these two realms collided many of the unique and specially adapted
00:10:31 species of south america were replaced by the more generalist species of the north incoming undulates like camellids
00:10:37 entered and evolved into llamas and alpacas felines came here to diversify into jaguars and cougars and even rodentia
00:10:45 spread from north to south growing to sizes never before attained by rodents like capybaras and
00:10:51 maras all the while helping to push native animals like a ground sloths and glyptodonts into extinction but this is
00:10:58 also where the lines really start to blur as plants don't exactly follow the same rules as animals so while knee arctic animals
00:11:06 were more successful overall at invading the neotropic the tropical climate of central america gave
00:11:12 a localized edge to advancing neo-tropical plants the result of which being plant communities
00:11:19 of south american origin coming to dominate all the way up to mexico where both the climate and therefore the flora
00:11:25 begins transitioning to new arctic an interesting effect of this is that even though new arctic animals may be more
00:11:31 widely adaptable in terms of animals especially adapted for tropical rainforests those of the neotropic still
00:11:39 reign supreme allowing other neotropical animals to infiltrate deeper into north america and pushing the line of the
00:11:44 neotropic as far north as the central american rainforests would reach
00:11:49 overall this makes the whole of mesoamerica a tremendous transitional zone filling countries like mexico with
00:11:55 some of the most diverse collections of flora and fauna to be found anywhere in the world a similar process
00:12:02 of recombining realms can be found when looking at india you see india broke from gondwana
00:12:08 approximately 130 million years ago and spent 80 million years adrift in the middle of what would become the
00:12:14 indian ocean similar to south america this isolation bred a very unique biota and soon enough a distinct
00:12:21 indian realm came about one derived from the greater tropical realm primates especially had a field day
00:12:27 having come about only 70 million years ago their only route to colonizing india would have been a random rafting event
00:12:33 meaning it was likely only a single primate species that found its way aboard this leaving ship
00:12:40 but over the next 50 million years this common ancestor would come to diversify into a number of species what would
00:12:45 become gibbons macaques and langers this isolation didn't last however and around 50 million years ago
00:12:53 india came into contact with southern asia opening up a new arena for pale arctic and index species to interchange
00:13:00 the only difference here is that while yes mixing did occur the arrival of india also led to the building of the
00:13:05 himalayas which served as the world's biggest barrier for traversing plants and
00:13:12 animals while these mountains shielded most of india preserving much of the indian realm
00:13:16 an opening was left going through southeastern asia leading to a fusion of indian and malayan species
00:13:24 the result being the modern day realm of indo-malaya this is all made slightly more complicated by the fact that only a few
00:13:31 thousand years ago lower sea levels brought much more of the melee archipelago above the ocean forming the sunderland
00:13:38 this opened an avenue for indo-malayan flora and fauna to expand as far as this shelf reached and remain here even after
00:13:45 rising sea levels turned much of the region back into scattered islands why the indo-malayan realm doesn't
00:13:51 include all of these islands however has to do with australia also once belonging to
00:13:57 gondwana a joint australia and antarctica broke apart from the supercontinent at roughly the same time
00:14:02 that india did the two southern continents remained attached in isolation for another 40
00:14:08 million years together forging a new australic realm rewind a bit and it was approximately
00:14:13 100 million years ago that the first marsupials evolved in modern-day north america from here they migrated south possibly
00:14:20 using the caribbean islands to colonize south america while subsequently going extinct further north
00:14:25 south america remained attached to antarctica by its southern tip until around 30 million years ago giving
00:14:32 marsupials a pathway to expand further but it was also around this time that the southeast indian ridge started
00:14:37 breaking the continents apart literally sending antarctica to the shadow realm while australia got lucky
00:14:42 and pushed further northward right in the middle of this about 50 million years ago when the two
00:14:47 landmasses weren't too far removed yet a single marsupial managed to raft over to
00:14:54 australia where it found a land devoid of most other mammals on account of the continent's isolation without any
00:15:01 mammalian competition marsupials had finally found the one place where they could become the dominant animals of the realm
00:15:07 this dominance allowed these single ancestral species to diversify into a variety of forms and
00:15:14 functions with herbivores like kangaroos koalas and wombats and carnivores like quals tasmanian devils
00:15:20 and thylacines the australic realm of course included a lot more different animals but hey it's
00:15:25 easier to talk about specific examples than to mention every single living thing that found its way here
00:15:30 but as time went on the australian landmass went through some changes losing zealandia while building up mass
00:15:36 towards its front that would become new guinea as well as surrounding islands these islands would come to share in the
00:15:43 biology of australia in the process forming the australasian realm but as these land masses pushed further
00:15:49 and further north they eventually came into close proximity with the indonesian islands and by extension the
00:15:55 indo-malayan realm so despite on a surface level appearing to be part of the same archipelago there
00:16:00 are in fact two distinct groups of islands here separated by every biogeographer's favorite
00:16:06 line the wallace line defining the border between indo-malaya and australasia of course as we should
00:16:12 all know by now there are no straight or clear lines in nature and as a result of their
00:16:17 proximity a new interchange has kick-started between the two realms as plants and animals crossed the narrow
00:16:23 waterways between islands blending species from both realms together okay that's it right we're done oh yeah
00:16:29 and then there was antarctica i'm pretty sure we all know how this one ends so i'll try to make this fast
00:16:35 despite starting as the southernmost component of gondwana for the longest time antarctica was a highly habitable
00:16:40 land and enjoyed a golden age brought about by the global greenhouse climate of the
00:16:44 earth at the time during this period it would have closely resembled neighboring australia which
00:16:50 stayed connected until about 100 million years ago finding its spot at the south pole by around 80 million years ago
00:16:57 even at the bottom of the planet antarctica remained warm enough for life to thrive for another 30
00:17:02 million years or so in this time antarctica's biology likely diverged substantially from gondwanan and even
00:17:09 australian biology to the point where a new biogeographic realm was realized the antarctic realm but as we
00:17:16 all know the planet began to cool as it entered a new ice age just 3 million years ago and nowhere on
00:17:22 earth was affected more by this change than antarctica year after year temperatures steadily
00:17:27 dropped soon enough ice began to build up and didn't stop building until the whole continent was
00:17:33 under literal miles of ice extinguishing virtually all native antarctic life in the process
00:17:39 putting the wide scale extinction aside though the true shame of this is that all the fossils left behind now lay
00:17:44 buried under miles of ice meaning whatever unique biology that could have developed here before
00:17:49 the freeze remains utterly hidden and unknowable to us now leaving antarctica's paleobiology as a huge
00:17:56 blind spot within the field altogether this leaves the earth with one two three
00:18:02 four five six seven distinct terrestrial realms well actually i didn't want to bring this up in the beginning but there's
00:18:07 actually a little bit of an eighth realm and no it's not zealandia but it's actually not that far off either
00:18:14 you see if you watched my earth's lost land masses video you'll know that the pacific ocean is the site of a lot of
00:18:19 new land building processes both as a result of tectonic uplifts and continuous volcanism constructing
00:18:26 islands entirely independent of all other lands on earth with no natural history to draw from
00:18:33 each newly created island must build their own distinct flora and faunas from whatever seeds birds or the tides may bring over
00:18:42 being situated within the pacific ocean which covers a third of the planet's surface means the islands of the pacific
00:18:48 are perfectly situated to receive inputs from nearly all of the biogeographic realms save for
00:18:52 the afrotropic what's been created is a fascinating laboratory where
00:18:57 all sorts of different combinations between realms can take place producing a unique array of biology on
00:19:04 every single island if this wide range of potential inputs wasn't enough once these castaway
00:19:10 species reached their final island destinations from here they set off on their very
00:19:15 own journey of evolutionary exploration one that's defined by whatever peculiar environmental conditions are harbored therein
00:19:23 in turn it is these island dwellers that are most active in seeding whatever new islands might arise within the pacific
00:19:29 volcanic arena what this all means is that while this prismatic gene pool makes it impossible
00:19:35 to generalize the oceanic realm it nonetheless constitutes in and of itself a distinct biota connected
00:19:41 through a disconnection to any others universal in its uncategorized ability
00:19:48 hawaii is a fascinating case study of all of these principles at work not only does the hawaiian island chain
00:19:53 represent the largest islands within the realm but also some of the most isolated being 3 700 kilometers from the
00:20:01 nearest continental lands of california part of the new york deck 5300 kilometers from pale arctic lands 8 500
00:20:09 kilometers from the indomalangan realm 6400 kilometers from australasia and 8400 kilometers from the neotropic
00:20:17 despite being located closest to north america prevailing ocean currents lead the waters of the northern pacific to
00:20:23 circulate counter-clockwise acting as a conveyor belt delivering material from all over the ocean to
00:20:28 these islands this explains why when analyzing the plant species present and
00:20:34 deciphering their realm of origin it was found that indo-malaya was the greatest source of native hawaiian plant species
00:20:39 having supplied 21 percent of hawaiian flora despite being the furthest away
00:20:45 the new arctic was the second most influential that's unsurprising supplying 19 percent
00:20:51 what's really interesting however is just how much was contributed by other areas east asia was next
00:20:57 contributing 17 of native hawaiian species the neotropic supplied 12 and even 9 percent originated from
00:21:04 far away australasia if you're following along and doing the math in your head you'll
00:21:09 find that there's still about 22 percent of the hawaiian gene pool that's unaccounted for
00:21:13 and this is truly where the eighth biogeographic realm comes into play as all of the islands of the pacific
00:21:19 also receive influx from all of the other islands of the pacific and it's estimated that an additional 11
00:21:25 percent of the hawaiian gene pool comes from other pacific islands this leaves a final 11
00:21:32 of native hawaiian species with unknown origins because while figuring out the natural history of things like this can be
00:21:37 extremely tricky but consider this in the last 400 000 years a new island has begun forming off
00:21:45 the southeastern edge of hawaii forming the loewy high seamount while luihai remains 975 meters
00:21:52 under water today with an average growth rate of 5 meters per millennia at some point over the next 200 000
00:22:00 years a new island will breach above the ocean once this occurs sure louie high will receive inputs from all around the
00:22:05 pacific but the most immediate donor will of course be the other hawaiian islands
00:22:11 what this appears to suggest is a chain of donation from one island to the next in perpetuity and looking at how far
00:22:17 back the hawaiian islands stretch we begin to see the potential for a lineage passed
00:22:23 down from island to island to island all the way to the present it's possible that this inherited
00:22:29 hawaiian biota may in fact be the source of the remaining unidentified 11 percent of species
00:22:34 native to the islands altogether what i hope this has shown is that the islands of the pacific
00:22:40 share an ineffable quality that make them unlike anywhere else on earth uniting them into a single patchwork
00:22:46 realm oceania and so there you have it that's the seven or eight realms of biogeography
00:22:53 so what do you think is this a better way to divide and talk about our world compared to the six or seven or eight
00:22:58 continents or are you still unconvinced well either way let me know by leaving a comment and
