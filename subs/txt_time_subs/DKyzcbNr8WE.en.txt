00:00:01 the following is a conversation with john hopfield professor Princeton whose life's work weave beautifully through
00:00:10 biology chemistry neuroscience and physics most crucially he saw the messy world of biology through the piercing
00:00:19 eyes of a physicist he's perhaps best known for his work on associative neural networks now known as hopfield networks
00:00:26 that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed the development of the modern field of deep learning as his 2019
00:00:34 Franklin medal in physics award States he applied concepts of theoretical physics to provide new insights and
00:00:41 important biological questions in a variety of areas including genetics and neuroscience was significant impact on
00:00:49 machine learning and as John says in his 2018 article titled now what his accomplishments have often come about by
00:00:59 asking that very question now what and often responding by a major change of direction this is the artificial intelligence

00:02:37 biological neural networks and artificial neural networks is most captivating and profound to you at the
00:02:47 higher philosophical level let's not get technical just yet one of the things very much intrigues me is the fact that
00:02:59 neurons have all kinds of components properties to them and evolutionary biology if you have some little quirk
00:03:10 and I even how a molecule works or how it still works and it can may mean use of evolution will sharpen it up and make
00:03:18 it into a useful feature rather than a glitch and so you expect in neurobiology for evolution to have captured all kinds
00:03:29 of possibilities of getting neurons of how you get neurons to do things for you and that aspect has been completely
00:03:39 suppressed in artificial neural networks so the glitches become features in them in the biological neural network they
00:03:49 they can look let me take one of the things that I used to do research on if you take things which oscillate their
00:04:01 rhythms which are sort of close to each other under some circumstances these things will have a phase transition and
00:04:08 suddenly is the rhythm will everybody will fall into step there was a marvelous physical example of that in
00:04:16 the millenium bridge across the Thames River about Bill about 2001 and pedestrians walking across pedestrians
00:04:26 don't walk synchronized they don't walk and lock lockstep but they're all walking about the same frequency and the
00:04:33 bridge could say at that frequency in the slight sway made pedestrians tend a little bit to lock in the step master
00:04:40 well the bridge was oscillating back and forth and the pedestrians were walking in step to it you could see
00:04:47 we made it at the bridge and the engineers made a simple-minded a mistake they had a feeling when you walk it's
00:04:55 step step step and it's back at forth motion but when you walk it's also right foot left foot side to side motion and
00:05:02 the side to side motion for which the bridge was strong enough but it wasn't it wasn't stiff enough and as a result
00:05:11 you would feel the motion and you'd fall under step with it and people were very uncomfortable with it they closed the
00:05:17 bridge for two years really fully built stiffening for it no nerves look nerve cells loose action potentials you have a
00:05:25 bunch of cells which are loosely coupled together perusing action potentials of the same rate there'll be some
00:05:32 circumstances under which these things can lock together other circumstances which they won't
00:05:41 well they fire together you can be sure the other cells are going to notice it so you could make a computational
00:05:47 feature out of this and you're in an evolving brain most artificial neural networks don't even have action
00:05:55 potentials let alone have the Potala bility for synchronizing them and you mentioned the evolutionary process so
00:06:04 they're the evolutionary process that builds on top of biological systems leverage is that the the weird mess of
00:06:16 it somehow so how do you make sense of that ability to leverage all the different kinds of complexities in the
00:06:26 biological brain well look in the part of the biological molecule level you have a piece of DNA which included an
00:06:35 encode for a particular protein you could duplicate that piece of DNA and now one part of it
00:06:42 encode for that protein but the other one could itself change a little bit and the start coding for a molecule which is
00:06:48 just slightly different now is that molecule was just slightly different had it in a function which helped any old
00:06:57 chemical reaction was as important to the cell you would go ahead and let that e try an
00:07:05 evolution of slowly and improve that function and so you have the possibility of duplicating and then having things
00:07:15 drift apart one of them retain the old function the other one do something new for you
00:07:22 and there's evolutionary pressure to improve look there isn't computers to adjust improvement has to do with
00:07:30 closing some companies openings others the evolutionary process looks a little different yeah oh similar timescale
00:07:39 perhaps well or shorter in times to kill companies close yeah go bankrupt and are born yeah shorter but not much shorter
00:07:48 some some company lasts the century a couple but yeah you're right I mean if you think of companies a single organism
00:07:55 that builds and you all know yeah it's a fascinating dual correspondence there between biological and companies have
00:08:05 difficulty having a new product competing with an old fraud large yeah and when IBM built this first PC you
00:08:15 probably read the dread the book they made a little isolated internal unit to make the PC and for the first time in
00:08:23 IBM's history they didn't insist that you build it out of IBM components but they understood that they could get into
00:08:32 this market which is a very different thing by completely changing their culture and biology finds other markets
00:08:46 in a more adaptive way he adds better at it it's better at that kind of integration so maybe you've already said
00:08:54 it but what to use the most beautiful is it the adaptive the ability to adapt as you've described there's there some
00:09:08 other little quirk that you particularly like adaptation is everything when you get down to it but the difference there
00:09:21 are differences between adaptation where your learning goes on on the over generation that over evolutionary time
00:09:29 or your learning goes on at the timescale of one individual who must learn from the environment during that
00:09:40 individuals lifetime and biology has both kinds of learning in it and the thing which makes neurobiology hard is
00:09:52 that a mathematical systems that were built on this other kind of evolutionary system what do you mean by mathematical
00:10:02 system where where's the math in the biology well when you talk to a computer scientist about neural networks it's all
00:10:10 math the fact that biology actually came about from evolution the thing and the fact that biology is about a system
00:10:28 if you look at computer chips computer chips are basically two dimensional structures a 2.1 dimensions but they
00:10:36 really have difficulty doing three-dimensional wiring biology biology is the neocortex is actually also
00:10:46 sheet-like and it sits on top of the white matter which is about ten times the volume of the gray matter and
00:10:52 contains all what you might call the wires but there's a huge the the effect the effect of computer structure on what
00:11:07 is easy and what is hard is immense so and biology does makes some things easy that are very difficult to
00:11:17 understand how to do computationally on the other hand you can't do simple floating-point arithmetic because though
00:11:23 it's awfully stupid yeah and you're saying this kind of three dimensional complicated structure makes
00:11:32 it's still math it still doing math the kind of math is doing enables you to solve problems of a very different kind
00:11:39 that's right that's right so you mentioned two kinds of adaptation the evolutionary adaptation at the end
00:11:48 the adaptation are learning at the scale of a single human life which do you are which is particularly beautiful to you
00:11:59 and interesting from a research and from just a human perspective and which is more powerful
00:12:07 I find things most interesting that I begin to see how to get into the edges edges of them and tease them apart a
00:12:17 little bit see how they work and since I can't see the evolutionary process going on I am in awe of it but I find it just
00:12:30 a black hole as far as trying to understand what to do and so in a certain sense I'm a doll but I couldn't
00:12:38 be interested in working on it the human life timescale is however thing you can tease apart and study yeah
00:12:50 you can do there's developmental neurobiology which understands all of these connections and now the structure
00:13:01 evolves from a combination of what the genetics is like and the real the fact that this is you're building a system in
00:13:11 three dimensions in just days and months those early early days of human life are really interesting they are and of
00:13:22 course there are times of immense still multiplication there are also times of the craziest cell death in the brain is
00:13:34 during infancy it's turnover so what is what what what is not effective which is not wired well enough to use the moment
00:13:44 throw it out it's a mysterious process from let me ask from what field do you think the biggest breakthroughs in
00:13:53 understanding the mind will come in the next decades is it neural science computer science
00:14:03 neurobiology psychology physics maybe math maybe literature well of course I see the world always
00:14:13 through a lens of physics I grew up in physics and the way I pick problems is very characteristic of physics and of an
00:14:24 intellectual background which is not psychology which is not chemistry and so on and so on
00:14:30 at both the air parents of physicists both of our parents were physicists and the real thing I gathered that was a
00:14:38 feeling that the world is an understandable place and if you do enough experiments and think about what
00:14:48 they mean and structure things that you can do the mathematics of the relevant of the experiments you also be able to
00:14:56 understand how things work but that was that was a few years ago did you change your mind at all through many decades of
00:15:05 trying to understand the mind of studying in different kinds of ways not even the minds just biological systems
00:15:12 you still have hope the physics that you can understand there's the question of what do you mean by understand of course
00:15:23 when I taught freshman physics I used to say I wanted to get physics to understand the subject to understand new
00:15:30 this laws I didn't want them simply to memorize a set of examples to which they knew the equations to write down to
00:15:39 generate the answers I had this nebulous idea of understanding so the if you looked at a situation you can say oh I
00:15:47 expect the bowl to make that trajectory all right I expect so I'm into a notion of understanding and I don't know how to
00:15:58 express that very well I've never known how to express it well and you run smack up against it well you choose these look
00:16:08 at these simple neural Nets feed-forward neural Nets which do amazing things and yet you know contain nothing of the
00:16:18 essence of what I would have felt was understanding attending is more than just an enormous lookup table let's
00:16:27 linger on that how sure you are of that what if the table gets read Liebig so i'm he asks another way these
00:16:37 feed-forward neural networks do you think they'll ever understand good answer that in two ways I think if
00:16:47 you look at real systems feedback is an essential aspect of how these real systems compute on the other hand if I
00:16:55 have a mathematical system with feedback I know I can unlaid this and do it a part of it but but I have an exponential
00:17:05 expansion and the amount of stuff I have to build if I could resolve the problem that way so feedback is essential so we
00:17:14 can talk even about recurrent recurrence but do you think all the pieces are there to achieve understanding through
00:17:23 these simple mechanisms like back to our original question what is the fundamental is there a fundamental
00:17:29 difference between artificial neural networks and biological or is it just a bunch of surface stuff suppose you ask a
00:17:41 neurosurgeon when does somebody did yeah it'll probably go back to saying well I can look at the brain rhythms and tell
00:17:49 you this is a brain which has never could have functioned again this is one another but this other one is one which
00:17:57 if we treat it well is still recoverable and then just do that by so many electrodes looking at simple like
00:18:06 electrical patterns just don't look in any detail at all or what individual neurons are doing these rhythms are
00:18:18 already absent from anything which goes yeah but the rhythms but the rhythms would so well that's like comparing okay
00:18:34 I'll tell you it's like you're comparing the the greatest classical musician in the world to child first learning to
00:18:42 play the question I'm at but they're still both playing the piano I'm asking is there will it ever go on at Google do
00:18:52 you have a hope because you're one of the seminal figures in both launching both disciplines both sides of the of
00:19:02 the river I think it's going to go on generation after generation the way it has where what you might call the AI
00:19:13 computer science community says let's take the following this is our model of Neurobiology at the moment let's pretend
00:19:21 it's good enough and do everything we can with it and it does interesting things and after the while sort of
00:19:32 grinds into the sand and you say Oh something else is needed from neurobiology and some other grand thing
00:19:40 comes in and enables you to go a lot further according to the sandakan everything it could be generations of
00:19:48 this evolution I don't know how many of them and each one is going to get you further into what a brain does whatever
00:19:57 then in some sense passed the Turing test longer and more broad aspects and how many of these are good there are
00:20:10 going to have to be before you say I've made something I've made a human I don't know but your sense is it might be a
00:20:19 couple my senses might be a couple more yeah and going back to my brain waves of from the AI point of view if they would
00:20:35 say ah maybe these are heavy phenomena and not important at all the first car I had no record of 1936 dodge Kobo 45
00:20:50 miles an hour in the wheels was Jimmy yeah good good speedometer that now don't be designed at the car that
00:21:01 way the cars malfunctioning to have that but in biology if you if it were useful to know when are you going more than 45
00:21:10 miles an hour you just capture that and you wouldn't worry about where it came from yeah it'll be a long time before that
00:21:21 kind of thing which can take place in large complex networks of things is actually used in the computation
00:21:32 look-the how many transistors are there at your laptop these days actually I don't know the number it's it's on a
00:21:39 scale of 10 to the 10 I can't remember the number yeah and all the transistors are
00:21:46 somewhat similar and most physical systems with that many parts all of which are selfs or have collective
00:21:56 properties yes soundly is an error Earthquakes what have you have collective properties wither there are
00:22:05 no collective properties used in artificial neural networks in AI yeah it's very
00:22:15 if biology uses them it's gonna take us two more generations of things to be the perfect people to actually dig in and
00:22:23 see how they are used what they mean see you're very right might have to return several times to neurobiology and try to
00:22:35 make our transistors more messy yo-yo at the same time the simple ones whole concert will conquer big aspects
00:22:46 and I think one of the most biggest surprises to me was how well learning systems buzzer manifesting
00:22:57 non-biological how important they can be actually and you how important how useful they can be in a high so if we
00:23:08 can just take a stroll to some of your work that is incredibly surprising that it works as well as it does that
00:23:17 launched a lot of the recent work with neural networks if we go to what are now called hopfield networks can you tell me
00:23:29 what is associative memory in the mind for the human side let's explore memory for a bit okay what
00:23:37 do you mean by associative memory is oh you have a memory of each of your friends your friend has all kinds of
00:23:45 properties from what they look like is whether voice sounds like to where they went to college where you met them go on
00:23:54 and on what what science papers they've written if I start talking about a five foot ten wiry
00:24:06 cognitive scientist that's got a very bad back it doesn't take very long for you to say are you talking about geoff hinton
00:24:13 I never been I never mentioned the name or anything very particular but somehow a few facts are associated with this
00:24:25 with a particular person enables you to get a hold of the rest of the facts yeah earned or not the dress that was another
00:24:32 subset of them and is this the ability to link things together linked experiences together which goes under
00:24:43 the general name of associative memory and a large part of intelligent behavior is actually just large associative
00:24:52 memories at work as far as I can see what do you think is the mechanism of how it works in the
00:25:02 mind is it is it a mystery to you still do you have Inklings of how this essential thing for cognition works what
00:25:15 I made 35 years ago was of course a crude physics model to show the kayak Chua Li enable you to understand my old
00:25:24 sense of understanding as a physicist because you could say ah I understand why this goes to stable States
00:25:31 it's like things going down downhill right and that gives you something with which to think in physical terms rather
00:25:42 than only in mathematical terms so you've created these associative artificial well that warp those right
00:25:49 and now if you if you look at what I did I didn't did all describe a system which gracefully learns I described as a
00:26:02 system in which you could understand how things how learning could link things together how very crudely it might learn
00:26:11 one of the things which intrigues me as I reinvestigate that system now to some extent is look I see you I'll see you
00:26:24 every second for the next hour or what have you each each look at you is a little bit
00:26:31 different I don't store all those second-by-second images I don't store 3,000 images I somehow compact this
00:26:47 which can which I can use it doesn't slavishly remember anything in particular but it could PACs the
00:26:53 information in those useful chunks which are somehow it's these chunks which are not just activities of neurons from
00:27:02 bigger things than that which are the real energies which are which are useful which are useful to you
00:27:10 useful distal to you to describe to compress this information present in such a way that if I get the information
00:27:19 comes in just like this again I don't bother about their to rewrite it or efforts to rewrite it simply do not
00:27:27 yield anything because those things are already written and that needs to be not look this up has ever started somewhere
00:27:37 already therapies not something which is much more automatic in the machine hardware right so in the human mind how
00:27:47 complicated is that process do you think so you've created feels weird to be sitting with john hopfield calling them
00:27:56 hot field networks but it is weird yeah but nevertheless that's what everyone calls them so here we are so
00:28:05 that's a simplification that's what a physicists would do you and richard fineman sat down and talked about
00:28:12 associative memory now if you as a if you look at the mind or you can't quite simplify so perfectly do you let me
00:28:23 backtrack just a little bit yep biology is about dynamical systems computers are dynamical systems you can have if you
00:28:37 want to math the bottle biology bottle neurobiology what is the time scale there's a dynamical system in which you
00:28:46 have a fairly fast timescale in which you goes eight the synopsis don't change much during this computation so I'll
00:28:53 think of the synapses fixed and just do the dynamics of the activity or you can say the synapses are changing fast
00:29:02 enough that I have to have the synaptic dynamics working at the same time as the system dynamics in order to understand
00:29:14 most artists if you look at the feed-forward art revisional their own ads they're all done as learning is
00:29:21 first of all I spent some time learning and not performing and I turned off learning and I perform right that's not
00:29:33 biology and so he is there look more deeply at neurobiology even as associative memory I've got to face the
00:29:39 fact that the dynamics of a synapse change is going on all the time and I can't just get by by thing I'll do the
00:29:49 academics of activity with fixed synapses so the the synaptic the dynamics of the synapses is actually
00:29:58 fundamental to the whole system yum yum and there's no there's no there's nothing necessarily separating the time
00:30:05 skills where the time skills can be separate and it's neat for the physicists of the mathematicians point
00:30:12 of view but it's not necessarily true in neurobiology New York you're kind of dancing beautifully between showing a
00:30:22 lot of respect to physics and then also saying that physics cannot quite reach the the complexity of biology so where
00:30:32 do you land or do you continuously dance between the two I continuously dance between them because my whole notion of
00:30:42 understanding is it you can describe to somebody else how something works in ways which are honest and believable and
00:30:52 still not described all the nuts and bolts in detail whether I can describe whether as ten to the 32 molecules
00:31:05 colliding in the atmosphere I can stimulate whether that way or I pick enough machine I'll simulate it
00:31:13 accurately it's no good for understanding but I just want to understand things I want to understand
00:31:20 things in terms of wind patterns hurricanes pressure differentials and so on all things is there
00:31:30 negative and the physicists physicists in me always hopes that biology will have some things which can be said about
00:31:38 it was are both true and for which you don't need all the molecular details of the molecules colliding that's what I
00:31:46 mean from the roots of physics by understanding so what did again sorry but hopfield networks help you
00:31:57 understand what insight to give us about memory about learning they didn't give insights about learning
00:32:08 they gave insights about how things having learned could be expressed how having learned a picture of a picture of
00:32:20 you reminds me of your name that would put it describe a reasonable way of actually doing the learning or only said
00:32:31 if he had previously learned the connections of this kind of pattern would now be able to behave in a
00:32:40 physical way with the day off I put the part of the pattern in here the other pattern of the pet part of the pattern
00:32:46 will complete over here I can understand that physics if the right learning stuff had already been put in and you couldn't
00:32:53 understand why then putting in a picture of somebody else would generate something else over here but it didn't
00:33:00 out under did not have a reasonable description of the learning process but even to forget learning I mean that's
00:33:08 just a powerful concept that sort of forming representations that are useful to be robust you know for error
00:33:19 correction kind of thing so this is kind of what the biology does we're talking about what my paper did was simply
00:33:27 enable you there long there are lots of ways of being robust if you think of it a dividend amical system here you think
00:33:40 of a system where a path is going on and in time and if you think for a computer is a computational path which is going
00:33:48 out in a huge dimensional space of ones and zeros and an error-correcting system is a system which if you get a little
00:33:59 bit off that trajectory will push you back onto that trajectory again till you get to the same answer in spite of the
00:34:05 fact that there were things though that the computation wasn't being ideally done all the way along a line and there
00:34:13 are lots of models for error correction but one of the models for error correction is to say there's a family
00:34:20 that you're following flowing down and if you push a little bit off the valley it's just like water being pushed a
00:34:27 little bit by a rock gets back and follows the course of the river and then basically the analog in the in the
00:34:38 physical system went to enable to just say oh yes error free computation and an associative memory are very much like
00:34:46 like things that I can understand from the point of view of a physical system the physical system is can be under some
00:34:58 circumstances an accurate metaphor it's not the only metaphor there are error correction schemes which don't have a
00:35:07 valley and energy behind them but those are correction schemes such a mathematician may be able to understand
00:35:15 but I don't so there's a the physical metaphor that seems to a it seems to work here that's right that's right so
00:35:25 these kinds of networks actually led to a lot of the work that is going on now and you're on that works artificial
00:35:32 neural network so the follow-on work with restrictive Boltzmann machines and deep belief Nets
00:35:40 followed on from the from these ideas of the hopfield network so what what do you think about this continued progress of
00:35:50 that work towards now ree-ree vigor ated exploration of feed-forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks
00:35:59 in convolutional neural networks and kinds of networks that are helping solve image recognition natural language
00:36:05 processing all that kind of stuff it's always intrigued me one of the most long-lived all the learning systems is the
00:36:15 Boltzmann machine which is intrinsically a feedback network and was the brilliance of in
00:36:25 and Sadowski to understand how to do learning in that and it's still a useful way to understand learning and
00:36:34 understand and the learning that you understand and that has something to do with the way that feed-forward systems
00:36:41 work but it's not always exactly simple to express that intuition but it always amuses me as he Hinton going back to the
00:36:52 will yet again on a form of the which has feedback and interesting probabilities in it this is a lovely
00:37:04 encapsulation of something in computational something computational something both computational and
00:37:14 physical computational and they very much related to feed-forward networks physical in that Boltzmann machine
00:37:23 learning is really learning a set of parameters for physics Hamiltonian or energy function what do you think about
00:37:33 learning in this whole domain do you do you think the aforementioned guy Geoff Hinton all the work there with
00:37:44 backpropagation all the kind of learning that goes on in these networks how do you if we compared to learning in the
00:37:54 brain for example is there echoes of the same kind of power that back propagation reveals about these kinds of recurrent
00:38:02 networks or is it something fundamentally different going on in the brain I don't think the brain is as deep
00:38:17 as the deepest networks go the deepest computer science networks and I do wonder where they're part of that depth
00:38:26 of the computer science networks is necessitated by the fact that the only learning is easily done on a machine is
00:38:36 his feed-forward and so there's the question of to what extent as the biology which has some feed-forward some
00:38:47 feedback been captured by something which is it got many more neurons but much more depth to the neurons
00:38:58 you know so party you wonders if the feedback is actually more essential than the number of neurons or the depth the
00:39:06 the dynamics of the feedback doesn't ever have the feedback look if you don't have if you don't have feedback it's a
00:39:13 little bit like a building a big computer and having running up through one clock cycle and then you can't do
00:39:22 anything do you put you reload something coming in how do you use the fact that there are multiple clocks like how do I
00:39:29 use the fact that you can close your eyes stop listening to me and think about a chessboard for two minutes
00:39:40 without any input whatsoever yeah that memory thing that's fundamentally a feedback kind of mechanism you're going
00:39:50 back to something yes it's hard it's hard it's hard to understand so I don't respect let alone consciousness oh is
00:40:00 that a little own consciousness yes because that's tied up in there too you can't just put that on another shelf
00:40:08 every once in a while like I interested in consciousness and then I go and I've done that for years and ask one of my
00:40:17 betters as it were their view on consciousness there's been interest in collecting them what let's try to take a
00:40:30 brief step into that room well that's Marvin Minsky does you want to consciousness and Marvin said
00:40:39 consciousness is basically overrated it may be an epiphenomenon after all all the things your brain does but your
00:40:48 as they're actually hard computations you do not consciously and there's so much evidence that even the things the
00:41:01 simple things you do you can make decisions you can make committed decisions about them the neurobiology
00:41:08 can say he's now committed he's going to move the hand left before you know it so his view that consciousness is not
00:41:18 that's just like little icing on the cake the real cake is in the subconscious yo-yo subconscious non
00:41:25 conscious non-conscious that's the better word sir there's the it's only the Freud captured the other word yeah
00:41:31 it's that's a confusing word subconscious Nicholas Chater wrote an interesting book I think the saw
00:41:46 delivers the mind is flat flat and in a neural net sense you might have to be a flat is something which is of very broad
00:41:54 they're all know without earlier than the layers in depth or as a deep brain would be many layers and not so broad in
00:42:04 the same sense that if you push Minsky hard enough he would talk V of said consciousness is your effort to explain
00:42:13 to yourself that would you have already done yeah it's the weaving of the narrative around the things that already
00:42:24 been computed for you that's right and then so much of what we do for our memories of events for example if
00:42:35 there's some traumatic event you witness you will have a few facts about it correctly done if somebody asks you
00:42:42 about it you will weave a narrative which is actually much more rich in detail than that based on some anchor
00:42:50 points you have of correct things and and pulling together general knowledge on the other but you will have a
00:42:57 narrative and once you generate that narrative if you are very likely to repeat that
00:43:01 narrative and claim that all the things you have hidden are actually the correct things there was a marvelous example of that in
00:43:15 the Watergate / impeachment era of John Dean John Dean you're too young to know had been the personal lawyer of Dickson
00:43:28 and so John Dean was involved in the cover-up and John Dean ultimately realized the only way to keep himself
00:43:35 out of jail for a long time was actually to tell some of the truths about Nixon and John Dean was a tremendous witness
00:43:44 he would remember these conversations in great detail and very convincingly tail and long afterward some of the some of
00:43:56 the tapes the secret cases were for which these Don was Jean was recalling these conversations were published and
00:44:05 one found out that John Dean had a good but not exceptional memory what he had was an ability to paint vividly and in
00:44:14 some sense accurately the tone of what was going on by the way that's a beautiful description of consciousness
00:44:28 do you mean like where do you stand in your today so perhaps has changed his day to day but where do you stand on the
00:44:38 importance of consciousness in our whole big mess of cognition is it just a little narrative maker or is it actually
00:44:51 fundamental to intelligence that's our that's a very hard one but I asked Francis Crick about consciousness he
00:45:03 launched forward a long monologue about handling the peas yeah and how Mendel knew that there was
00:45:10 something and how biologists understood there was something in inherit which was just very very different and
00:45:19 he is the effect that inherited traits didn't just wash out into a grey but it's this or this and propagated that
00:45:29 that was absolutely fundamentals of biology and it took generations of biologists to understand that there was
00:45:37 genetic and it took another generation or two to understand that genetics came from DNA but there but but but very
00:45:47 shortly after Mendel thinking biologists did realize that there was a deep problem about inheritance any Francis
00:45:57 blood of life would like to have said and that's why I'm we're working unconsciousness but of course he didn't
00:46:04 have any smoking gun in the sense of Mendel and that's the weakness of his physician that he read his his book but
00:46:15 you wrote with Corey bank yeah Christophe go on I find it unconvincing for this first poking gun
00:46:28 reason start going on and collecting views without actually having taken a very strong one myself because I haven't
00:46:35 seen the entry point not seeing the smoking gun and the point of view of physics I don't see the entry point
00:46:42 whereas whereas the neurobiology once they understood the idea of a collective a and evolution of dynamics which could
00:46:51 be described as a clock a collective phenomenon I thought ah there's a point where what I know about physics is so
00:46:59 different from any neurobiologist that I have something that I might be able to contribute and right now there's no way
00:47:06 to grasp at consciousness from a physics perspective from my point of view that's correct and of course people this is
00:47:17 like everybody else do you think very but early about things you have the closely is related question about
00:47:29 physicists will give an offhand answer and then backtrack backtrack backtrack where they realized that the answer they
00:47:36 gave must fundamentally contradict the laws of physics that natura answering questions of freewill and consciousness
00:47:42 naturally lead to contradictions from a physics perspective because it eventually ends up with quantum
00:47:49 mechanics and then you get into that whole mess of trying to understand how much from a physics perspective how much
00:47:59 is determined already predetermined much is already deterministic about our universe there's lots of difference and
00:48:06 if you don't push quite that far you can say essentially all of Neurobiology which is relevant it can be captured by
00:48:15 classical equations of motion right because in my view of the mysteries of the brain are not the mysteries of
00:48:22 quantum mechanics for the mysteries of what can happen when you have a dynamical system driven system with 10
00:48:33 to the 14 parts the bare complexity is something which is if the physical complex systems is at least as badly
00:48:43 understood as the physics of phase coherence and quantum mechanics can we go there for a second you've talked
00:48:52 about attractor networks and just maybe you could say what our attractor networks and more broadly what are
00:48:59 interesting network dynamics that emerge in these or other complex systems you have to be willing to think in a huge
00:49:09 number of dimensions because there's a huge number of dimensions the behavior of a system can be thought of as just
00:49:15 the motion of the point over time in those huge number of adventures right and an attractor network is simply a
00:49:25 network where there is a line and other lines converge on it in time that's the essence of an attractor Network that's
00:49:34 how you need a highly highly dimensional space and the easiest way to get that is to do it in a high dimensional space where
00:49:44 some of these dimensions provide the dissipation which base which a kind of a physical system trajectories can dig our
00:49:54 contract everywhere they have to get tracked in some places and expand in others there was a fundamental classical
00:50:00 theorem most statistical mechanics which goes under the name of liouville's theorem which says you can't contract
00:50:09 everywhere after country if you contract somewhere you were expand somewhere else do you and is in interesting physical
00:50:17 systems you get driven systems where you have a small subsystem which is the interesting part and the rest of the
00:50:24 contraction of an expansion the physicists say it's the entropy flow in this other part of the system but but
00:50:34 basically attract your networks our dynamics funneling downs of you can't be any so if you start somewhere in the
00:50:43 dynamical system you will soon find yourself on a pretty well determined pathway which goes somewhere you start
00:50:48 somewhere else you'll wind up on a different pathway but you don't have just all possible things you have some
00:50:56 defined pathways which are allowed and onto which you will converge and that's the way you make a stable computer and
00:51:02 that's the way you make a stable behavior so in general looking at the physics of the emergent stability in
00:51:15 these not--when networks what are some interesting characteristics that what are some interesting insights from
00:51:23 studying the dynamics of such high dimensional systems most dynamical systems supposed I'm done driven
00:51:30 dynamical systems I driven there are couples I'm out to an energy source and so their dynamics keeps going because
00:51:40 it's coupling to the energy source most of them it's very difficult as all to understand it all with the devil
00:51:46 the dynamical behavior is going to be you have to run it out you have to running there's this there's a subset of
00:51:55 systems which has what was a clean tone to the mathematicians as as the Alpen of function and those systems you can
00:52:05 understand convergent dynamics by saying you're going downhill on something or other and that's what I found without
00:52:14 ever knowing what the alpha naught functions were in the simple model I made in the early eighties was an energy
00:52:21 function so you could understand how you get this channeling I'm as under pathways without having to follow the
00:52:31 dynamics in an infinite detail you started rolling a ball as off of a mountain that's gonna wind up at the
00:52:37 bottom of a valley you know that it's true without actually watching the ball fall roll down there's certain
00:52:46 properties of the system that when you can know that that's right and not all systems behave that way most don't
00:52:56 probably both don't but it provides you with the metaphor for thinking about systems which are stable in the whoo to
00:53:04 have these attractors behave even if you can't find the idly up and a function behind them or an energy function behind
00:53:19 speaking of thought if I had a glint in my eye with excitement and said you know I'm really excited about this something
00:53:27 called deep learning and neural networks and I would like to create an intelligence system and came to you as
00:53:38 an adviser what would you recommend is it a hopeless pursuit she's knew all networks that she thought is it what
00:53:48 kind of mechanism should we explore what kind of ideas should we explore well you look at this as the simple net worth for everyone
00:54:02 networks they don't support multiple hypotheses very well as I have tried to work with very simple systems which do
00:54:11 something which you might consider to be thinking thought has to do with the ability to do mental exploration before
00:54:24 almost they like we were mentioning playing chess visualizing simulating inside your head different outcomes
00:54:35 yellow young and now you could do that as a feed-forward Network because you've pre calculated all kinds of things but I
00:54:43 think the way neurobiology does it hasn't pre calculated everything exactly as parts of a dynamical system in which
00:54:56 you're doing exploration in a way which is there's a creative element like there's an there's that there's there's
00:55:08 a creative element and in a simple-minded neural net you ever a constellation of instances from which
00:55:24 you've learned and if you are within that space you know if a new fan new question is the question within this
00:55:35 space you can actually rely on that system pretty well to come up with a good suggestion for what to do if on the
00:55:44 other hand the query comes from outside the space you have no way of knowing how the system is going to behave there are
00:55:52 no limitations on what could happen and so with the artificial neural network is always very much I have a a population
00:56:02 of examples the test set must be drawn from the equivalent population as the test as examples which are from a
00:56:10 population which is completely different there's no way that you could expect to get the answer right
00:56:19 Meowth and so what they saw outside the distribution that's right that's right and so if you see a ball rolling across
00:56:27 the streets and dusk if there wasn't in your your training set the idea that a child may be coming
00:56:37 close behind that is not going to occur with the neural lab and it is to our there's something in your biology that
00:56:46 allows that yeah there's there's something in the way of what it means to be outside of the of the population of
00:56:54 the training said the probability is that the training set isn't just sort of the set of examples it's there's more to
00:57:04 it than that and it gets back to my own question of where's is it to understand something yeah you know is in a small
00:57:15 tangent you've talked about the value of thinking of deductive reasoning in science versus large data collection so
00:57:25 sort of thinking about the problem but I suppose it's the physics side of you of going back to first principles and
00:57:31 thinking but what do you think is the value of deductive reasoning in in a well look there obviously scientific
00:57:42 questions in which the route to the answer to it come through the analysis cosmology at honest and that that's
00:57:56 never written the kind of problem in which I've had any particular insight though I would say if you look at
00:58:04 cosmology is was one of those if you look at the actual things that Jim Peebles one of this year's don't go
00:58:10 prized for the vision physics ones from a local physics department the kinds of things he's done he's never crunched
00:58:18 large data never never never he's used the encapsulation of the work of others in this regard but I
00:58:31 ultimately boil down to thinking through the problem like what are the principles under which a particular phenomena
00:58:38 operates yeah and look physics is always going to look for ways in which you can describe the system and which rises
00:58:47 above the rises above the details and to the hard died the world biologists biology works because of the details and
00:58:59 physics to the physicists we want an explanation which is right in spite of the details and they will leave
00:59:05 questions which we cannot answer as physicists because the answer cannot be found that way there's a met sure if
00:59:16 you're familiar with the entire field of brain-computer interfaces has become more and more intensely researched and
00:59:25 developed recently especially with companies like neural link what Elon Musk you know I know they've always been
00:59:34 the endres both in things like getting the eyes to be able to control things or getting the thought patterns to be able
00:59:44 to move what had been a they connected limb which is now connected through a computer that's right so in the case of neural
00:59:54 they're doing thousand-plus connections where they're able to do two-way activate and read spikes in your annual
01:00:02 spikes do you have hope for that kind of computer brain interaction in the near or maybe even far future of being able
01:00:14 to expand the ability of the mind of cognition or understand the mind as this was watching things go when I first
01:00:27 became interested in neurobiology most of the practitioners thought you would be able to understand neurobiology by
01:00:34 techniques which allowed you to record only one cell at a time once out yeah people like David Hoople very strongly
01:00:47 reflected that point of view and that's been taken over by a generation a couple of generations later
01:00:55 a set of people who says not until we can record from 10 to the 4 or 10 to the 5 at a time who we actually be able to
01:01:01 understand how the brain actually works and in a general sense I think that's right you have to look you have to begin
01:01:14 to be able to look for the collective modes of the collective operations of things it doesn't rely on this action
01:01:21 potential or death cell it relies on the collective properties of this set of cells connected to this kind of patterns
01:01:29 so on and you're not going to see did the thing what those collective activities are without recording many
01:01:39 cells at once and the question is how many at once what's the threshold and that's the that's the no and and because
01:01:48 we pursued hard in the motor cortex the motor cortex does something which is complex and yet with the problem you're
01:01:56 trying to address is very it's really simple now neurobiology does it in ways the different from the way an engineer would
01:02:07 do it an engineer would put in six highly accurate stepping motors are controlling a limb rather than 2,000
01:02:15 muscle fibers each of which has to be individually controlled so understanding how to do things in a way which is much
01:02:26 more forgiving and much more neural I think would benefit the engineering world the engineering world touch that's
01:02:37 where their pressure sensor or to let very them an array of of a gazillion pressure pressure sensors none of what
01:02:44 you're accurate all of which are perpetually recalibrating themselves so you're saying your hope is your advice
01:02:53 for the engineers of the future is to the embrace the large chaos of a messy error-prone system like those of the
01:03:04 biological systems like that's probably the way to solve some of these I think you'll be able to make better compete
01:03:13 computations last robotics that way than by trying to force things into a into a robotics for joint motors are powerful
01:03:25 and stepping motors are accurate but then the physicists the physicists in you will be lost forever in such systems
01:03:33 because there's no simple fundamentals to exploring systems that are so large and we also you see that yep there's a
01:03:44 lot of physics and the navier-stokes equations the equations of nonlinear hydrodynamics huge amount of physics in
01:03:53 them all the physics of atoms and molecules has been lost but it's been replaced or this other set of equations
01:04:00 which is just as true as the equations of the bottle though those those equations are going to be harder to find
01:04:09 in general biology but the physicist of me says there are probably some equations of there
01:04:15 sort they're out there there they're out there and the physics is going to contribute anything it may contribute to
01:04:22 trying to find out what those equations are and how to capture them from them biology would you say that's one of the
01:04:31 main open problems of our age is to discover those equations yeah if you look at theirs molecules
01:04:44 there's psychological behavior these two are somehow related there are layers of detail they're
01:04:51 layers of collectiveness and to capture several stages on the way up to see how these things that can actually be linked
01:05:05 together so it seems in our universe there's a lot of a lot of elegant equations that can describe the
01:05:12 fundamental way that things behave which is a surprise I mean it's compressible into equations it's simple and beautiful
01:05:20 but there isn't it's still an open question whether that link is equally between molecules and the brain is
01:05:30 equally compressible into elegant equations but your ear sounds some well you're both a physicist and a dreamer
01:05:39 you have a sense that yes I can although I can only dream physics dreams physics shapes there was an interesting book
01:05:47 called Einsteins dreams Forge alternates between chapters on his life and descriptions of the way time might have
01:06:02 been but isn't as linking between these being of course the ideas that Einstein might have had to think about the
01:06:08 essence of time as he was thinking about time so speaking of the essence of time in neurobiology you're one human famous
01:06:19 impactful human but just one human with a brain living the human condition but you're ultimately mortal like all of
01:06:29 us has studying the mind as a mechanism change the way you think about your own mortality it has really because as
01:06:42 particularly as you get older in the body comes apart in various ways I became much more aware of the fact that
01:06:56 what is somebody is contained in the brain and out in the body that you worry about burying and it is to a certain
01:07:09 extent true that for people who write things down equations dreams notepads Diaries fractions of their thought does
01:07:23 continue to live after they're dead and gone after their body is dead and gone and there's a sea change in there going
01:07:35 on in my lifetime between what if my father died when except for the things that you're actually ridden by hymns
01:07:42 that were very few facts about him will have ever been recorded and the number of facts which are recorded about each
01:07:50 and every one of us forever now as far as I can see in the digital world and so the whole question of what is death may
01:08:03 be different for people a generation to go in a generation or through ahead maybe we have become immortal under some
01:08:16 definitions yeah yeah last easy question what is the meaning of life looking back studied the mind a weird descendants of
01:08:33 apes what's the meaning of our existence on this little earth Oh word meeting is interconnected somehow perhaps is there
01:08:56 it's slippery but is there something you despite being slippery can hold long enough to express all I've been amazed
01:09:10 at how hard it is to define the things in a living system in the sense that what a hydrogen atom is pretty much like another
01:09:21 one bacterium is not so much like another like another bacterium even of the same nominal species in fact the
01:09:29 whole notion of what as the species gets a little bit fuzzy and do species exists in the absence of certain classes of
01:09:37 environments and pretty soon one winds up with with the biology which the whole thing is living but whether there's
01:09:47 actually any element of it which by itself would be said to be living is becomes a little bit vague in my mind so
01:09:58 in a sense the idea of meaning is something that's possessed by an individual like a conscious creature and
01:10:06 you're saying that it's all interconnected in some kind of way that there might not even be an individual
01:10:13 we're all kind of this complicated mess of biological systems at all different levels where the human starts and when
01:10:21 the human ends is unclear you know yeah and we're the neurobiology where the oh you say that the your cortex does the
01:10:29 thinking but there's lots of things that are done in the spinal cord and so we say where's the essence of thought it's
01:10:37 just going to be neocortex can't be campy yeah maybe to understand and to build thought you have to build
01:10:46 the universe along with the the neocortex it's all interlinked through the spinal cord John is a huge honor

01:11:38 Friedman and now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from john hopfield in his article titled now what choosing
01:11:47 problems is the primary determinant of what one accomplishes in science i have generally had a relatively short
01:11:54 attention span and science problems thus i have always been on the lookout for more interesting questions either as my
01:12:01 present ones get worked out or as it get classified by me as intractable give him my particular talents he then goes on to
01:12:11 say what I have done in science relies entirely on experimental and theoretical studies by experts I have a great
01:12:18 respect for them especially for those who are willing to attempt communication with soin who is not an expert in the
01:12:26 field I would only add that experts are good at answering questions if you're brash enough ask your own
