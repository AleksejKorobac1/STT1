00:00:14 evolutionary biological and other cross-disciplinary perspectives he has more big impactful papers and
00:00:21 awards than i can list but most importantly he's a kind curious brilliant human being and just someone i really

00:03:56 what to use the most beautiful aspect of the human genome so we got time the first answer is
00:04:06 that the beauty of genomes transcends humanity so it's not just about the human genome
00:04:12 genomes in general are amazingly beautiful and again i'm obviously biased so in my view 
00:04:18 the way that i like to introduce the human genome and the way that i'd like to introduce genomics to my class
00:04:23 is by telling them you know we're not the inventors of the first digital computer we are the descendants of the first
00:04:30 digital computer basically life is digital and that's absolutely beautiful about life the fact that
00:04:37 at every replication step you don't lose any information because that information is digital
00:04:41 if it was analog it was just protein concentrations you'd lose it after a few generations it would just dissolve away
00:04:48 and that's what the ancients didn't understand about inheritance the first person to understand digital
00:04:53 inheritance was mendel of course and his theory in fact stayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years
00:04:59 while darwin was getting famous about natural selection but the missing component was this
00:05:05 digital inheritance the mechanism of evolution that mendel had discovered
00:05:12 so that aspect in my view is the most beautiful aspect but it transcends all of life
00:05:16 and can you elaborate maybe the inheritance part what was the what was the key thing that
00:05:22 the ancients didn't understand so the very theory of inheritance  as discrete units you know throughout
00:05:29 the life of mendel and well after his writing people thought that
00:05:36 his p experiments were just a little fluke that they were just you know a little exception that would
00:05:40 normally not even apply to humans that basically what they saw is this continuum of eye color
00:05:49 this continuum of skin color this continuum of hair color this continuum of height
00:05:54 and all of these continuums did not fit with a discrete type of inheritance that mendel was describing
00:06:00 but what's unique about genomics and what's unique about the genome is really that there are
00:06:04 two copies and that you get a combination of these but for every trait there are dozens of
00:06:10 contributing variables and it was only ronald fisher in the 20th century
00:06:17 that basically recognized that even five mendelian traits would add up to a continuum-like inheritance pattern
00:06:27 and he you know wrote a series of papers that still are very relevant today about sort of this mendelian inheritance
00:06:35 of continuum like traits and i think that that was the missing step in inheritance
00:06:40 so well before the discovery of the structure of dna which is again another amazingly beautiful aspect
00:06:46 the double helix what i like to call the most noble molecule over time is  you know holds within it the
00:06:54 secret of that discrete inheritance but the conceptualization of discrete you know
00:06:59 elements is something that precedes that so even though it's discrete when it  materializes itself
00:07:06 into actual traits that we see it can be continuous it can basically arbitrarily rich and complex
00:07:12 so if you have five genes that contribute to human height and there aren't five there's a thousand
00:07:18 if there's only five genes and you inherit some combination of them and everyone makes you two inches taller
00:07:24 or two inches shorter it'll look like a continuum trait a continuous trait
00:07:30 but instead of five there are thousands and every one of them contributes to less than one millimeter we change in height
00:07:37 more during the day than each of these genetic variants contributes so by the evening you're shorter than
00:07:44 you were you woke up with isn't it weird then that we're not more different than we are why are we all so similar
00:07:52 if there's so much possibility to be different yeah so so there are selective advantages
00:07:58 to being medium if you're extremely tall or extremely short you run into selective disadvantages so
00:08:03 you have trouble breathing you have trouble running you have trouble sitting if you're too tall if you're too
00:08:08 short you might i don't know have other selective pressures are acting against that if you look at
00:08:13 natural history of human population there's actually selection for height in northern europe and selection against
00:08:19 height in southern europe so there might actually be advantages to actually being
00:08:25 not not super tall and if you look across the entire human population you know for many many traits there's a
00:08:31 lot of push towards the middle  balancing selection is you know the usual term
00:08:38 for selection that sort of seeks to not be extreme and to sort of have a combination of alleles
00:08:45 that sort of you know keep recombining and if you look at you know mate selection super super tall people
00:08:52 will not tend to sort of marry super super tall people very often you see these couples that are kind of
00:08:57 compensating for each other and the best predictor of the kids age is very often just take the average of the
00:09:05 two parents and then adjust for sex and boom you get it it's extremely heritable let me ask 
00:09:11 you kind of  took a step back to the genome outside of just humans but is there something that you find beautiful about
00:09:18 the human genome specifically so i think that genome if more people understood the beauty of the human
00:09:26 genome there would be so many fewer wars so much less anger in the world i mean what's really beautiful about the human
00:09:31 genome is really the variation that teaches us both about individuality
00:09:39 and about similarity so any two people on the planet are 99.9 identical
00:09:45 how can you fight with someone who's 99.9 identical to you it's just counterintuitive and yet any two siblings of the same parent
00:09:57 differ in millions of locations so every one of them is basically two to the million unique
00:10:03 from any pair of parents let alone any two random parents on the planet so
00:10:08 that's i think something that teaches us about sort of the nature of humanity in many ways
00:10:14 that every one of us is as unique as any star and way more unique in actually many ways and
00:10:21  yet we're all brothers and sisters and yeah just like stars most of it is just 
00:10:26 fusion  reactions yeah you only have a few parameters to describe stars you know mass size initial size and you
00:10:33 know stage of life whereas for humans it's you know thousands of parameters
00:10:39 scattered across our genome so the other thing that makes humans unique the other things that makes inheritance
00:10:45 unique in humans is that most species inherit things vertically basically instinct
00:10:55 is a huge part of their behavior the way that you know i mean with my kids we've been watching this
00:11:02 nest of birds with two little eggs you know outside our window for the last few months  for the last few weeks as
00:11:09 they've been growing and there's so much behavior that's hard-coded birds don't just learn as they grow they don't you know there's no
00:11:17 culture like a bird that's born in boston will be the same as a bird that's born in california
00:11:25 so there's not as much inheritance of ideas of customs a lot of it is hard-coded in their genome
00:11:31 what's really beautiful about the human genome is that if you take a person from today and you place them back in ancient egypt
00:11:38 or if you take a person from ancient egypt and you place them here today they will grow up
00:11:49 that is not genetics this is the other type of inheritance in humans so on one hand we have genetic inheritance
00:11:56 which is vertical from your parents down on the other hand we have horizontal inheritance which is
00:12:01 the ideas that are built up at every generation are horizontally transmitted and the huge amount of time that we spend
00:12:10 in educating ourselves a concept known as niotini neo for newborn and then tenney for holding so if you look at humans i mean
00:12:19 the little birds they were you know eggs two weeks ago and that now one of them has already flown off
00:12:24 the other one's ready to fly off in two weeks they're ready to just fend for themselves humans
00:12:32 16 years 18 years 24 getting out of college i'm still learning so so that's so fascinating the this
00:12:38 picture of a vertical in the horizontal i when you talk about the horizontal is it in the realm of ideas
00:12:44 exactly okay so it's the actual social interactions and that's exactly right that's exactly right so basically the
00:12:49 concept of neotimi is that you spend acquiring characteristics from your environment
00:12:56 in an extremely malleable state of your brain and the wiring of your brain for a long period of your life compared
00:13:02 to primates we are useless you take any primate at seven weeks
00:13:07 and in human at seven weeks we lose the battle but at eighteen years you know all bets are off like we
00:13:14 basically our brain continues to develop in an extremely malleable form until very late and this is what allows education
00:13:22 this is what allows the person from egypt to do extremely well now and the reason for that is that
00:13:31 the wiring of our brain and the development of that wiring is actually delayed
00:13:37 so you know the longer you delay that the more opportunity you have to pass on knowledge to pass on concepts ideals
00:13:46 ideas from the parents to the child and what's really absolutely beautiful about humans today is that that lateral
00:13:52 transfer of ideas and culture is not just from uncles and aunts and teachers at school
00:13:58 but it's from wikipedia and review articles on the web and thousands of journals that are sort
00:14:03 of putting out information for free and podcasts and videocasts and all of that stuff where you can
00:14:10 basically learn about any topic pretty much everything that would be in any super
00:14:17 advanced textbook in a matter of days instead of having to go to the library of alexandria and sail
00:14:25 there to read three books and then sail for another few days to get to athens and et cetera et cetera so the
00:14:31 democratization of knowledge and the spread the speed of spread of knowledge is what
00:14:37 defines i think the human inheritance pattern so you sound excited about it about it are you also
00:14:44 a little bit afraid or you're more excited by the power of this kind of distributed spread of information so you
00:14:52 put it very kindly that most people are kind of using the internet in  you know looking wikipedia reading
00:14:58 articles reading papers and so on but  if we if we're honest most people online especially when they're younger
00:15:04 probably looking at five second clips on tick tock or whatever the new social network is
00:15:10 are you given this power of horizontal inheritance are you optimistic or a little bit pessimistic
00:15:20 about the this new effect of the internet and democratization of knowledge on our
00:15:28 on our what would you call this this geno like would you would you use the term genome by the way
00:15:34 yeah i think you know we use the genome to talk about dna but very often we say you know i
00:15:39 mean i'm greek so people ask me hey what's in the greek genome and i'm like well yeah what's in the
00:15:43 greek genome is both our genes and also our ideas and our ideals and our culture so the
00:15:48 poetic meaning of the word exactly exactly yeah yeah so i think that um
00:15:57 there's a beauty to the democratization of knowledge the fact that you can reach as many
00:16:01 people as you know any other person on the planet and it's not who you are
00:16:07 it's really your ideas that matter is a beautiful aspect of the internet the i think there's of course a danger of my ignorance
00:16:18 is as important as your expertise the fact that  with this democratization comes the abolishment
00:16:25 of respecting expertise just because you've spent you know 10 000 hours of your life studying
00:16:33 i don't know human brain circuitry why should i trust you i'm just going to make up my own theories and they'll be
00:16:37 just as good as yours it's an attitude that that sort of counteracts the beauty
00:16:43 of the democratization and i think that within our educational system and within the upbringing of our
00:16:50 children we have to not only teach them knowledge but we have to teach them the means
00:16:56 to get to knowledge and that you know it's very similar to sort of you fish you catch a fish for a man for one
00:17:02 day you fed them for one day you teach them how to fish you fed them for the rest of their life
00:17:07 so instead of just gathering the knowledge they need for any one task we can just tell them
00:17:12 all right here's how you google it here's how to figure out what's real and what's not here's how you check the sources
00:17:18 here's how you form a basic opinion for yourself and i think that inquisitive nature is paramount
00:17:27 to being able to sort through this huge wealth of knowledge so you need a basic educational foundation
00:17:35 based on which you can then add on the sort of domain specific knowledge but that basic educational foundation
00:17:40 should just just not just be knowledge but it should also be
00:17:46 epistemology the way to acquire knowledge i'm not sure any of us know how to do that in this modern day we're
00:17:52 actually learning one of the big surprising thing to me about the the coronavirus for example is that
00:17:59 twitter has been one of the best sources of information basically like building your own network
00:18:06 of experts of of  you know as opposed to the traditional centralized expertise of the who and the
00:18:13 cdc and the or or maybe any one particular respectable person at the top of a
00:18:21 department in some kind of institution you instead look at a you know 10 20 hundreds of people
00:18:29 some of whom are young kids with just that are incredibly good at aggregating data and plotting and
00:18:35 visualizing that data that's been really surprising to me i don't know what to make of it
00:18:42 i don't know i don't know how that matures into something stable you know i don't know if you have ideas
00:18:48 like what if you were to try to explain to your kids of how where should you go to learn
00:18:53 about the about coronavirus what would you say it's such a beautiful example and i
00:19:00 think  the current pandemic and the the speed at which the scientific community has moved in the current pandemic i
00:19:06 think exemplifies this horizontal transfer and the speed of horizontal transfer of information
00:19:13 the fact that you know the genome was first sequenced in early january the first sample was
00:19:18 obtained december 29 2019 a week after the publication of the first genome sequence moderna had already
00:19:27 finalized his vaccine design and was moving to production i mean this is  phenomenal the fact that we go from
00:19:35 not knowing what the heck is killing people in wuhan to wow it's starscore v2 and here's the set
00:19:42 of genes here's the genome here's the sequence here the polymorphisms et cetera in the matter of weeks
00:19:49 is phenomenal in that incredible pace of transfer of knowledge there have been many mistakes
00:19:56 so you know some of those mistakes may have been politically motivated our other mistakes may have just been
00:20:00 innocuous errors others may have been misleading the public for the greater good
00:20:05 such as don't wear masks because we don't want the mask to run out i mean that was very silly in my view and
00:20:13 a very big mistake but the the spread of knowledge from the scientific community was phenomenal
00:20:20 and some people will point out to bogus articles that snuck in and made the front page
00:20:24 yeah they did but within 24 hours they were debunked and went out of the front page and i
00:20:29 think that's that's the beauty of science today the fact that it's not oh knowledge is fixed
00:20:36 it's the ability to embrace that nothing is permanent when it comes to knowledge that
00:20:38 everything is the current best hypothesis and the current best model that best fits the current data
00:20:45 and the willingness to be wrong the expectation that we're going to be wrong and the celebration of success based on how long
00:20:52 was i not proven wrong for rather than wow i was exactly right because no one is going to be exactly
00:20:58 right with partial knowledge but the arc towards perfection i think so much more important than
00:21:08 how far you are on your first step and i think that's what sort of the current pandemic has taught us the
00:21:14 fact that yeah no of course we're gonna make mistakes but at least we're going to learn from
00:21:19 those mistakes and become better and learn better and spread information better so
00:21:23 if i were to answer the question of where would you go to learn about coronavirus first textbook
00:21:30 it all starts with a textbook just open up a chapter on virology and how coronaviruses work
00:21:37 then some basic epidemiology and sort of how pandemics have worked in the past what are the basic principles surrounding
00:21:43 these first wave second wave why do they even exist then understanding about growth
00:21:48 understanding about the are not and rt at you know various time points and then understanding the means of
00:21:56 spread how it spreads from person to person then how does it get into your cells from when it gets into the cells what are the
00:22:03 paths that it takes what are the cell types that express the particular h2 receptor how is your
00:22:09 immune system interacting with the virus and once your immune system launches your defense how is that helping
00:22:15 or actually hurting your health what about the cytokine storm what are most people dying from
00:22:21 why are the comorbidities and these risk factors even applying what makes obese people respond more or elderly people respond
00:22:28 more to the virus while kids are completely you know you know very often not even aware that
00:22:36 they're spreading it so the you know i think there's some basic questions that you would start from and then
00:22:45 i'm sorry to say but wikipedia is pretty awesome yeah google is pretty awesome so it used to be a time it used to be a
00:22:51 time maybe five years ago i forget i forget when but people kind of made fun of wikipedia
00:22:57 for being an unreliable source i never quite understood it i thought from the early days it was
00:23:01 pretty reliable or better than a lot of the alternatives but at this point it's kind of like
00:23:08 a solid accessible survey paper on every subject ever the there's an ascertainment bias and a
00:23:14 writing bias so so i think this this is related to sort of people saying oh
00:23:21 so many nature papers are wrong and they're like why would you publish in nature so many nature papers are wrong and
00:23:27 my answer is no no no so many nature papers are scrutinized and just because more of them are being
00:23:33 proven wrong than in other articles is actually evidence that they're actually better papers overall because
00:23:39 they're being scrutinized at a rate much higher than any other journal so if you basically
00:23:46  judge wikipedia by not the initial content by but by the number of revisions
00:23:53 yeah then of course it's going to be the best source of knowledge eventually it's still very superficial you then
00:23:59 have to go into the review papers etc etc but i mean for most scientific project topics it's extremely superficial but it
00:24:08 is quite authoritative because it is the place that everybody likes to criticize you as being wrong you say that it's
00:24:15 superficial on a lot of topics that i'm i've studied a lot of i find it i don't know if superficial is the right
00:24:24 word because superficial kind of implies that it's not correct
00:24:30 no no i don't mean any implication of it not being correct it's just superficial it's basically
00:24:35 only scratching the surface for depth you don't go to wikipedia you go to the review articles but it can be
00:24:41 profound in the way that articles rarely one of the frustrating things to me about like certain computer science like in
00:24:48 the machine learning world articles they they don't as often take the  the bigger picture view you know
00:24:55 there's a it's a kind of data set and you show that it works and you kind of show that
00:24:59 here's an architectural thing that creates an improvement and so on and so forth but you don't say
00:25:05 well like what does this mean for the nature of intelligence for future data sets we haven't even thought about
00:25:11 or if you were trying to implement this like if we took this data set of  a hundred thousand examples and scaled
00:25:18 it to a hundred billion examples with this method like like look at the bigger picture which is what a wikipedia article
00:25:26 would actually try to do which is like what does this mean in the context of computer the broad field of computer
00:25:32 vision or something like that yeah yeah and no i i agree with you completely like but it depends on the topic
00:25:37 i mean for some topics there's been a huge amount of work for other topics it's just a stub
00:25:42 so you know i got it yeah well yeah actually the  which we'll talk on genomics was not
00:25:50 yeah it's great very shallow yeah yeah it's not wrong it's just shallow yeah every time i criticize something i
00:25:56 should feel partly responsible basically if more people from my community went there and edited
00:26:02 it would not be shallow it's just that there's different modes of communication in different fields and in some fields
00:26:09 the experts have embraced wikipedia in other fields it's relegated and perhaps the reason is that
00:26:16 if it was any better to start with people would invest more time but if it's not great to start with then
00:26:22 you need a few initial pioneers who will basically go in and say ah enough we're just going to fix that
00:26:28 and then i think it'll catch on much more so if it's okay before we go on to genomics can we
00:26:35 linger a little bit longer on the beauty of the human genome you've given me a few notes what else
00:26:40 what else do you find beautiful about the human genome so the last aspect of what makes a human
00:26:44 genome unique in addition to the you know similarity and the differences and individuality
00:26:56 is that so very early on people would basically say oh you don't do that experiment in human you have to
00:27:01 learn about that in fly or you have to learn about that in yeast first or in mouse first or in a prime at first
00:27:07 and the human genome was in fact relegated to sort of oh the last place that you
00:27:11 you're going to go to learn something new that has dramatically changed and the reason that changed is human genetics
00:27:21 we are these species in the planet that's the most studied right now it's embarrassing to say that
00:27:27 but this was not the case a few years ago it used to be you know first viruses then
00:27:35 bacteria then yeast then the fruit fly and the worm then the mouse and eventually human was very far last
00:27:44 so it's embarrassing that it took us this long to focus on it or the  it's embarrassing that the model
00:27:50 organisms have been taken over because of the power of human genetics that right now
00:27:55 it's actually simpler to figure out the phenotype of something by mining this massive amount of human data
00:28:03 than by going back to any of the other species and the reason for that is that if you look at the natural variation
00:28:08 that happens in a population of 7 billion you basically have a mutation in almost every nucleotide
00:28:15 so every nucleotide you want to perturb you can go find a living breathing human being and go
00:28:20 test the function of that nucleotide by sort of searching the database and finding that person
00:28:23 wait why is that embarrassing it's a beautiful data set it's embarrassing for the for the model
00:28:30 organism for the flies yeah exactly i i mean do you do you feel on a small tangent is there something of value
00:28:40 in in the genome of a fly and other these model organisms that you miss that we wish we
00:28:47 would have  would be looking at deeper so directed perturbation of course so i think the place where
00:28:53 the the place where humans are still lagging is the fact that in an animal model you can go and say well let me
00:28:58 knock out this gene completely and let me knock out these three genes completely and i said the moment you get
00:29:03 into combinatorics it's something you can't do in the human because there just simply aren't enough humans on the
00:29:08 planet and again let me be honest we haven't sequenced all seven billion people it's not like we have
00:29:13 every mutation but we know that there's a carrier out there so if you look at the trend
00:29:17 with and the speed with which human genetics has progressed we can now find thousands of genes involved
00:29:27 in human cognition in human psychology in the emotions and the feelings that we used to think are
00:29:32 uniquely learned turns out there's a genetic basis to a lot of that so the  you know the
00:29:40 the human genome has continued to elucidate through these studies of genetic variation so many different processes
00:29:48 that we previously thought were you know something that like free will free will is this beautiful concept that
00:29:55 humans have had for a long time you know in the end it's just a bunch of chemical reactions
00:30:00 happening in your brain and the particular abundance of receptors that you have
00:30:06 this day based on what you ate yesterday or that you have been wired with based on you know your parents and your
00:30:12 upbringing etc determines a lot of that quote unquote free will component to
00:30:18 you know sort of narrower and narrower scale you know sort of slices so how much  on that point how
00:30:25 much freedom do you think we have to escape the the constraints of our genome you're making it sound like
00:30:32 more and more we're discovering that our genome is actually has the a lot of the story already encoded into
00:30:39 it how much freedom do we have i  so so let me let me describe what that freedom
00:30:46 would look like that freedom would be my saying oh i'm gonna resist the urge to eat that apple
00:30:54 because i choose not to but there are chemical receptors that made me not resist the urge
00:31:01 to prove my individuality and my free will by resisting the apple so then the next question is well maybe now i'll
00:31:08 resist the urge to resist the apple and i'll go for the chocolate instead to prove my individuality but then
00:31:13 what about those other receptors that you know that that might be all encoded in there
00:31:19 so it's kicking the bucket down the road and basically saying well your choice will may have actually been driven by
00:31:25 other things that you actually are not choosing so that's why it's very hard to answer that question well it's hard to know
00:31:32 what to do with that i mean if  if the if there's not much freedom it's  it's the butterfly effect it's basically
00:31:42 that in the short term you can predict something extremely well by knowing the current state of the system
00:31:50 but a few steps down it's very hard to predict based on the current knowledge is that because the system is truly free
00:31:56 when i look at weather patterns i can predict the next 10 days is it because the weather it has a lot
00:32:01 of freedom and after 10 days it chooses to do something else or is it because in fact the system is fully deterministic
00:32:09 and there's just a slightly different magnetic feel of the earth slightly more energy arriving from the sun a slightly
00:32:14 different spin of the gravitational pull of jupiter that is now causing you know all kinds
00:32:20 of tides and slight deviation of the moon etc maybe all of that can be fully modeled maybe the fact that China  is emitting a
00:32:27 little more carbon today is actually going to affect the weather in you know egypt in three weeks
00:32:33 and all of that could be fully modeled in the same way if you take a complete view of a human being
00:32:40 now you know i model everything about you the question is can i predict your next step probably
00:32:48 but at how far and if it's a little further is that because of stochasticity and sort of chaos
00:32:54 properties of unpredictability of beyond a certain level or was that actually true free will yeah
00:32:59 then yeah so the number of variables might might be so you might need to  build an
00:33:03 entire universe to  to be able to simulate a human and then maybe that human will be fully simulatable
00:33:11 but maybe aspects of free will will exist and where's that free will coming from it's still coming from the same neurons
00:33:16 or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these neurons but again you know it's very difficult empirically
00:33:21 to sort of evaluate where does free will begin and sort of chemical reactions and electric signals and you know and
00:33:28 so on that's on that topic let me ask the most absurd question  that  most mit faculty role their
00:33:35 eyes on but  do what do you think about the simulation hypothesis and the idea that
00:33:40 we live in a simulation okay there's no empirical evidence no it's not absolutely not
00:33:48 not in terms of empirical evidence or not but  in terms of a thought experiment does it help you
00:33:54 think about the universe i mean so if you look at the genome it's encoding a lot of the information that
00:34:00 is required to create some of the beautiful human complexity that we see around us
00:34:05 it's an interesting thought experiment how much you know  parameters do we need to um
00:34:13 have in order to model some you know this full human experience like if we were to build a video game
00:34:19 yeah how hard it would be to build a video game that's like convincing enough and fun enough and you know 
00:34:27 it has consistent laws of physics all that stuff it's not interesting to use the stock
00:34:32 experiment i i mean it's cute but you know it's all comes razor i mean what's what's more
00:34:37 realistic the fact that you're actually a machine or that you're you know a person what's what's
00:34:42 you know the fact that all of my experiences exist inside the chemical molecules that i have
00:34:47 or that somebody's actually you know simulating all that i mean well you did refer to humans as a
00:34:52 digital computer earlier so of course of course but that's not kind of a machine right i know
00:34:59 i know but i i think the probability of all that is nil and let the machines wake me up and just
00:35:09 i challenge your machines they're gonna they're gonna wait a little bit to see what you're gonna do next it's
00:35:14 fun it's fun to watch especially the clever humans what's the difference to you between the way
00:35:22 a computer stores information and  the human genome stores information so you also have roots and your work
00:35:29 would you say you're when you introduce yourself at a bar it depends who i'm talking
00:35:36 would you say it's computational biology do you do you reveal  your
00:35:43 expertise in computers it depends who i'm talking to truly i mean basically if i meet someone
00:35:48 who's in computers i'll say oh i mean professor in computer science if i meet someone who's in engineering i
00:35:53 say computer science and electrical engineering if i meet someone in biology i'll say hey i work in genomics if i meet someone
00:35:59 in medicine i'm like hey i work on you know genetics so you're a fun person to meet at a bar i got you but
00:36:06 so no no but i'm trying to say is that i i don't i mean there's no single attribute that
00:36:10 i will define myself as you know there's a few things i know there's a few things i study there's a
00:36:15 few things i have degrees on and there's a few things that i grant degrees in and
00:36:21 you know i i publish papers across the whole gamut you know the whole spectrum of
00:36:26 computation to biology etc i mean i the complete answer is that i use computer science to understand biology
00:36:37 so i'm a you know i develop methods in ai and machine learning statistics and algorithms etc
00:36:44 but the ultimate goal of my career is to really understand biology if these things don't advance our
00:36:49 understanding of biology i'm not as fascinated by them although there are some
00:36:54 beautiful computational problems by themselves i've sort of made it my mission to apply the power of computer science to truly understand
00:37:06 the human genome health disease you know and then the whole gamut of how our brain works how our body works and
00:37:11 all of that which is so fascinating so the dream there's not an equivalent
00:37:18 sort of  complementary dream of understanding human biology in order to create an
00:37:23 artificial life an artificial brain artificial intelligence that supersedes the
00:37:29 intelligence and the capabilities of us humans it's an interesting question it's a fascinating question so
00:37:37 understanding the human brain is undoubtedly coupled to how do we make better ai
00:37:45 because so much of ai has in fact been inspired by the brain it may have taken 50 years since the early days of neural networks
00:37:53 till we have you know all of these amazing progress that we've seen with 
00:38:02 you know deep belief networks and  you know all of these advances in go and chess in image synthesis and deep vagues
00:38:13 in you name it and but but the underlying architecture is very much inspired by the human brain which actually pauses
00:38:25 why are neural networks performing so well and they perform amazingly well is it because they can simulate
00:38:33 any possible function and the answer is no no they simulate a very small number of functions
00:38:38 is it because they can simulate every possible function in the universe and that's where it gets interesting the
00:38:43 answer is actually yeah a little closer to that and here's where it gets really fun 
00:38:50 if you look at human brain and human cognition it didn't evolve in a vacuum it evolved in a world
00:38:58 with physical constraints like the world that inhabits us it is the world that we inhabit
00:39:06 and if you look at our senses what do they perceive they perceive different you know
00:39:12 parts of the electromagnetic spectrum you know the hearing is just different movements
00:39:17 in air the the touch etc i mean all of these things we've built intuitions
00:39:23 for the physical world that we inhabit and our brains and the brains of all animals evolved for that world and
00:39:32 the ai systems that we have built happen to work well with images of the type that we encounter in the
00:39:38 physical world that we inhabit whereas if you just take noise and you add random signal that doesn't match
00:39:44 anything in our world neural networks will not do as well and that actually basically
00:39:53 has this whole loop around this which is this was designed by studying our own brain which was evolved for our own world and
00:40:00 they happen to do well in our own world and they happen to make the same types of mistakes that humans make
00:40:07 many times and of course you can engineer images by adding just the right amount of you know sort of pixel deviations to
00:40:14 make a zebra look like a bamboo and stuff like that or like a table but ultimately the undoctored images at least
00:40:25 are very often you know mistaken i don't know between muffins and dogs for example in the same way that humans make those
00:40:32 mistakes so it's it's on you know there's no doubt in my view that the more we understand
00:40:39 about the tricks that our human brain has evolved to understand the physical world around
00:40:44 us the more we will be able to bring new computational primitives in our ai systems to again better understand not just the
00:40:52 world around us but maybe even the world inside us and maybe even the computational problems
00:40:58 that arise from new types of data that we haven't been exposed to but are yet inhabiting the same
00:41:03 universe that we live in with a very tiny little subset of functions from all possible mathematical functions
00:41:10 yeah and that small subset of functions all that matters to us humans really that's what makes
00:41:15 it's all that has mattered so far and even within our scientific realm it's all that seems to continue to
00:41:20 matter but i mean i always like to think about our senses and how much of the physical world
00:41:28 around us we perceive and if you look at the ligo experiment over the last
00:41:37 you know year and a half has been all over the news what what did lago do it created a new sense for human beings
00:41:45 a sense that has never been sensed in the history of our planet gravitational waves have been traversing
00:41:52 the earth since its creation a few billion years ago life has evolved senses to sense things
00:42:03 that were never before sensed light was not perceived by early life no one cared and eventually photoreceptors evolved
00:42:14 and you know the ability to sense colors by sort of catching different parts of that electromagnetic spectrum
00:42:22 and hearing evolved and touch evolved etc but no organism evolved a way to sense neutrinos floating through earth or
00:42:30 gravitational waves flowing through earth etc and i find it so beautiful in the
00:42:35 history of not just humanity but life on the planet that we are now able to capture
00:42:41 additional signals from the physical world than we ever knew before and axions for example have been all
00:42:48 over the news in the last few weeks the concept that we can capture and perceive more of that
00:42:55 physical world is as exciting as the fact that we are we were blind to it is traumatizing
00:43:06 before right because that also tells us how you know we're in 2020 picture yourself in 30 20
00:43:14 or in 20 you know what new senses why might we discover is it you know could it be that we're missing
00:43:23 physics that like there's a lot of physics out there that we're just blind to completely oblivious to it
00:43:29 yeah and yet they're permeating us all the time yes it might be right in front of us
00:43:33 so so when you're thinking about premonitions yeah yeah a lot of that is ascertainment bias like yeah every you know every now
00:43:40 and then you're like oh i remember my friend and then my friend doesn't appear and i'll forget that i remember
00:43:45 my friend but every now and then my friend will actually appear i'm like oh my god
00:43:48 i thought about you a minute ago you just called me that's amazing so you know some of that is this but
00:43:53 some of that might be that there are within our brain sensors for waves that we emit
00:44:03 that we're not even aware of and this whole concept of when i hug my children there's such an emotional
00:44:12 transfer there that we don't comprehend i mean sure yeah of course we're all like hardwired for all kinds of
00:44:17 touchy-feely things between parents and kids it's beautiful between partners it's beautiful etc
00:44:24 but then there are intangible aspects of human communication that i don't think it's
00:44:30 unfathomable that our brain has actually evolved ways and sensors for it that we just don't capture we don't
00:44:35 understand the function of the vast majority of our neurons and maybe our brain is already sensing it but even worse
00:44:43 maybe our brain is not sensing it at all and we're in oblivious to this until we build a
00:44:47 machine that suddenly is able to sort of capture so much more of what's happening in the natural world so what you're saying
00:44:52 is we're going physics is going to discover a sensor for love for and maybe maybe dogs are off scale
00:45:01 for that and we've been oh you know we've been oblivious to it the whole time because
00:45:05 we didn't have the right answer yeah and now you're gonna have a little wrist that says oh my god i feel all this love
00:45:09 in the house i see i sense a disturbance in the force all around us and dogs and cats will
00:45:16 have zero none none but let's take a step back to our unfortunately one of the 400 topics
00:45:26 that we had actually planned but to our sad time in 2020 when we only have just a few sensors and  very primitive
00:45:39 early computers so in your you you have a foot in computer science and a floating biology
00:45:46 in your sense how do computers represent information differently than like the genome or
00:45:52 biological systems so first of all let me  let me  correct that no we're in an amazing time in 2020
00:46:02 computer science is totally awesome and physics is totally awesome and we have understood so much of the natural world than ever before
00:46:11 so i am extremely grateful and feeling extremely lucky to be living in the time that we are
00:46:18 because you know first of all who knows when the asteroid will hit and second you know of all times
00:46:27 in humanity this is probably the best time to be a human being and this might actually be the best place to be a human
00:46:33 being so anyway you know for for anyone who loves science this is this is it this is awesome it's a great time
00:46:39 at the same time just a swift comment all i meant is that  if we look several hundred
00:46:44 years from now and we end up somehow not  destroying the  ourselves yeah
00:46:49 people will probably look back at this time in computer science i like to joke very often with my
00:47:03 students that you know we've written so many papers we've published so much we've been cited so much and every
00:47:08 single time i tell my students you know the best is ahead of us what we're working on now is the most
00:47:12 exciting thing i've ever worked on so in a way i do have this sense of
00:47:17 yeah even the papers i wrote 10 years ago they were awesome at the time but i'm so much more excited about where
00:47:23 we're heading now and i don't mean to minimize any of the stuff we've done in the past but you
00:47:27 know there's just this sense of excitement about what you're working on now
00:47:33 that as soon as a paper is submitted it's like ugh it's old like you know i can't talk
00:47:37 about that anymore at the same time you're not you probably are not going to be able to
00:47:42 predict what are the most  impactful papers and ideas when people look back 200 years from now at
00:47:48 your work what would be the most exciting papers and it may very well be not the thing that you expected
00:47:57 or yeah the things you got awards for or you know this might be true in some fields i don't know i feel slightly
00:48:02 differently about it in our field i feel that i kind of know what what are the important ones and there's a very big
00:48:08 difference between what the press picks up on and what's actually fundamentally
00:48:12 important for the field and i think for the fundamentally important ones we kind of have a pretty good idea what they are
00:48:17 and it's hard to sometimes get the press excited about the fundamental advances but you know we we take what we get
00:48:25 and celebrate what we get and sometimes you know one of our papers which was in a minor journal
00:48:30 made the front page of reddit and suddenly had like hundreds of thousands of views
00:48:34 even though it wasn't a minor journal because you know somebody pitched it the right way that it suddenly caught
00:48:39 everybody's attention whereas other papers that are sort of truly fundamental you know we have a
00:48:44 hard time getting the editors even excited about them when so many hundreds of people are
00:48:49 already using the results and building upon them so i do i do appreciate that there's a
00:48:54 discrepancy between the perception and the perceived success and the awards that you get for various
00:49:00 papers but i think that fundamentally and know that you know some people i'm
00:49:05 so so so when you're writing that you're most proud you know you just you trapped yourself
00:49:10 no no no no i mean is there a line of work that you you have a sense
00:49:16  is really powerful that you've done today you've done so much work in so many directions which is interesting
00:49:23 is there something where you you think is quite special i i mean it's like asking me to say
00:49:30 which of my three children i love best exactly so i mean and it's such a give me question that it's so so
00:49:43 difficult not to brag about the awesome work that my team and my students have done and i'll i'll just mention a few of the
00:49:51 top of my head i mean basically there's a few landmark papers that i think have shaped
00:49:58 my scientific path and you know i like to somehow describe it as a linear continuation of one thing
00:50:04 led to another led to another led to another skip skip skip skip skip let me try to start somewhere in the middle
00:50:18 so my first phd paper was  the first comparative analysis of multiple species
00:50:23 so multiple complete genomes so for the first time we we basically con developed the concept of genome-wide
00:50:30 evolutionary signatures the fact that you could look across the entire genome and understand how things evolve
00:50:38 and from these signatures of evolution you could go back and study any one region and say that's
00:50:45 protein coding gene that's an rna gene that's a regulatory motif that's a you know binding site and so
00:50:50 forth so sorry so comparing different different species of the same so so i think human mouse
00:50:57 rat and dog you know they're all animals they're all mammals they're all performing
00:51:02 similar functions with their heart with their brain with their lungs etc etc so there's many functional elements that
00:51:09 make us uniquely mammalian and those mammalian elements are actually conserved
00:51:17 99 of our genome does not code for protein one percent codes for protein the other 99 we frankly didn't know what it does
00:51:26 until we started doing these comparative genomic studies so basically these series of papers in
00:51:31 in my career have basically first developed that concept of evolutionary signatures and
00:51:37 then apply them to yeast apply them to flies apply them to four mammals apply them to 17 fungi apply
00:51:43 them to 12 drosophila species apply them to them 29 mammals and now 200 mammals
00:51:50 so sorry so can we so the evolutionary signatures this seems like a such a fascinating idea 
00:51:56 and we're probably gonna linger in your early phd work for two hours but  what is how can you reveal something
00:52:05 interesting about the genome by looking at the  multiple multiple species
00:52:11 and looking at the evolutionary signatures yeah like so so you basically
00:52:20  align the matching regions so everything evolved from a common ancestor way way back
00:52:25 and mammals evolved from a common ancestor about 60 million years back so after you know the
00:52:34 meteor that killed off the dinosaurs landed a legend near machu picchu we know the crater it didn't allegedly land
00:52:43 that was the aliens okay no just slightly north of machu picchu in the gulf of mexico there's a giant
00:52:49 hole that that meteorite by the way sorry is that  definitive to people have people um
00:52:56 conclusively  figured out what killed the dinosaurs i think so so it was media well you know for volcanic activity
00:53:06 all kinds of other stuff is coinciding but the meteor is pretty unique and we know how terrifying
00:53:14 i wouldn't if i we still have a lot of 20 20 left so if i think no no but think about it this way
00:53:19 so the the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 175 million years we humans have been around for
00:53:30 what less than one million years if you're super generous about what you call humans
00:53:36 and you include gems basically so so  we are just getting warmed up and you know we've ruled the planet much
00:53:43 more ruthlessly than tyrannosaurus rex t-rex had much less of an environmental impact than we did yeah
00:53:52 and if you if you give us another 154 million years you know humans will look very different
00:53:58 if we make it that far so i think dinosaurs basically are much more of life history on earth than
00:54:04 we are in all respects but look at the bright side when they were killed off
00:54:10 another life form emerged mammals and that's that whole the evolutionary  branching that's
00:54:16 happened so you you kind of have  when you have these evolutionary signatures you see is there
00:54:22 basically a map of how the genome changed yeah exactly exactly so now you can go back to this early mammal
00:54:27 that was hiding in caves and you can basically ask what happened after the dinosaurs were wiped out a ton
00:54:33 of evolutionary niches opened up and the mammals started populating all of these niches
00:54:40 and in that diversification there was room for expansion of new types of functions
00:54:48 so some of them populated the air with bats flying a new evolution of light some populated the oceans with dolphins
00:54:57 and whales going off to swim etc but we all are fundamentally mammals
00:55:03 so you can take the genomes of all these species and align them on top of each other and basically create nucleotide resolution
00:55:13 correspondences what my phd work showed is that when you do that when you line up species on top of each other
00:55:18 you can see that within protein coding genes there's a particular pattern of evolution that is dictated
00:55:26 by the level at which evolutionary selection acts if i'm coding for a protein and i change the third codon position of
00:55:35 a triplet that codes for that amino acid the same amino acid will be encoded
00:55:41 so that basically means that any kind of mutation that preserves that translation that is invariant to that ultimate functional assessment
00:55:53 that evolution will give is tolerated so for any function that you're trying to achieve there's a set of sequences that
00:55:58 encode it you can now look at the mapping the you know graph isomorphism if you wish
00:56:07 between all of the possible dna encodings of a particular function and that function and instead of having
00:56:12 just that exact sequence at the protein level you can think of the set of protein
00:56:17 sequences that all fulfill the same function what's evolution doing evolution has two components one
00:56:23 component is random blind and stupid mutation the other component is super smart ruthless
00:56:33 selection that's my mom calling from greece yes i might be a fully grown man did you just cancel the call wow i know
00:56:43 i'm in trouble so so yeah so there's a lot of encoding for the same kind of function yeah so
00:56:57 so you now have this mapping between all of the set of functions that could all encode the same all of the set of
00:57:03 sequences that can all encode the same function what evolutionary signatures does is that it basically looks at the shape
00:57:11 of that distribution of sequences that all encode the same thing and based on that shape
00:57:15 you can basically say ooh proteins have a very different shape than rna structures
00:57:21 than regulator motifs etc so just by scanning a sequence ignoring the sequence and just looking
00:57:26 at the patterns of change i'm like wow this thing is evolving like a protein and that thing is evolving
00:57:33 like a motif and that thing is evolving so that's exactly what we just did for covid so our paper that we posted about our
00:57:38 archive about coronavirus basically took this concept of evolutionary signatures and applied it
00:57:45 on the sarsko v2 genome that is responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic  and comparing it to 44 cerbicovirus
00:57:53 species so this is the beta word did you just use cervical sarbic virus sars related beta
00:58:01 coronavirus  it's a port ponto so that one family of viruses yeah so it was that family by the way we
00:58:06 have 44 species that or 24 species in the fam yeah virus is a clever
00:58:13 no no but but there's just 44 and again we don't call them species in in viruses we call them strange but
00:58:18 anyway there's 44 strains and that's a tiny little subset of you know maybe another 50 strains that are
00:58:24 just far too distantly related most of those only infect bats as the host and a subset of only four or five
00:58:34 have ever infected humans and we basically took all of those and we aligned them
00:58:38 in the same exact way that we've aligned mammals and then we looked at what proteins are you know which of the
00:58:44 currently hypothesized genes for the coronavirus genome are in fact evolving like proteins and which ones
00:58:50 are not and what we found is that orf10 the last little open reading frame the last little gene
00:58:56 in the genome is bogus that's not a protein at all what is it it's an rna structure
00:59:03 that doesn't have a it doesn't get translated into amino acids and that's so it's important to narrow
00:59:10 down to basically discover what's useful and what's not exactly basically what are what is even
00:59:14 the set of genes the other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed is that within or 3a lies a tiny little
00:59:21 additional gene encoded within the other gene so you can translate a dna sequence in three different reading frames
00:59:28 if you start in the first one it's you know atg et cetera if you start on the second it's tgc
00:59:35 etc and with there's a there's a gene within a gene so there's a whole other protein that we
00:59:40 didn't know about that might be super important so we don't even know the building blocks of sarsko v2
00:59:47 so if we want to understand coronavirus biology and eventually find it successfully we need to even have the set of genes
00:59:53 and and these evolutionary signatures that are developed in my phd work we just recently used you know what let's 
00:59:59 let's run with that tangent for a little bit if it's okay  is  can we talk about  the the kovic 19 a little bit more
01:00:10 like how what's your sense about the the genome the proteins the functions that we understand about
01:00:17 covet 19 where do we stand in in your sense what are the big open problems and and also you know you you kind of said it's
01:00:26 important to understand what are the like the the important proteins and so what else does the
01:00:39 comparison of these species tell us what it tells us is how fast are things evolving it tells us about
01:00:46 at what level is the acceleration or deceleration pedal set for every one of these proteins so
01:00:54 the genome has you know 30 some genes some genes evolve super super fast others evolve
01:00:59 super super slow if you look at the polymerase gene that basically replicates the genome that's a super
01:01:04 slow evolving one if you look at the nuclear capsid protein that's also super
01:01:10 slow evolving if you look at the spike one protein this is the part of the spike protein
01:01:15 that actually touches the h2 receptor and then enables the virus to attach to your cells that's the thing that
01:01:22 gives it that that visual yeah the corona look basically the coronal look yeah
01:01:27 so basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus and there's a first part of the protein
01:01:33 s1 which basically attaches to the h2 receptor and then s2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels the fusion of the
01:01:42 membranes and then the incorporation of the viral rna inside our cells which then gets
01:01:50 translated into all of these 30 proteins so the s1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast so if you look at
01:02:00 the stop professor's gas pedal the gas pedal is all the way down or 8 is also evolving super fast and or
01:02:07 six is evolving super fast we have no idea what they do we have some idea but nowhere near what
01:02:12 s1 is so what the isn't that terrifying that s1 is evol that means
01:02:17 that's a really useful function and if it's evolving fast doesn't that mean new strains could be
01:02:22 created or it does something that means that it's searching for how to match how to best match the host
01:02:27 so basically anything in in general in evolution if you look at genomes anything that's contacting
01:02:32 the environment is evolving much faster than anything that's internal and the reason is that
01:02:37 the environment changes so if you look at the evolution of these cervical viruses
01:02:44 the s1 protein has evolved very rapidly because it's attaching to different hosts each time we think of them as bats
01:02:50 but there's thousands of species of bats and to go from one species of bat to another species of bat you have to adjust
01:02:56 one to the new ace2 receptor that you're going to be facing in that new species sorry quick tangent yeah is it
01:03:01 fascinating to you that viruses are doing this i mean it feels like they're this intelligent organism
01:03:09 i mean is it like does that give you pause how incredible it is that they're the the
01:03:15 evolutionary dynamics that you're describing is actually happening and they're freaking out figuring out
01:03:22 how to jump from bass to humans all in this distributed fashion and then most of us don't even say they're alive
01:03:27 or intelligent whatever so intelligence is in the eye of the beholder you know stupid is a stupid dose as
01:03:35 forest gum would say yes and intelligence is as intelligent does so basically if the virus is
01:03:39 finding solutions that we think of as intelligent yeah it's probably intelligent but that's again in the eye of the
01:03:45 beholder do you think viruses are intelligent of course not really no because so incredible so remember
01:03:52 remember when i was talking about the two components of evolution one is the stupid mutation yeah which is
01:03:57 completely blind and the other one is the super smart selection which is ruthless so
01:04:05 it's not viruses who are smart it's this component of evolution that's smart so it's evolution that that sort of
01:04:10 appears smart and how is that happening by huge parallel search across thousands of
01:04:20 you know parallel infections throughout the world right now yes but so to perfect on that so yes so
01:04:25 then the the intelligence is in the mechanism but then  by that argument  viruses
01:04:32 would be more intelligent because there's just more of them so the search they're basically the the
01:04:38 brute force search that's happening with viruses because there's so many more of them
01:04:43 than humans then they're taken as a whole are more intelligent i mean so you don't think it's possible that
01:04:53 i i mean who runs would we even be here with if viruses weren't i mean who runs this thing so
01:05:01 survivors so let me answer yeah let me answer your your question so um
01:05:08 we would not be here if it wasn't for viruses yes and part of the reason is that if you
01:05:13 look at mammalian evolution early on in this mammalian radiation that basically happened after the death
01:05:18 of the dinosaurs is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome
01:05:26 spread throughout our genome and created binding sites for new classes of regulatory proteins
01:05:32 and these binding sites that landed all over our genome are now control elements that basically
01:05:36 control our genes and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry of mammalian genomes so you know
01:05:45 everything's co-evolution and we're working together they just don't care they don't care
01:05:56 another thing oh is the virus trying to kill us no it's not the virus is not trying to kill you it's true
01:06:01 it's not it's actually actively trying to not kill you so when you get infected if you die
01:06:08 palmer i killed him is what the reaction of the virus will be why because that virus won't spread
01:06:13 many people have a misconception of oh viruses are smart or oh viruses are mean they don't care
01:06:20 it like you have to clean yourself of any kind of anthropomorphism out there i don't know oh yes
01:06:28 so there's a there's a sense when taken it's in a eye of the beholder stupid is a stupid does intelligent injustice
01:06:35 intelligence does so if you want to call them intelligent that's fine then because
01:06:40 and the end result is that they're finding amazing solutions right i mean i mean but they're all
01:06:45 they're so dumb about it they're just doing dumb they don't care they're not dumb and they're not interested
01:06:50 they don't care they care the care word is really interesting exactly i mean there could be an argument that they're conscious
01:06:56 they're just dividing they're not they're just dividing they're just a little entity which
01:07:02 happens to be dividing and spreading it does doesn't want to kill us in fact it prefers not to kill us
01:07:08 it just wants to spread and when i say once again i'm anthropomorphizing but it's just that if you have two
01:07:15 versions of a virus one acquires a mutation that spreads more that's going to spread more one acquires
01:07:20 a mutation that's pressed less that's going to be lost yes one acquires a mutation that enters
01:07:24 faster that's going to be kept one requires a mutation that kills you right away it's going to be lost
01:07:31 so over evolutionary time the viruses that spread super well but don't kill the host are the ones
01:07:36 that are going to survive yeah but so you see you brilliantly describe the basic mechanisms of how it
01:07:41 all happens but when you zoom out and you see the  you know the entirety of viruses maybe across
01:07:50 different strains of viruses it seems like a living organism i am in awe of biology i find biology
01:07:59 amazingly beautiful i find the design of the current coronavirus however lethal it is amazingly beautiful
01:08:06 the way that it is encoded the way that it tricks your cells into making 30 proteins from
01:08:12 a single rna human cells don't do that human cells make one protein from each rna molecule they
01:08:20 don't make two they make one we are hardwired to make only one protein from every rna molecule
01:08:26 and yet this virus goes in throws in a single messenger rna just like any messenger rna we have tens
01:08:32 of thousands of messenger rnas in our cells in any one time in every one of our cells it throws in
01:08:37 one rna and that rna is so i'm going to use your word here not my
01:08:43 word intelligent yeah that it hijacks the entire machinery of
01:08:50 your human cell yeah it basically has at the beginning a giant open reading frame
01:08:55 that's a giant protein that gets translated two-thirds of that rna make a single giant protein that single protein
01:09:04 is basically what a human cell would make it's like oh here's a start codon i'm going to start translating here
01:09:08 human cells are kind of dumb i'm sorry again this is not the word that we normally use but
01:09:13 the human cell basically is oh this is an rna it must be mine let me translate and it starts translating it and then
01:09:19 you're in trouble why because that one protein as it's growing gets cleaved into about 20 different peptides
01:09:29 the first peptide and the second peptide start interacting and the third one and the fourth one and they
01:09:37 shut off the ribosome of the whole cell to not translate human rnas anymore so the virus basically hijacks
01:09:48 your cells and it cuts it cleaves every one of your human rnas to basically say to the ribosome don't
01:09:53 translate this one junk don't look at this one junk and it only spares its own rnas
01:10:00 because they have a particular mark that it spares then all of the ribosomes that normally make protein
01:10:06 in your human cells are now only able to translate viral rnas and make more and more and more and more of them
01:10:13 that's the first 20 proteins in fact halfway down about protein 11 between you know 11 and 12
01:10:19 you basically have a translational slippage where the ribosome skips reading frame
01:10:24 and it translates from one reading frame to another reading frame that means that about half of them are going to be
01:10:28 translated from 1 to 11 and the other half are going to be translated from 12 to 16.
01:10:36 wow it's gorgeous and then then you're done then that mrna will never translate elastin proteins but
01:10:42 spike is the one right after that one so how does spike even get translated this positive strand rna virus has a
01:10:49 reverse transcriptase which is an rna-based reverse transcriptase so from the rna on the
01:10:55 positive strand it makes an rna of the negative strand and in between every single one of these
01:11:00 genes these open reading frames there's a little signal aac gca or something like that
01:11:07 that basically loops over to the beginning of the rna and basically instead of sort of having a single
01:11:14 full negative strand or an a it basically has a partial negative strand rna that ends right before the beginning of
01:11:20 that gene and another one that ends right before the beginning of that gene these negative strand rnas now make
01:11:25 positive strand rnas that then look to the human whole cell just like any other
01:11:30 human mrna it's like oh great i'm going to translate that one because it doesn't have the cleaving that the virus has now
01:11:36 put on all your human genes and then you've lost the battle that cell is now only making proteins for the virus
01:11:45 that will then create the spike protein the envelope protein the membrane protein the nucleocapsid protein that
01:11:50 will package up the rna and then sort of create new viral envelopes and these will then be secreted out of
01:11:57 that cell in new little packages that will then infect the rest of the cells and repeat
01:12:01 the whole process beautiful right it's hard not to anthropomorphize it
01:12:08 oh but it's so gorgeous so there is a beauty to it is there is it is it terrifying to you
01:12:15 so this is something that has happened throughout history humans have been nearly wiped out over and over and over
01:12:23 again and yet never fully wiped out so i'm yeah i'm not concerned about the human race i'm not even concerned about
01:12:30 you know the impact on sort of our our survival as a species this is absolutely something i mean you know
01:12:38 human life is so invaluable and every one of us is so invaluable but if you think of it
01:12:42 as sort of is this the end of our species by by no means basically so so let me explain the black death killed what 30 of europe
01:12:56 that has left a tremendous imprint  you know a huge hole a horrendous hole in the genetic makeup of humans
01:13:07 there's been series of wiping out of huge fractions of entire species or just entire species all together
01:13:16 and that has a consequence on the human immune repertoire if you look at how europe was shaped
01:13:26 and how africa was shaped by malaria for example all the individuals that carry a mutation that protected from malaria
01:13:33 were able to survive much more and if you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease and the frequency
01:13:38 of malaria the maps are actually showing the same pattern the same imprint on africa
01:13:44 and that basically led people to hypothesize that the reason why sickle cell disease is so much more frequent
01:13:50 in americans of african descent is because there was selection in africa against malaria leading to sickle cell
01:13:58 because when the cells sickle malaria is not able to you know replicate inside your cells as
01:14:02 well and therefore you protect against that so if you look at human disease all of the genetic associations that we do
01:14:10 with human disease you basically see the imprint of these waves of selection killing off
01:14:18 gazillions of humans and there's so many immune processes that are coming up as
01:14:24 associated with so many different diseases the reason for that is similar to what i was describing earlier where the
01:14:32 outward facing proteins evolve much more rapidly because the environment is always changing but what's really interesting
01:14:38 the human genome is that we have co-opted many of these immune genes to carry out non-immune functions
01:14:44 for example in our brain we use immune cells to cleave off neuronal connections that don't get used
01:14:51 this whole user will lose it we know the mechanism it's microglia the cleave of neuronal synaptic connections that are
01:14:59 just not utilized when you utilize them you mark them in a particular way that basically when the microglia
01:15:06 come tell it don't kill this one it's it's used now and the microwave will go off and kill
01:15:11 once you don't use this is an immune function which is co-opted to do non-immune things
01:15:17 if you look at our adipocytes m1 versus m2 macrophages inside our fat will basically determine whether you're
01:15:23 obese or not and these are again immune cells that are resident and living within these tissues so many disease associations
01:15:34 that we co-opt these kinds of things for incredibly  complicated functions exactly evolution works in
01:15:40 so many different ways which are all beautiful and mysterious it's not intelligent not intelligent
01:15:45 it's in the eye of the beholder but but but the the the point that i'm trying to make is that
01:15:53 if you look at the imprint that kovit will have hopefully it will not be big hopefully
01:15:57 the u.s will get attacked together and stop the virus from spreading further but if it doesn't it's
01:16:03 having an imprint on individuals who have particular genetic repertoires
01:16:08 so if you look at now the genetic associations of blood type and immune function cells etc there's
01:16:15 actually association genetic variation that basically says how much more likely am i or you to die
01:16:21 if we contact the virus and it's it's through these rounds of shaping the human genome that humans have
01:16:27 basically made it so far and  selection is ruthless and it's brutal and it only
01:16:34 comes with a lot of killing but this is the way that viruses and environments have shaped the human
01:16:40 genome basically when you go through periods of famine you select for particular genes and
01:16:44 what's left is not necessarily better it's just whatever survived
01:16:51 and it may have been the surviving one back then not because it was better maybe the ones that ran slower survived
01:16:56 i mean you know again not necessarily better but the surviving ones are basically the ones that then
01:17:03 are shaped for any kind of subsequent evolutionary condition and environmental condition but if you look at
01:17:10 for example obesity obesity was selected for basically the genes that now predisposes to obesity were at two percent frequency
01:17:16 in africa they rose to 44 frequency in europe wow that's fascinating
01:17:21 because you basically went through the ice ages and there was a scarcity of food so you know there was a selection to
01:17:28 being able to store every single calorie you consume eventually environment changes so the better allele
01:17:35 which was the fat storing allele became the worst allele because it's
01:17:40 the fat storing allele it still has the same function so if you look at my genome speaking of
01:17:45 mom calling mom gave me a bad copy of that gene these fto locus
01:17:52 basically has to do with the obesity or the obesity yeah i basically now have a bad copy
01:17:57 from mom that makes me more likely to be obese and i also also have a bad copy from dad that makes
01:18:01 me more likely to be obese i'm homozygous and that's the allele it's still the minor allele but it's at
01:18:09 44 frequency in southeast asia 42 frequency in europe even though it started at 2
01:18:16 it was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago right now it's pretty terrible so the
01:18:23 other concept is that diversity matters if we had a hundred million nuclear physicists living the earth right now
01:18:31 we'd be in trouble you need diversity you need artists and you need musicians and you need mathematicians and you need
01:18:38 you know politicians yes even those and you need like it's not it's not get crazy enough but
01:18:43 so because then if  virus comes along or whatever exactly exactly so no there's two
01:18:47 reasons number one you want diversity and immune repertoire and we have built in diversity
01:18:53 so basically they're they are the most diverse basically if you look at our immune system there's layers and layers
01:18:57 of diversity like the way that you create your cells generates diversity because of the
01:19:04 selection for the vdj recombination that basically eventually leads to a huge number of repertoires
01:19:10 but that's only one small component of diversity the blood type is another one the major histogram
01:19:15 histocompatibility complex the hla alleles are you know another source of diversity so
01:19:21 the immune system of humans is by nature incredibly diverse and that basically leads to resilience
01:19:27 so basically what i'm saying that i don't worry for the human species because we are so diverse immunologically
01:19:35 we are likely to be very resilient against so many different attacks like this current virus so you're saying
01:19:42 natural pandemics may not be something that you're really afraid of because of the diversity in our
01:19:50 genetic makeup what about engineered pandemics do you have fears of us messing with the makeup of viruses or well yeah
01:19:59 let's say with the makeup of viruses to create something that we can't control and we'd be much more destructive
01:20:06 than it would come about naturally remember how we were talking about how smart evolution is
01:20:11 humans are much dumber so you mean like human scientists yeah humans humans just humans overall yeah
01:20:19 but i mean even you know the sort of synthetic biologists you know basically
01:20:27 if you were to create a you know virus like sars that will kill other people you would probably stars
01:20:35 start with stars so whoever you know would like to design such a thing would basically start with stars
01:20:43 tree or at least some relative of stars the source genome for the current virus was something completely different it
01:20:49 was something that has never infected humans no one in their right mind would have started there oh but when you say source
01:20:54 is like the nearest the nearest relative relative he's in a whole other branch
01:21:00 no species of which has ever infected humans in that branch so you know let's put this to rest this
01:21:06 was not designed by someone to kill off the human race so you don't you don't believe it was engineered
01:21:14 the likely yeah the the path to engineering a deadly virus would not come from this strain that got it that was used
01:21:23  moreover there's been various claims of haha this was mixed and matched in lab
01:21:30 because the s1 protein has three different components each of which has a different evolutionary tree
01:21:36 so you know a lot of popular press basically said aha this came from pangolin and this came
01:21:42 from you know all kinds of other species this is what has been happening throughout the coronavirus tree
01:21:48 so basically the s1 protein has been recombining across species all the time remember when i was talking about the
01:21:52 positive strand the negative strands sub genomic rnas these can actually recombine and if you
01:21:57 have two different viruses infecting the same cell they can actually mix and match between
01:22:00 the positive strand and the negative strand and basically create a new hybrid virus with recombination
01:22:06 that now has the s1 from one and the rest of the genome from another and this is something that happens a lot
01:22:10 in s1 you know fade etc and that's something that's true of the whole training
01:22:15 for the whole family exactly viruses so it's not like someone has been messing with this for millions of years
01:22:20 and you know changing this happens naturally that's again beautiful that that somehow happens that
01:22:25 they recombine in the so two different strands can affect the so all of this actually magic happens
01:22:33 inside  hosts like all like yeah yeah that way that's why classification wise virus is
01:22:40 not thought to be alive because it doesn't self-replicate it's not autonomous it's something that enters
01:22:47 a living cell and then co-opts it to basically make it its own but by itself people ask me how do we
01:22:52 kill this bastard i'm like you stop it from replicating it's not like a bacterium that will just
01:23:01 live in a you know puddle or something it's a virus viruses don't live without their host
01:23:06 and they only live in their house for very little time so if you stop it from replicating it'll stop from spreading i mean it's
01:23:13 not like hiv which can stay dormant for a long time basically coronaviruses just don't do that they're not integrating
01:23:17 genomes there are any genomes so if it's not expressed it degrades rna degrades it doesn't just stick around well let me
01:23:25 ask also about the immune system you mentioned a lot of people kind of ask
01:23:32 you know how can we strengthen the immune system to respond to this particular virus but
01:23:37 the viruses in general do you have from a biological perspective thoughts on what we can do
01:23:42 as humans  too if you look at our traits across different countries
01:23:48 people with less vaccination have been dying more if you look at north italy the
01:23:52 vaccination rates are abysmal there and a lot of people have been dying if you look at greece
01:23:59 very good vaccination rates almost no one has been dying so yes there's a policy component
01:24:06 so italy reacted very slowly greece reacted very fast so yeah many fewer people died in greece
01:24:10 but there might actually be a component of genetic immune repertoire basically how did people die off you
01:24:17 know in the history of the greek population versus the italian population there's a
01:24:24 that's interesting to think about  and then there's a component of what vaccinations did you have as a
01:24:30 kid and what are the off-target effects of those vaccinations so basically a vaccination can have two
01:24:35 components one is training your your immune system against that specific insult
01:24:41 the second one is boosting up your immune system for all kinds of other things if you look at allergies northern europe
01:24:50 super clean environments tons of allergies southern europe my kids grew up eating dirt no allergies so growing
01:24:59 up i never had even heard of what allergies are like really allergies and the reason is that i was playing in
01:25:04 the garden i was putting all kinds of stuff in my mouth from you know all kinds of dirt and stuff
01:25:09 tons of viruses there tons of bacteria there you know my immune system was built up
01:25:15 so the more you protect your immune system from exposure the less opportunity it has to learn
01:25:20 about non-self repertoire in a way that prepares it for the next insult
01:25:26 so it's a horizontal thing too like the says throughout your lifetime in the lifetime of the
01:25:33 of the people that  your ancestors yeah that kind of thing yeah what about the so again it returns
01:25:37 against free will on the free will side of things is there something we could do
01:25:44 to strengthen our immune system in 2020 is there like  you know exercise diet all that kind of stuff so it's kind
01:25:52 of funny there's a cartoon that basically shows  two windows
01:25:58 with a teller in each window one has a humongous line and the other one has no one the one
01:26:03 that has no one above says health no it says exercise and diet and the other one says pill yeah
01:26:12 and there's a huge line for pill so we're looking basically for magic bullets for sort of
01:26:17 ways that we can you know beat cancer and beat coronavirus and beat this and beat that and it turns out that the
01:26:21 window with like just diet and exercise is the best way to boost
01:26:26 every aspect of your health if you look at alzheimer's exercise and nutrition
01:26:33 i mean you're like really for my brain neurodegeneration absolutely if you look at cancer exercise and nutrition if you look at coronavirus
01:26:44 exercise and nutrition every single aspect of human health gets improved and one of the studies
01:26:49 we're doing now is basically looking at what are the effects of diet and exercise how similar are they to each other we're
01:26:57 basically taking diet intervention and exercise intervention in human and in mice
01:27:02 and we're basically doing single cell profiling of a bunch of different tissues to basically understand
01:27:09 how are the cells both the stromal cells and the immune cells of each of these tissues responding to
01:27:15 the effect of exercise what are the communication networks between different cells where with the muscle that exercises
01:27:24 sends signals through the bloodstream through the lymphatic system through all kinds of other systems
01:27:30 that give signals to other cells that i have exercised and you should change in this particular way
01:27:35 which basically reconfigure those receptor cells with the effect of exercise how well
01:27:41 understood is the those reconfigurations very little we're just starting now basically is
01:27:48 there is the hope there  to understand the effect on  so like the effect on the immune
01:27:55 system on the immune system the effect on brain the effect on your liver on your
01:28:00 digestive system on your adipocytes adipose you know the most misunderstood organ everybody thinks oh
01:28:07 fat terrible no fat is awesome your fat cells is what's keeping you alive because if you didn't have your fat
01:28:13 cells all those lipids and all those calories would be floating around in your blood and you'd be dead by now
01:28:18 your adipocytes are your best friend they're basically storing all these excess calories so that they
01:28:23 don't hurt all of the rest of the body and they're also fat burning in many ways so you know again
01:28:32 when you don't have the homozygous version that i have your cells are able to burn calories much more easily
01:28:38 by sort of flipping a master metabolic switch that involves this fto locus that i mentioned earlier and its target genes
01:28:44 irx3 and rx5 that basically switch your adipocytes during their
01:28:50 three first days of differentiation as they're becoming mature dipocytes to basically become either fat burning
01:28:57 or fat storing fat cells and the fat burning fat cells are your best friends they're much closer to muscle
01:29:03 than they are to white egg boss eyes is there a lot of difference between people like that you could give science could
01:29:09 eventually give advice that is very generalizable or is our differences in our genetic makeup
01:29:16 like you mentioned is that going to be basically something we have to
01:29:23 be very specialized individuals any advice we give in terms of diet like we were just talking about believe
01:29:28 it or not the most personalized advice that you give for nutrition don't have to do with your genome they
01:29:32 have to do with your gut microbiome with the bacteria that live inside you so most of your
01:29:38 digestion is actually happening by species that are not human inside you you have more non-human cells and you
01:29:42 have human cells you're basically a giant bag of bacteria and those do not necessarily have to do
01:29:54 with your genetic makeup they interact with your genetic makeup they interact with your ruby genome they
01:29:59 interact with your nutrition they interact with your environment they're you know basically
01:30:06 an additional source of variation so when you're thinking about sort of personalized nutritional advice
01:30:11 part of that is actually how do you match your microbiome and part of that is how do we match your genetics
01:30:18 but again you know this is a very diverse set of you know contributors and the effect
01:30:23 sizes are not enormous so i think the science for that is not fully developed yet
01:30:29 speaking of dyes because i've wrestled in combat sports with sports my whole life or
01:30:33 weight matters so you have to cut and all that stuff one thing i've learned a lot about my
01:30:38 body and which seems to be i think true about other people's bodies is that
01:30:45 you can adjust to a lot of things that's the miraculous thing about this biological system
01:30:51 is like i fast often i used to eat like five six times a day
01:30:56 and thought that was absolutely necessary how could you not eat that often and then when i started fasting your
01:31:02 body adjusts to that and you learn how to not eat you know and it's it was
01:31:07  if you just give it a chance for a few weeks actually over a period of a few weeks your body
01:31:12 can adjust to anything yeah and that's a miraculous that's such a beautiful thing so i'm a computer scientist
01:31:17 and i've basically gone through periods of 24 hours without eating or stopping and you know then i'm like oh must eat
01:31:23 and i eat a ton i used to order two pizzas just with my brother and you know like so i i've gone through
01:31:30 these extremes as well and i've gone the whole intermittent fasting thing so i can sympathize with you both on the seven
01:31:35 meals a day to the zero meals a day so i think when i say everything in moderation i i actually
01:31:44 think your body responds interestingly to these different changes in diet i think part of the reason why we lose
01:31:51 weight with pretty much every kind of change in behavior is because our epigenome and the set of proteins
01:31:57 and enzymes that are expressed and our microbiome are not well suited to that nutritional source
01:32:03 and therefore they will not be able to sort of catch everything that you give them and then you know a lot of
01:32:09 that will go undigested and that basically means that your body can then you know lose weight in the
01:32:13 short term but very quickly will adjust to that new normal and then we'll be able to sort of
01:32:19 perhaps gain a lot of weight yeah from the diet so anyway i mean there's also studies in um
01:32:25 factories where basically people you know dim the lights and then suddenly everybody started working
01:32:30 better it was like wow that's amazing three weeks later they made the lights a little brighter everybody started
01:32:35 working better so any kind of intervention has a placebo effect of wow now i'm healthier
01:32:41 and i'm going to be running more often etc so it's very hard to uncouple the placebo effect of wow i'm doing
01:32:47 something to intervene on my diet from the wow this is actually the right thing for me
01:32:51 so you know yeah from the perspective from nutrition science psychology both things i'm interested in especially
01:32:58 psychology it seems that it's extremely difficult to do good science because  there's so many variables
01:33:05 involved it's so difficult to control the variables so difficult to do sufficiently
01:33:09 large-scale experiments  both sort of in terms of number of subjects and
01:33:16 temporal like how long you do the study for that  it just seems like it's not even a real science
01:33:22 for now like nutrition science i want to jump into the whole placebo effect for a little bit here
01:33:28 and basically talk about the implications of that if i give you a sugar pill and tell you
01:33:34 it's a sugar pill you won't get any better but if i tell you sugar appeal and tell you and
01:33:39 i tell you wow this is an amazing drug it actually will stop your cancer your cash will actually stop with much
01:33:46 higher probability what does that mean that's so amazing that means that if i can trick your
01:33:51 brain into thinking that i'm healing you your brain will basically figure out a way to heal itself to heal the body
01:33:58 and that tells us that there's so much that we don't understand in the interplay between our cognition
01:34:06 and our biology that if we were able to better harvest the power of our brain to sort of you know
01:34:12 impact the body through the placebo effect we would be so much better in so many different
01:34:18 things just by tricking yourself into thinking that you're doing better you're actually doing better
01:34:22 so there's something to be said about sort of positive thinking about optimism about sort of
01:34:29 you know just getting your brain and your mind into the right mindset that helps your body and helps your
01:34:37 entire biology yeah from a science perspective that's just fascinating i
01:34:41 obviously most things about the brain is a total mystery for now but that's a fascinating interplay that
01:34:47 the brain yeah that the brain can reduce  the brain can help cure cancer as a
01:34:56 i don't even know what to do with that i mean the way to think about that is the following the converse of the equation is
01:35:02 something that we are much more comfortable with like oh if you're stressed then
01:35:08 your heart right might rise and all kinds of sort of toxins might be released and
01:35:13 that can have a detrimental effect in your body etc so maybe it's easier to understand your body
01:35:21 healing from your mind by your mind is not killing your body or at least it's killing it less so i
01:35:26 think the you know that aspect of the stress equation is a little easier
01:35:31 for most of us to conceptualize but then the healing part is you know perhaps the same pathways
01:35:36 perhaps different pathways but again something that is totally untapped scientifically i think we try to bring
01:35:42 this question up a couple of times but let's return to it again is what do you think is the difference between the
01:35:48 way a computer represents information the human genome represents and stores information
01:35:55 like what and maybe broadly what is the difference between how you think about computers and how
01:36:00 you think about biological systems so i made a very provocative claim earlier that we are a digital computer
01:36:05 like that at the core lies a digital code and that's true in many ways but surrounding that digital core there's a
01:36:11 huge amount of analog if you look at our brain it's not really digital if you look at our sort of
01:36:16 rna and all of that stuff inside our cell it's not really digital it's really analog in many ways but let's start with
01:36:23 the code and then we'll expand to the rest so the code itself is digital so there's genes you can think of the
01:36:31 genes as i don't know the procedures the functions inside your language and then
01:36:36 somehow you have to turn these functions on how do you call a gene how do you call that function the way that you
01:36:40 would do it in old programming languages is go to address whatever in your memory and then you
01:36:46 start running from there and you know modern programming languages have encapsulated this into
01:36:51 functions and objects and all of that and it's nice and cute but in the end deep down
01:36:55 there's still an assembly code that says go to that instruction and it runs that instruction if you look at the human genome and you
01:37:03 know the genome of pretty much most species out there it's there's no go-to function you just don't start
01:37:11 in you know transcribing in position thirteen hundred five you know thirteen thousand five hundred twenty
01:37:20 seven in chromosome 12. you instead have content based indexing so at every location in the genome in front of the genes that
01:37:28 need to be turned on i don't know when you drink coffee there's a little coffee marker
01:37:36 in front of all of them and whenever your cells that metabolize coffee need to metabolize coffee they basically see
01:37:42 coffee and they're like oh let's go turn on all the coffee marked jeans so
01:37:47 there's basically these small motifs these small sequences that we call regulatory motifs they're
01:37:52 like patterns of dna they're only eight characters long or so like gat gca et cetera and these motifs work in combinations
01:38:04 and every one of them has some recruitment affinity for a different protein that will then come and bind it
01:38:11 and together collections of these motifs create regions that we call regulatory regions that can
01:38:16 be either promoters near the beginning of the gene and that basically tells you where the
01:38:22 function actually starts where you call it and then enhancers that are looping around of the dna
01:38:28 that basically bring the machinery that binds those enhancers and then bring it onto the promoter
01:38:33 which then recruits the right sort of the ribosome and the polymerase and all of that thing
01:38:39 which will first transcribe and then export and then eventually translate in the cytoplasm
01:38:46 you know whatever rna molecule so the beauty of the way that the digital computer
01:38:55 that's the genome works is that it's extremely fault tolerant if i took your hard drive and i messed
01:39:03 with twenty percent of the letters in it of those zeros and ones and i flipped them
01:39:09 you'd be in trouble if i take the genome and i flip 20 of the letters you probably won't even notice
01:39:16 and that resilience that's fascinating again is a key design principle and again i'm
01:39:21 triple morphizing here but it's a key driving principle of how biological systems work
01:39:27 they're first resilient and then anything else and when you look at this incredible
01:39:32 beauty of life from the most i don't know beautiful i don't know human genome maybe of
01:39:39 humanity and all of the ideals that should come with it to the most terrifying genome like i
01:39:45 don't know kovit-19 sarsko v2 and the current pandemic you basically see this elegance as
01:39:54 the epitome of clean design but it's dirty it's a mess it's you know the the way to get there is
01:40:03 hugely messy and that's something that we as computer scientists don't embrace we like to have clean code
01:40:11 you know as like in engineering they teach you about compartmentalization about sort of separating functions about
01:40:17 modularity about hierarchical design none of that applies in bio testing testing sure yeah biology does plenty of
01:40:24 that but i mean through evolutionary exploration but um
01:40:32 if you look at biological systems first they are robust and then they specialize to become anything else
01:40:38 and if you look at viruses the reason why they're so elegant when you look at the design of
01:40:43 this you know genome it seems so elegant and the reason for that is that it's been
01:40:49 stripped down from something much larger because of the pressure to keep it compact
01:40:56 so many compact genomes out there have ancestors that were much larger you don't start small and become big you
01:41:02 go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff increase complexity and then
01:41:08 you know slim it down and one of my early papers was in fact on genome duplication one of the things
01:41:14 we found is that baker's yeast which is the you know yeast that you use to make bread but also the yeast that you use to
01:41:19 make wine which is basically the dominant species when you go in the fields of tuscany and
01:41:23 you say you know what's out there it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae or the way my italian friends say saccharomyces
01:41:34 so  which means what oh sakura okay i'm sorry i'm i'm greek so yeah zacharo
01:41:40 mickeys zacharo is sugar minky's is fungus yes cerevisiae cerveza beer so so it means the sugar fungus of beer yeah
01:41:51 you know less less sounding to the still poetic yeah so anyway  saccharomyces cerevisiae basically the
01:41:57 major baker's yeast out there is the descendant of a whole genome duplication why would a whole genuine duplication
01:42:04 even happen when it happened is coinciding with about 100 million years ago
01:42:11 and the emergence of fruit-bearing plants why fruit-bearing plants because animals
01:42:17 would eat the fruit and would walk around and poop huge amounts of nutrients along with a seed
01:42:27 for the plants to spread before that plants were not spreading through animals they were spreading through wind
01:42:32 and all kinds of other ways but basically the moment you have fruit-bearing plants
01:42:37 the the the these plants are basically creating this abundance of sugar in the environment so there's an evolutionary
01:42:42 niche that gets created and in that evolutionary niche you basically have enough sugar
01:42:48 that a whole genome duplication which initially is a very messy event allows you to then you know relieve some
01:42:56 of that complexity so to pause what does genome duplication mean that basically means that instead of
01:43:03 having eight chromosomes you can now have 16 chromosomes so but with the duplication at first
01:43:10 when you have six when you go to 16 you're not using that oh yeah you are yeah so basically from
01:43:17 one day to the next you went from having eight chromosomes to having 16 chromosomes
01:43:22 probably a non-disjunction event during a duplication during a division so you basically divide the cell instead
01:43:27 of half the genome going this way and half the genome going the other way after duplication of the genome you basically
01:43:33 have all of it going to one cell and then there's a sufficient messiness there that you end up with
01:43:39 slight differences that make most of these chromosomes be actually preserved it's a long story short but it's a big
01:43:45 upgrade right so that's not necessarily because what happens immediately thereafter is that you start
01:43:50 massively losing tons of those duplicated genes so ninety percent of those genes were actually lost
01:43:58 very rapidly after holding duplication and the reason for that is that biology is not intelligent it's just
01:44:06 ruthless selection random mutation so the ruthless selection basically means that as soon as one of the random
01:44:11 mutations hit one gene ruthless selection just kills off that gene it's just you know
01:44:17 you you know if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome you will very rapidly lose the second
01:44:22 copy of most of your genes and a small number 10 were kept in two copies and those had to do a lot with
01:44:30 environment adaptation with the speed of replication with the speed of translation and with sugar processing
01:44:36 so i'm making a long story short to basically say that evolution is messy the only way like so so
01:44:42 you know the example that i was giving of messing with 20 of your bits in your computer totally bogus
01:44:49 duplicating all your functions and just throwing them out there in the same you know function just totally bogus
01:44:54 like this would never work in an engineer system but biological systems because of this
01:44:59 content-based indexing and because of this modularity that comes from the fact that the gene is controlled by a series of
01:45:06 tags and now if you need this gene in another setting you just add some more tags that will basically turn it on
01:45:13 also in those settings so this gene is now pressured to to do two different functions and it
01:45:19 builds up complexity i see a whole term duplication and gene duplication in general as a way to
01:45:24 relieve that complexity so you have this gradual buildup of complexity as functions get
01:45:29 past get sort of added on to the existing genes and then boom you duplicate your your workforce
01:45:36 and you now have two copies of this gene one will probably specialize to do one and the other one will specialize to do
01:45:41 the other or one will maintain the ancestral function the other one will sort of
01:45:46 be free to evolve and specialize while losing the ancestral functions and so forth so that's how genomes
01:45:50 evolve they're they're just messy things but they're extremely fault tolerant and they're extremely able to deal with
01:45:59 mutations because that's the very way that you generate new functions so new functionalization comes from
01:46:08 the very thing that breaks it so even in the current pandemic many people are asking me which
01:46:12 mutations matter the most and what i tell them is well we can study the evolutionary dynamics of the
01:46:17 current genome to then understand which mutations have previously happened or not and
01:46:27 which mutations happen in genes that evolve rapidly or not and one of the things we found for
01:46:32 example is that the genes that evolved rapidly in the past are still evolving rapidly now in
01:46:37 the current pandemic the genes have evolved slowly in the past are still evolving slowly
01:46:43 which means that they're useful which means that they're under the same evolutionary pressures
01:46:47 but then the question is what happens in specific mutations so if you look at the d614 gene mutation
01:46:54 that's been all over the news so in position 614 in the amino acids and harvest 14
01:47:01 of the s protein there's a d to g mutation that that sort of has creeped over
01:47:08 the population mutation we found out through my work disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide position
01:47:15 that has never been changed in the history of millions of years of equivalent
01:47:20 mammalian evolution of these viruses that basically means that it's a completely new adaptation
01:47:29 to human and that mutation has now gone from one percent frequency to 90 frequency in almost all outbreaks
01:47:35 so this mutation i like how you say in the mu the 416 what was it okay yes 6 on 14 sorry
01:47:41 614 right that d614g dc so so literally so what you're saying is it's like a
01:47:48 chess move yeah so it's just mutated one letter to another exactly and that hasn't happened before
01:47:56 yeah and and this somehow this mutation is really useful  it's really useful in the current
01:48:01 environment of the genome which is moving from human to human when it was moving from bad to bad
01:48:08 it couldn't care less for that mutation but it's environment specific so now that it's moving from human to human
01:48:14 whoo-hoo it's moving way better like by orders of magnetism what do you okay so so you're like tracking this
01:48:20 evolutionary dynamics which is fascinating but what do you do with that
01:48:25 so what does that mean what does this mean what do you make what do you make of this mutation in 
01:48:31 trying to anticipate i guess is is the is one of the things you're trying to do is anticipate
01:48:37 where how this unrolls into the future this this evolutionary dynamics such a great
01:48:41 question so so there's there's two things remember when i was saying earlier mutation is the path
01:48:48 to new things but also the path to break old things so what we know is that this position
01:48:54 was extremely preserved through gazillions of mutations that mutation was never tolerated when it was
01:49:00 moving from best to bats so that basically means that that contain that position is extremely important
01:49:05 in the function of that protein that's the first thing it tells the second one is that
01:49:11 that position was very well suited to bat transmission but now is not well suited to human transmission
01:49:16 so it got rid of it and it now has a new version of that amino acid that basically makes it much easier to transmit from human to human
01:49:25 so in terms of the evolutionary history teaching us about the future
01:49:31 it basically tells us here's the regions that are currently mutating here's the regions
01:49:37 that are most likely to imitate going forward as you're building a vaccine here's what you should be focusing on
01:49:43 in terms of the most stable regions that are the least likely to mutate or here's the newly evolved functions
01:49:50 that are most likely to be important because they've overcome this local maximum that it had reached in the in the
01:50:00 bat transmission so anyway it's a tangent to basically say that evolution works in messy ways and the
01:50:05 thing that you would break is the thing that actually allows you to first
01:50:12 go through a lull and then reaching new local maximum and i often like to say that if engineers
01:50:21 had basically designed evolution we would still be because it's by making the bacterium
01:50:30 worse that you allow evolution to reach a new optimum that's just a pause on that
01:50:36 that's so profound the the that's so profound for the entirety of um
01:50:42 this scientific and engineering disciplines exactly we as engineers need to embrace breaking things
01:50:50 we as engineers need to embrace robustness as the first principle beyond perfection because nothing is
01:50:56 going to ever be perfect and when you're sending a satellite to mars when something goes wrong
01:51:02 it'll break down as opposed to building systems that tolerate failure and are resilient to that
01:51:11 and in fact get better through that so the spacex approach versus nasa for the for example
01:51:19 is there something we can learn about the incredible  take lessons from the incredible
01:51:25 biological systems in their resilience in their in the mushiness the messiness to 
01:51:31 to our computing systems to  to our computers it would basically be starting from scratch in many ways
01:51:37 it would basically be building new paradigms that don't try to get the right answer all the time
01:51:44 but try to get the right answer most of the time or a lot of the time do you see deep learning systems in the
01:51:50 whole world of machine learning is kind of taking a step in that direction absolutely absolutely basically by allowing
01:51:58 this much more natural evolution of these parameters you basically and then if you look at sort of deep learning
01:52:03 systems again they're not inspired by the genome aspect of biology they're inspired by
01:52:10 the brain aspect of biology and again i want you to pause for a second and
01:52:16 realize the complexity of the entire human brain with trillions of connections within our
01:52:22 you know neurons with millions of cells talking to each other that same genome encodes every single
01:52:36 freaking cell type of the entire body every single cell is encoded by the same code
01:52:44 and yet specialization allows you to have this single viral-like genome that self-replicates
01:52:54 the single module modular automaton work with other copies of itself it's mind-boggling create complex organs through which
01:53:02 blood flows and what is that blood the same freaking genome create organs that communicate with each other
01:53:13 and what are these organs the exact same genome create a brain that is innervated by massive amounts of blood pumping
01:53:22 energy to it 20 of our energetic needs to the brain from the same genome and
01:53:29 all of the neuronal connections all of the auxiliary cells all of the immune cells
01:53:35 the astrocytes the ligand size the neurons the excitatory the inhibitory neurons all of the different classes of parasites
01:53:41 the blood-brain barrier all of that same genome one way to see that in a sad so this one is beautiful the sad thing
01:53:50 is thinking about the trillions of organisms that died to create that you mean on the evolutionary path and
01:53:59 the evolutionary path to humans that's crazy there's two descendants of apes just
01:54:07 talking on the podcast okay this is so mind-boggling just just to boggle our minds a little bit more
01:54:13 yeah us talking to each other we are basically generating a series of vocal utterances
01:54:22 through our pulsating of vocal chords received through this the people who listen to this are taking a completely different
01:54:31 path to that information transfer yet through language but imagine if we could connect these brains
01:54:39 directly to each other the amount of information that i'm condensing into a small number of words
01:54:47 is a huge funnel which then you receive and you expand into a huge number of thoughts in many ways engineers would love to
01:54:59 have the whole information transfer just take the whole set of neurons and throw them away i mean throw them to the
01:55:05 other person this might actually not be better because in
01:55:11 your misinterpretation of every word that i'm saying you are creating new interpretation that
01:55:16 might actually be way better than what i meant to the first place the ambiguity of language perhaps
01:55:24 might be the secret to creativity every single time you work on a project by yourself
01:55:31 you only bounce ideas with one person and your neurons are basically fully cognizant of what these ideas are
01:55:37 but the moment you interact with another person the misinterpretations that happen might be
01:55:43 the most creative part of the process with my students every time we have a research meeting i very often pause and say
01:55:49 let me repeat what you just said in a different way and i sort of go on and brainstorm with what they were saying but by the
01:55:55 third time it's not what they were saying at all and when they pick up what i'm saying
01:56:00 you're like oh well now they they've sort of learned something very different from what i was
01:56:07 saying and that is the same kind of messiness that i'm describing in the genome itself
01:56:13 it's sort of embracing the messiness and that's a feature not a book exactly and in the same way when you're
01:56:18 thinking about sort of these deep learning systems that will allow us to sort of be more
01:56:23 creative perhaps or learn better approximations of these complex functions
01:56:29 again tuned to the universe that we inhabit you have to embrace the breaking you have to embrace the
01:56:36 you know how do we get out of these local optima and a lot of the design paradigms that have made deep
01:56:43 learning so successful are ways to get away from that ways to get better training by sort of sending long
01:56:50 range messages these lstm models and the you know sort of feed forward loops that
01:56:59 you know sort of jump through layers of a convolutional neural network all of these things are basically ways
01:57:05 to push you out of this local maxima and that's sort of what evolution does that's what language does that's what
01:57:12 conversation and brainstorming does that's what our brain does so you know this design paradigm is
01:57:18 something that's pervasive and yet not taught in schools not taught in engineering schools
01:57:24 where everything is minutely modularized to make sure that we never deviate from you know whatever signal we're trying to emit
01:57:31 as opposed to let all hell breaks loose because that's the way that's the path of paradise
01:57:36 the path to paradise yeah i mean it's difficult to know how to teach that and  what to do with it i mean it's um
01:57:43 it's difficult to know how to build up a sign the scientific method around messiness you i mean
01:57:50 it's not all messiness we need we need some cleanness and going back to the example with mars
01:57:55 that's probably the place where i want to sort of moderate error as much as possible and sort of
01:58:00 control the environment as much as possible but if you're trying to repopulate mars
01:58:04 well maybe messiness is a good thing then on that  you quick you quickly mentioned this in terms of
01:58:13 us using our vocal cords to speak on a podcast so elon musk and neurolink are working on
01:58:21 trying to plug as per discussion with computers and biological systems
01:58:27 to connect the two he's trying to con connect our brain to a computer to create a brain computer
01:58:33 interface where they can communicate back and forth on this line of thinking do you think this is 
01:58:42 possible to bridge the gap between our engineered computing systems and the messy biological systems
01:58:52 my answer would be absolutely we you know there's no doubt that we can understand more and more about what goes
01:58:57 on in the brain and we can sort of train the brain i mean i don't know if you remember the
01:59:03 palm pilot yeah palm pilot yeah remember this whole sort of alphabet that they had created
01:59:11 am i thinking of the same thing it's basically you had you had a little pen and for every character you had a little scribble
01:59:18 that was unique that the machine could understand and that instead of trying the machine trying to
01:59:24 teach the machine to recognize human characters you had basically they figured out that it's better and easier
01:59:31 to train humans to create human-like characters that the machine is better at recognizing so
01:59:38 in the same way i think what will happen is that humans will be trained to be able to create
01:59:43 the mind pattern that the machine will respond to before the machine truly comprehends our
01:59:48 thoughts so the first human brain interfaces will be tricking humans to speak the machine language
01:59:55 where with the right set of electrodes i can sort of trick my brain into doing this and this is the same way that many
02:00:01 people teach like learn to control artificial limbs you basically try a bunch of stuff and
02:00:06 eventually you figure out how your limbs work that might not be very different from how humans learn to use their
02:00:12 natural limbs when they first grow up basically you have these you know neoteny period of
02:00:20 you know this puddle of soup inside your brain trying to figure out how to even make your own connections before you're born
02:00:29 and then learning sounds in utero of you know all kinds of echoes and you know eventually getting out in the
02:00:35 real world and i don't know if you've seen newborns but they just stare around a lot
02:00:41 you know one way to think about this as a machine learning person is oh they're just training their edge detectors
02:00:47 and eventually they figure out how to train their edge detectors they work through the second layer of the visual
02:00:52 cortex and the third layer and so forth and you basically have this learning how to control your limbs
02:01:00 that probably comes at the same time you're sort of you know throwing random things there and you realize that oh wow
02:01:05 when i do this thing my limb moves let's do the following what muscles did you flex now take
02:01:15 another breath and think what muscles do i flex the first thing that you're thinking
02:01:19 when you're taking a breath is the impact that he has on your lungs you're like oh i'm now going to increase
02:01:24 my lungs or i'm not going to bring air in but what you're actually doing is just changing your diaphragm yeah
02:01:32 that's not conscious of course you never think of the diaphragm as a thing yeah and why is that that's probably the
02:01:38 same reason why i think of moving my finger when i actually move my finger i think of the effect instead of
02:01:43 actually thinking of whatever muscle is twitching that actually causes my finger to move so we basically in our first years of life
02:01:52 build up this massive lookup table between whatever neuronal firing we do and whatever action happens
02:02:00 in our body that we control if you have a kid grow up with a third limb i'm sure they'll figure out how to
02:02:07 control them probably at the same rate as their natural limbs and  a lot of the work would be done
02:02:12 by the so if the third limb is the computer you kind of have a
02:02:20  not a faith but a thought that the brain might be able to figure out like if the plasticity would come from
02:02:27 the brain yeah like the brain would be cleverer than the machine at first when i talk about a third limb that's exactly
02:02:30 what i'm saying an artificial limb that basically just controls your mouse while you're typing
02:02:36 you know perfectly natural thing i mean again you know in a few hundred years maybe sooner than that but but basically there's
02:02:46 as long as the machine is consistent in the way that it will respond to your brain impulses you'll figure out
02:02:51 how to control that and you could play tennis with your third limb and
02:02:58 let me go back to consistency people who have dramatic accidents that basically take out a whole chunk of their brain
02:03:06 can be taught to co-opt other parts of the brain to then control that part you can basically build up that tissue
02:03:12 again and eventually train your body how to walk again and how to read again and how to play again and how to think
02:03:18 again how to speak a language again etc so there's a massive amount of malleability that happens you know naturally in
02:03:26 our way of controlling our body our brain or thoughts or vocal cords or limbs etc and
02:03:35 human machine interfaces are inevitable if we sort of figure out how to read these electric impulses
02:03:41 but the resolution at which we can understand human thought right now is nil is ridiculous
02:03:49 so how are human thoughts encoded it's basically combinations of neurons that co-fire and these create
02:03:55 these things called engrams that eventually form memories and so so forth
02:04:01 we know nothing of all that stuff so before we can actually read into your brain that you want to build a program
02:04:08 that does this anytime it's on that we need a lot of neuroscience well so  to push back on that do you think
02:04:15 it's possible that without understanding the functionally about the brain or the from the
02:04:21 neuroscience or the cognitive science or psychology whichever level of the brain will look at do you think if we just connect
02:04:28 connect them just like per your previous point if we just have a high enough resolution between connection between
02:04:34  wikipedia and your brain the brain will just figure it out with us understanding because that's
02:04:39 one of the innovations of neural link is they're increasing the number of
02:04:44 connections to the brain to like several thousand which before was you know in the dozens or whatever
02:04:50 you're still off by a few orders of magnets right but the the thing is the hope is if you increase that number more and
02:04:58 more and more maybe you don't need to understand anything about the actual
02:05:04 how human thought is represented in the brain you could just let it let it figure it out by itself
02:05:09 well  cannery is waking up and saying i know yeah exactly exactly so
02:05:15 yeah sure you don't have faith in the plasticity of the brain to that degree it's not about brain plasticity it's
02:05:21 about the input aspect basically i think on the output aspect being able to control a machine
02:05:26 is something that you can probably train your neural impulses that you're sending out to sort of match whatever
02:05:33 response you see in the environment if this thing moved every single time i thought a particular thought
02:05:37 then i could figure out i could hack my way into moving this thing with just a series of thoughts i could think
02:05:45 guitar piano tennis ball and then this thing would be moving and then you know i would just have the
02:05:50 series of thoughts that would sort of result in the impulses that will move this thing
02:05:54 the way that i want it and then eventually it'll become natural because i won't even think about it
02:05:58 i mean the same way that we control our limbs in a very natural way but babies don't do that babies have to
02:06:03 figure it out and you know some of it is hard-coded but some of that is actually learned
02:06:09 based on the whatever soup of neurons you ended up with whatever connections you pruned them to and eventually you
02:06:15 were born with you know a lot of that is coded in the genome but a huge chunk of that is stochastic
02:06:20 instead of the way that you sort of create all these neurons they migrate they form connections they sort of
02:06:25 you know spread out they have particular branching patterns but then the connectivity itself
02:06:31 unique in every single new person all this to say that on the output side absolutely i'm very very you know um
02:06:38 hopeful that we can have machines that read thousands of these neuronal connections on the output side but on the input side
02:06:50 i don't expect any time in the near future we'll be able to sort of send a series of impulses that will tell me
02:06:58 oh earth to sun distance 7.5 million et cetera like nowhere i mean i think language will still the
02:07:06 be the input way rather than sort of any kind of more complex it's a really interesting notion that
02:07:11 the ambiguity of language is a feature yeah and we evolved for millions of years to  to take advantage of that
02:07:20 ambiguity exactly and yet no one teaches us the subtle differences between
02:07:26 words that are near cognates and yet evoke so much more than you know one from the other and yet
02:07:34 you know when you're choosing words from a list of 20 synonyms you know exactly the connotation of
02:07:40 every single one of them and that's something that you know is there so so yes there's ambiguity
02:07:46 but there's all kinds of connotations and in the way that we select our words we have so much baggage that we're
02:07:52 sending along the way that we're emoting the way that we're moving our hands every single time we speak
02:07:57 the you know the pauses the eye contact etc so much higher baud rate than just a vocal you know string of characters well let me
02:08:07 just take a small tangent on that oh tangent we haven't done that yet and i haven't done an idea
02:08:18 so i mean you're greek but i'm i'm going on this personal journey  i'm going to paris
02:08:26 for the explicit purpose of talking to one of the most famous  a couple who's a famous translators of
02:08:33 russian literature dostoyevsky tolstoy yeah and they go that's their art is the translation and
02:08:42 everything i've learned about the translation art it makes me feel um
02:08:52 it's so profound in a way that's so much more profound than the natural language processing papers i read in the
02:08:57 machine learning community that there's such depth to language that i don't know what to do with i
02:09:04 don't know if you've experienced that in your own life with knowing multiple languages um
02:09:10 i don't know what to i don't know how to make sense of it but there's so much loss in translation between russian and english
02:09:17 and getting a sense of that like for example there's like just taking a single sentence from dostoyevsky
02:09:25 and like there's a lot of them you could you could talk for hours about how to translate that
02:09:29 sentence properly  that captures the meaning the the the period the culture the humor the wit the
02:09:37 suffering that was in the context of the time all of that it could be a single sentence 
02:09:45 you could you could talk forever about what it takes to translate that correctly i don't know what to do with that
02:09:51 so being greek it's very hard for me to think of a sentence or even a word without going
02:09:58 into the full etymology of that word breaking up every single atom of that that sentence and every single atom
02:10:07 of these words and rebuilding it back up i have three kids and the way that i teach them greek is
02:10:16 the same way that you know the documentary i was mentioning earlier about sort of understanding the deep roots
02:10:23 of all of these you know words and it's very it's very interesting that every single
02:10:31 time i hear a new word that i've never heard before i go and figure out the etymology of
02:10:35 that word because i will never appreciate that word without understanding how it was
02:10:40 initially formed interesting but how does that help because that's that's not the full picture
02:10:45 no no of course of course but what i'm trying to say is that knowing the components teaches you about the context of the
02:10:52 formation of that word and sort of the original usage of that word and then of course the word takes
02:10:57 new meaning as you create it you know from its parts and that meaning then gets augmented
02:11:06 and two synonyms that that sort of have different roots will actually have implications that
02:11:11 carry a lot of that baggage of the historical provenance of these words so before working on genome evolution
02:11:19 my passion was evolution of language and sort of tracing cognates across different languages
02:11:27 through their etymologies and that's fascinating that there's parallels between i mean
02:11:32 of course the idea that there's evolutionary dynamics to our language yeah every single word that you
02:11:42 utter parallels parallels what does parallels mean para means side by side alleles from alleles
02:11:50 which means identical twins parallels i mean name any word and there's so much baggage so much beauty in how that word came to
02:11:59 be and how this word took a new meaning yeah and that and those and they're just they're just words they don't have any physical
02:12:10 exactly and now you take your words and you weave them into a sentence the emotional
02:12:18 invocations of that weaving are fathomless and they're all all of those emotions all live in our in the brains of humans
02:12:28 in the eye of the beholder no seriously you have to embrace this concept of the eye of the beholder
02:12:35 it's it's the the conceptualization that nothing takes meaning with one person creating it everything takes meaning
02:12:43 in the receiving end and the emergent properties of these communication networks where every single you know if you look at the
02:12:51 network of our cells and how they're communicating with each other every cell has its own code this code is
02:12:56 modulated by the epigenome this creates a bunch of different cell types each cell type now has its own identity
02:13:01 yet they all have the common root of the stem cells that sort of led to them each of these identities is
02:13:08 now communicating with each other they take meaning in their interaction there's an emergent property that comes
02:13:15 from a bunch of cells being together that is not in any one of the parts if you look at neurons communicating again these
02:13:23 engrams don't exist in any one neuron they exist in the connection in the combination of neurons
02:13:28 and the meaning of the words that i'm telling you is empty until it reaches you and it
02:13:34 affects you in a very different way then it affects whoever's listening to this conversation now
02:13:40 because of the emotional baggage that i've grown up with that you've grown up with and that they've grown up with yeah
02:13:46 and that's i think the magic of translation if you start thinking of translation as just simply capturing that emotional
02:13:57 set of reactions that you have that you evoke you need a different set of words to evoke that same set of reactions to a
02:14:04 french person than to a russian person because of the baggage of the culture that we grew up in
02:14:11 yeah i mean there's so so basically you shouldn't find the best word sometimes it's a
02:14:15 completely different sentence structure that you will need matched to the cultural context
02:14:23 of the target audience that you have yeah the it's i mean you're just i usually don't think about
02:14:28 this but right now there's this feeling as a reminder that it's just you and i talking
02:14:34 but there's several hundred thousand people will listen to this there's some guy in russia right now running
02:14:43  like in moscow listening to us and there's somebody in india i guarantee you there's somebody in China 
02:14:49 and south america there's somebody in texas and and they all have different emotional baggage they probably got
02:14:56 angry earlier on about the whole discussion about coronavirus and  about some aspect of it  yeah it's
02:15:05 and there's that network effect yeah yeah that's  it's a beautiful thing and and this lateral transfer of information
02:15:11 that's what makes the collective quote-unquote genome of humanity so unique from any other species
02:15:22 so you somehow miraculously wrapped it back to the very beginning of when we were talking about the human
02:15:28 the beauty of the human genome so i think this is the right time unless we want to go for
02:15:34 a six to eight hour conversation we're gonna have to talk again but i think for now to wrap it up this is
02:15:41 the right time to talk about the  the biggest most ridiculous question of all
02:15:46 meaning of life off mike you mentioned to me that you you had your 42nd birthday 40
02:15:56 a second being a very special absurdly special number  and you had to kind of um
02:16:03 get together with friends to discuss the meaning of life so let me ask you in your as a biologist as a computer scientist
02:16:15 what is the meaning of life i've been asking this question for a long time ever since my 42nd birthday
02:16:23 but well before that and even planning the meaning of life symposium and symposium
02:16:30 means together posey actually means to drink together so symposium is actually a drinking party
02:16:37 so can you actually elaborate about this meaning of life that you put together it's like the most genius idea i've ever
02:16:42 heard so 42 is obviously the answer to life the universe and everything from the
02:16:47 hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and as i was turning 42 i've had the theme for every one of my birthdays when
02:16:52 i was turning 32 it's one zero zero zero zero zero in binary so i celebrated my 100 000th binary
02:17:00 binary birthday and i had a theme of going back 100 000 years you know let's dress something
02:17:07 in the last hundred thousand years anyway it was we've i've always had these that's such an interesting human being
02:17:13 okay that's awesome i've always had these sort of  sort of numerology
02:17:19 related announcements for my for my birthday party so what came out of that
02:17:27 meaning of life symposium is that i basically asked 42 of my colleagues 42 my friends 42 of my
02:17:34 you know collaborators to basically give seven minute species on the meaning of life each from their
02:17:38 perspective and i really encourage you to go there because it's mind-boggling that every
02:17:44 single person said a different answer every single person started with
02:17:49 i don't know what the meaning of life is but and then give this beautifully eloquently answer eloquent answer
02:17:58 and they were all different but they all were consistent with each other and mutually synergistic
02:18:05 and together forming a beautiful view of what it means to be human in many ways some people talked about the loss of
02:18:12 their loved one their life partner for many many years and how their life changed through that
02:18:18 some people talked about the origin of life some people talked about the difference between purpose and meaning
02:18:27 i'll you know maybe quote one of the answers which is this linguistics  professor friend of mine at harvard
02:18:37 that she was gonna she's greek as well and she said i will give a very pythian answer so pithia was the oracle of delphi
02:18:44 who would basically give these very cryptic answers very short but interpretable in many different ways
02:18:49 there was this whole set of priests who were tasked with interpreting what pethia had said
02:18:55 and very often you would not get a clean interpretation but she said i will be like pethi and give you a very short
02:19:02 and multiple interpretable answer but unlike her i will actually also give you three interpretations
02:19:09 and she said the answer to the meaning of life is become one and the first interpretation is like a child
02:19:18 become one year old with the excitement of discovering everything about the world second interpretation in whatever you
02:19:24 take on become one the first the best excel drive yourself to perfection for every
02:19:32 one of your tasks and become one when people are separate become one come together
02:19:43 learn to understand each other damn that's an answer and one way to summarize this whole meaning of life symposium
02:19:51 is that the very symposium was illustrating the quest for meaning which might itself be the meaning of life this constant quest
02:20:03 for something sublime something human something intangible some you know aspect of what defines us as a species
02:20:13 and as an individual both the quest of me as a person through my own life but the meaning of life could also be
02:20:20 the meaning of all of life what is the whole point of life why life why life itself
02:20:26 because we've been talking about the history and evolution of life but we haven't talked about why life in
02:20:32 the first place is life inevitable is life part of physics does life transcend physics but fighting
02:20:40 by fighting against entropy by compartmentalizing and increasing concentrations rather than diluting away
02:20:49 is life a distinct entity in the universe beyond the traditional very simple physical rules that govern gravity and
02:20:58 you know electromagnetism and all of these forces is life another force is there a life
02:21:04 force is there a unique kind of set of principles that emerge of course built on top of the hardware
02:21:10 of physics but is it sort of a new layer of software or a new layer of a computer system so
02:21:15 that's at the level of you know big questions there's another aspect of
02:21:23 gratitude of basically what i you know what i like to say is during this pandemic i've basically
02:21:30 worked from 6 a.m until 7 00 pm every single day non-stop including saturday and sunday
02:21:36 i've basically broken all boundaries of where life personal life begins and work life you
02:21:41 know ends and  that has been exhilarating for me just just the intellectual pleasure
02:21:53 that i get from a day of exhaustion where at the end of the day my brain is hurting i'm telling my wife
02:22:00 wow i was useful today and there's a certain pleasure that comes from feeling useful
02:22:09 and there's a certain pleasure that comes from feeling grateful so i've written this little sort of prayer
02:22:18 for my kids to say at bedtime every night where they basically say thank you god for all you have given me and give me the strength
02:22:29 to give unto others with the same love we as a species are so special the only ones who worry about the
02:22:40 meaning of life and maybe that's what makes us human and what i like to say to my wife and to
02:22:50 my students during this pandemic work extravaganza is every now and then they ask me but how
02:22:57 do you do this and i'm like i'm a workaholic i love this this is me in the most unfiltered way the ability
02:23:06 to do something useful to feel that my brain is being used to interact with the smartest people on
02:23:12 the planet day in day out and to help them discover aspects of the human genome
02:23:20 of the human brain of human disease and the human condition that no one has seen before with data that we're capturing that
02:23:30 has never been observed and there's another aspect which is on the personal life many
02:23:35 people say oh i'm not going to have kids why bother they're missing half the picture if not
02:23:45 the whole picture teaching my kids about my view of the world and watching through their eyes the
02:23:54 naivete with which they start and the sophistication with which they end up
02:24:01 they understanding that they have of not just the natural world around them but the unfiltered criticism
02:24:13 that you get from your own children that knows no bounds of honesty and i've grown
02:24:23 components of my heart that i didn't know i had until you sense that fragility
02:24:34 that vulnerability of the children that immense love and passion the unfiltered egoism that we as adults
02:24:44 learn how to hide so much better it's just this back of emotions that tell me about the raw materials that
02:24:52 make a human being and how these raw materials can be arranged with more sophistication that
02:24:58 we learn through life to become truly human adults but there's something so beautiful about
02:25:07 seeing that progression between them the complexity of the language growing as more neural connections are formed
02:25:16 to to realize that the hardware is getting rearranged as their software is getting implemented
02:25:22 on that hardware that their frontal cortex continues to grow for another 10 years
02:25:29 these neuronal connections are continuing to form new neurons that actually get
02:25:35 replicated and formed and it's it's just incredible that we have this not just you grow the hardware for 30 years and
02:25:42 then you feed it all of the knowledge no no the knowledge is fed throughout and is shaping these neural connections as
02:25:48 they're forming so seeing that transformation from either your
02:25:54 own blood or from an adopted child is the most beautiful thing you can do as a human being
02:25:59 and it completes you it completes that path that journey the create life oh sure that's at
02:26:04 conception that's easy but create human life to add the human part that takes decades of compassion
02:26:15 of sharing of love and of anger and of impatience and patience and as a parent
02:26:23 i think i've become a very different kind of teacher because again i'm a professor my first
02:26:29 role is to bring adult human beings into a you know more mature level of adulthood
02:26:36 where they learn not just to do science but they learn the process of discovery and the process
02:26:42 of collaboration the process of sharing the process of conveying the knowledge of encapsulating
02:26:48 something incredibly complex and and sort of giving it up in sort of bite-sized chunks that the
02:26:54 rest of humanity can appreciate i tell my students all the time if you you know
02:26:59 like when an apple fall when when when a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to listen has it really fallen
02:27:04 the same way you do this awesome research if you write an impenetrable paper that no one will understand
02:27:09 it's as if you never did the awesome research so conveying of knowledge conveying this lateral transfer that i was talking
02:27:17 about at the very beginning of sort of human humanity and sort of the sharing of information
02:27:25 all of that has gotten so much more rich by seeing human beings grow in my own home because that
02:27:35 that makes me a better parent and that makes me a better teacher and a better mentor to the nurturing
02:27:42 of my adult children which are my research group first of all beautifully put connects
02:27:49 beautifully to the vertical and the horizontal inheritance of ideas that we've talked about at the very beginning
02:27:55 i don't think there's a better way to end it  on this poetic and powerful note  manolas thank you
02:28:03 so much for talking there's a huge honor we have to talk again about the origin of life about
02:28:11 epigenetics epigenomics and  some of the incredible research you're doing truly an honor thanks so much for talking
02:28:16 thank you such a pleasure it's such a pleasure i mean your questions are outstanding i've had such a blast here
02:28:23 i can't wait to be back awesome thanks for listening to this conversation with manolas kellis and thank you
