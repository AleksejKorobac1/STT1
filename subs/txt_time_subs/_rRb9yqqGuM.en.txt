00:00:20 hey bro so are you using these power stairs yeah I got four sets for says alright can I work in with you
00:00:29 seriously I'm so sick of this gym that one set of power stairs there's always a line to use it I mean come on
00:00:46 and this video I want to talk about strength standards there are three scenarios in which I think strength
00:00:52 standards can be meaningful first one is strength sports if you compete in powerlifting weightlifting Highland
00:00:59 Games or even in CrossFit there are qualifying totals that you might pay attention to if you want to do well in
00:01:04 these sports you'll need to meet national or world qualifying totals elite totals qualifying times for
00:01:11 CrossFit Watts I'm not really sure how that works but I know there are benchmarks standards that you can strive
00:01:16 to meet the next scenario in which legitimate strength standards are set the military this is a way to control
00:01:22 the masses the same way that you're required to uphold a certain appearance with hair cut and uniformed you must
00:01:28 meet or exceed minimum physical standards military strength standards are also a screening tool for example in
00:01:35 the Marine Corps if you can't do a certain number of pull-ups if you're overweight if you can't run three miles
00:01:40 in a certain time period we can't confidently say that you have what it takes to pass basic training this
00:01:46 extends to occupation strength standards for example a utility worker like a lineman who climbs up telephone poles as
00:01:54 an employer I probably wouldn't hire someone who is 200 pounds overweight who can't do a pull-up because that's a huge
00:02:01 liability I'm not even sure if there are strength standards and civilian the final scenario where strength
00:02:18 standards matter is maybe in medical practice I think that all doctors should be able to deadlift 405 pounds I'm just kidding
00:02:26 take this with a grain of salt I know I should stay in my lane but here we go at the barbell medicine seminars Austin
00:02:34 Brock he talks about a brief informal screening tool that he uses with some patients and I think it's pretty cool
00:02:40 so if a patient looks like it might be sarcopenia or maybe they're on the verge of completely losing their physical
00:02:46 independence Austin will have them perform a few sit to stands which is just asking them to get up out of their
00:02:52 chair and sit back down for a few repetitions if they can not do a given number of reps in a time period or they
00:03:00 can't get up out of their chair without using their arms or maybe they're even too weak to get up out of their chair
00:03:05 without someone else's assistance Austin can pretty confidently say that they almost completely lack mobility and
00:03:11 physical independence and when I say mobility I don't mean lacrosse ball a foam roller I actually mean your ability
00:03:17 to be mobile your ability to move so if Austin was to suggest that anyone over the age of 60 years old really any age
00:03:25 should be able to do five to six sit to stands in 30 seconds or less I'm making these numbers up I think that that is a
00:03:31 meaningful strength standard that could be used for physical therapists personal trainers and physicians
00:03:47 now let's move on to what I call internet strength standards classify a novice intermediate and advanced lifters
00:03:54 based off of strength standards is drawn don't meet useless made-up befuddling novice lifters squat less than 200
00:04:03 pounds intermediate lifters squat 2 to 400 pounds advanced lifters squat over 400 pounds I've worked with people who
00:04:10 can't squat the empty barbell on day one and I've worked with people who rep 315 pounds on day one just because someone
00:04:17 is never trained with a barbell doesn't mean they're completely untrained further classifying you as a novice
00:04:23 intermediate and advanced lifter even without strength standards is just unhelpful I would rather program based
00:04:29 on your physical activity experience than your barbell numbers or your experience with barbell training case in
00:04:36 points let's say a professional rugby player comes to me for strength training and he's never touched a barbell before
00:04:43 never even touched weights and at the same time a 35 year old guy who has never done anything physically active in
00:04:48 his entire life comes to me for barbell training prescribing the same program is dumb
00:04:55 they will both respond differently to that same program I'm 32 years old I'm 5 foot 8 inches tall
00:05:03 I weigh 165 pounds how much weight should I be lifting what's a realistic goal for me I'll usually respond you
00:05:09 should be squatting a thousand pounds because my answer doesn't really even matter it's impossible for me to predict
00:05:16 what you're capable of and does it really even matter what I think you can do here's michael say at us apo raw
00:05:26 Nationals squatting 280 7.5 kilos that's 633 pounds at 74 kilos body weight that's 163 pounds I'm assuming there are
00:05:35 165 pound individuals out there who struggle to squat the empty barbell so my point is that there is this huge
00:05:42 variability and strength potential I had a football coach you would say shoot for the moon because even if you fall short
00:05:48 you'll still land in a star I know that he didn't make that up but he would say it a lot
00:05:53 so shoot for a 500-pound bench press because even if he falls short having a 450 pound bench is still pretty cool and
00:05:59 let's say that I did tell you that you should be benching 300 pounds when you do get 300 pounds then what are you
00:06:05 gonna maintain that 300 pound bench for the rest of your life you're probably gonna want to do 305 310 315 300 for 2
00:06:13 reps if you're the type of person who strives to reach a goal I promise that once you reach it you're gonna set
00:06:20 another goal DIY deadlift Jackie your squats should be X percent of your deadlift your overhead press should be X
00:06:34 percent of your bench my deadlifts the same as my squat what's wrong with me let's use a deadlift for example because
00:06:39 I find most people concerned with their deadlift to squat ratio most often yes most people deadlift more than they
00:06:47 squat some a lot more but it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you just because your deadlift is the same
00:06:52 or even less than your squat here's Ray Williams 1080 pound squat 878 pound deadlift Andre Milano Chet 1069
00:07:06 pound squat 893 pound deadlift I wouldn't classify them as dysfunctional or disproportionate and I wouldn't ask
00:07:13 them why their deadlift sucks there are a few reasons why your deadlifts might be the same or less than your squat you
00:07:19 could be a short stocky individual with a big front porch and stubby little arms the squat might just come easier for you
00:07:26 than a deadlift your training history a lot of times athletes have been squatting for a long time and they've
00:07:31 never really dead lifted so their deadlift is just less trained than their squat this was me personally your mental
00:07:37 approach could impact your numbers as well you might love squatting hate deadlift II always hyped for a heavy
00:07:44 squat always flat when it's time to pull a heavy single on dead but as far as overhead press percentage of your bench
00:07:50 this one's pretty popular it doesn't matter you're gonna get good at what you practice and even if I did say that your
00:07:56 press percentage of your bench is too low what are you gonna do about it train your press and not train your
00:08:01 bench just to have those numbers be closer lastly strength standards based off of body weight is also made up I'll admit
00:08:10 that it's cooled out of these goals overhead pressing my body weight front squatting two times my body weight dead
00:08:15 lifting three times my body weight these are all goals that have meaning to me but they're completely arbitrary outside
00:08:21 of powerlifting where you're scored off of wilkes body weight to strength ratio is just an Internet strength standard so
00:08:28 for those of you worried about strength standards and strength ratios I'm gonna quote the great Austin Baraka have you
00:08:35 tried just caring less thanks for tuning in my strongman competition is December 7th here on same
00:08:45 strength not hosting it but I'm competing it's booked so you can't sign up but it's open to
00:08:52 spectators so it's going to come watch the Battle of the two 20s come check it out thanks for tuning in
00:08:57 I'll see in the next training blog always remember I love you guys will say man I wish I could train an untamed
00:09:06 strength because you guys play good music my gym just plays pop and rap crap trust me we play a lot of that too this
00:09:14 isn't just my gym this is also the members gym and if they want to listen to something other than metal they can
00:09:21 so if you ever get a chance to come out and train an untamed strength and you walk through those doors in here give
