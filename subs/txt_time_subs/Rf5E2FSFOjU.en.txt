00:00:07 before modern telescopes humans could only imagine what the surface of the sun
00:00:14 and the planets look like now advanced technology has made it possible to get in close and take images of the sun
00:00:21 and the planets deep in our solar system now get ready to see the solar system as you've never seen it before
00:00:28 and see images that were so good they burning with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second
00:00:44 the sun is the largest body in our solar system accounting for 99.86 percent of the total mass
00:00:51 one of the most dramatic images of the sun was captured by the solar dynamics observatory on august the 31st 2012 when a long
00:00:59 filament of solar material that had been hovering in the sun's atmosphere erupted into outer space this beautiful
00:01:07 but deadly coronal mass ejection cme traveled at over 900 miles per second the planet closest to the sun orbiting
00:01:17 at an average distance of 36 million miles mercury has been studied by many spacecraft throughout the years
00:01:24 but nasa's messenger spacecraft was the first to orbit the planet images showed the surface covered in
00:01:29 craters in all sizes and massive asteroid impact sites like the van ick crater which is 168 miles in diameter
00:01:39 and the caloris basin which is 960 miles in diameter with mountains at the outer rim 1.2
00:01:44 miles high these are images with spectral surface measurements that were taken
00:01:52 on april the 29th 2015. messenger snapped more than 200 000 images of mercury before ending its mission in 2015
00:01:59 with an intentional crash into the planet's surface the probe's demise was inevitable as
00:02:04 messenger had been orbiting mercury since march 2011 and had run out of fuel right before
00:02:10 impact it sent back its final image the highest resolution photo of mercury ever captured
00:02:15 you'd think that mercury would be the hottest planet because it's the closest to the sun
00:02:20 but our next planet is actually the the second planet from the sun and also earth's closest neighboring planet
00:02:31 venus has a thick atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide and nitrogen gas which
00:02:37 traps the heat of the sun making it a hellish world venera 13 was a probe built in the soviet union for
00:02:44 the venera program to explore venus it was the first lander to transmit color images from the
00:02:50 surface of venus venus is a hot world with surface temperatures as high as 880 degrees fahrenheit
00:02:59 the probe was designed to only last 30 minutes but it must have been built like a tank because it continued to transmit data
00:03:05 and images for more than two hours after landing on march the 1st 1982 nasa then sent the magalan
00:03:13 spacecraft to venus in 1990 to image and map the entire surface it sent back images of the planet's surface
00:03:19 showing evidence of volcanism tectonic plate movement turbulent surface winds and miles of
00:03:24 lava channels including one measuring 5 550 miles long another incredible image of the volcano
00:03:33 mat mons that rises three miles once magellan was finished mapping the entire surface
00:03:39 it also ended its mission and crashed the third rock from the sun the earth is very unique
00:03:48 and the only place known to have life in the solar system there have been lots of amazing images
00:03:53 taken of the planet we live on but modern satellite photos are probably the most breathtaking
00:03:59 like this image from nasa of the earth as it looks right now this amazing true color image was taken
00:04:04 by nasa's moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer from 22
00:04:12 north and south america as they appear from orbit the moon also making a guest appearance in the background
00:04:19 and on december the 14th 2020 nasa captured a total solar eclipse with the goes 16. that's quite amazing but here is
00:04:27 something you may not have seen in march 2011 a russian satellite named electro l captured incredibly detailed images of
00:04:35 the earth that appear to rival nasa images many claimed that they are more accurate and show different things
00:04:42 but nasa say they're not accurate we're not sure but which images do you think are the
00:04:46 best and by the way remember the messenger spacecraft it snapped a photo of the earth and of the moon
00:04:52 and sent as a postcard before speeding towards mercury mars has always been of great interest
00:04:57 to humans the fourth planet from the sun the red martian planet has been studied heavily
00:05:04 the viking orbiter 1 took stunning snapshots of mars in 1979 like this photo of the valles marineris
00:05:12 and the viking 2 orbiter snapped an image showing the southern polar plains and polar ice cap in 2013 the mars
00:05:20 european space agency's mars express took highly detailed images of hebes khasma
00:05:25 the northernmost part of valles marineris as seen in this movie created from the images
00:05:32 but since then four rovers have already been on the planet's surface studying and snapping photos the images
00:05:37 from the mars curiosity rover including a selfie were the most incredible images from the
00:05:43 surface of an alien world this is a 1.8 billion paranamic view made up of over 1200
00:05:51 images of mars as seen by curiosity which is still operational the largest planet in our solar system
00:06:00 the gas giant jupiter has the most unique look of all the planets with its giant great red spot
00:06:07 a storm on the planet that's been raging for 350 years and is so large it could swallow the
00:06:12 earth whole on july 10 2017 the juno spacecraft flew just 5 600 miles above the great
00:06:19 red spot and nabbed the closest image of the massive storm ever taken
00:06:26 this image a bit farther away is a little bit truer in color to what we would see if we were orbiting jupiter
00:06:32 but juno also captured unbelievable images of polar regions which cannot be seen from earth and what
00:06:38 surprised astronomers was that jupiter's north pole has eight storms swirling at its center and
00:06:43 they're laid out in a precise geometric pattern the storms appearing as stable fixtures in jupiter's atmosphere
00:06:51 and not normal weather but more incredible photos would come and on november 13 2018 a new image from
00:06:57 juno was created using data from the juno cam imager that's nothing short of
00:07:03 breathtaking and on june 27 2019 the hubble telescope captured the planet's trademark
00:07:09 great red spot which researchers say is shrinking we got an awesome video coming up on jupiter so make sure not to miss it
00:07:17 as the number one contender for the most beautiful celestial body in the solar system saturn is hard to beat with its iconic rings
00:07:26 and probably the best images of saturn to date come from the cassini higgins spacecraft on october 21st 2002 the spacecraft was
00:07:36 177 million miles away from saturn when it snapped this photo and on march the 27th 2004
00:07:44 as it got closer took this natural color image as it neared its arrival into saturn's orbit
00:07:49 now here's a mind-blowing image of saturn you may never have seen before this is saturn backlit by the sun and
00:07:54 with that added light cassini was able to image the ring system in a way not
00:08:00 possible from earth and the result is stunning but in 2004 the hubble telescope was also in on the action
00:08:07 and snapped an amazing photo of an aura in 2016 the cassini spacecraft sent back images of saturn's northern hemisphere
00:08:14 what scientists were surprised to see was a hexagonal vortex storms they've been studied but no one's sure
00:08:20 how this forms on september 15 2017 the spacecraft made its final approach towards the gas giant
00:08:28 and before sending this final image burned up in saturn's atmosphere like a meteor known as the sideways
00:08:36 planet because it rotates on its side the seventh planet from the sun one of the best images taken
00:08:43 voyager 2 made a flyby of the planet in 1999 and this image was taken using three color filters
00:08:51 and on july the 11th and 12th 2004 a composite image of uranus obtained by the keck telescope was published showing
00:08:57 the icy cold world and its rings those bright spots that you see on the surface of the planet are auras
00:09:05 in november of 2011 the hubble telescope snapped an awesome image of uranus and a colorized photo
00:09:12 shows an icy blue sphere with red rings and in 2017 the hubble telescope captured auras again
00:09:21 neptune is the eighth planet in our solar system and the farthest away from the sun the
00:09:27 only spacecraft that's being close to neptune is voyager 2. one image taken by the spacecraft shows
00:09:33 a giant storm ranging on the surface of the planet neptune's great dark spot before voyager
00:09:38 2 would complete its mission and head towards interstellar space it made a close approach
00:09:44 and snapped this image showing bright cloud streaks in neptune's atmosphere the hubble telescope has taken a recent
00:09:51 image of neptune and in december 2020 snapped this image with the great dark spot because it's so far away from us the
00:09:58 best images we have of neptune from earth so far was taken by the european southern observatory's
00:10:04 very large telescope using a special narrow field adaptive optics mode of the multi-unit
00:10:11 spectroscopic explorer instrument many argue whether pluto is a planet or not but you're here to see some photos
00:10:18 one of the clearest images of pluto that you'll ever see was taken by the long range reconnaissance imager
00:10:23 which is aboard nasa's new horizons spacecraft on july the 13th 2015 but it wasn't done yet and on the
00:10:29 next day this image was put together by combining blue red and
00:10:35 infrared images taken by the spacecraft the new horizon spacecraft continued to take crystal clear images of the planet
00:10:42 pluto also has a moon called charon as seen in this composite of enhanced color images and this image
00:10:48 is the most striking humanity has achieved great results getting new images from planets in our
00:10:57 solar system and making incredible discoveries we're still too far away to get close images
00:11:03 of proxima centrai the next planetary system to ours and current spacecraft headed in that direction
00:11:09 will take thousands of years to get there but there are plans to create a wafer thin
00:11:15 nano probe called breakthrough star shot that has thin sails to capture energy from a
00:11:20 powerful earth-based laser this would accelerate the probe at 134 million miles per hour
00:11:26 meaning the tiny probes could reach proxima centauri in 20-25 years just think of the images it could take
00:11:33 if that happens sometime soon you'll see it here our friends over at channel perception
