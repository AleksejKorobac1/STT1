00:00:10 half in the bag what I was just thinking we haven't seen a movie in a while that's right
00:00:18 last thing we did was Jurassic world it made fifty billion dollars ensuring that there'll be many more sequels to come I
00:00:26 can't wait yeah it's interesting Deadpool 2 came out we didn't see it it had a 97% Rotten Tomatoes score and I
00:00:33 was like you know what that's probably just as good as the first one maybe even better I bet you that's a really funny
00:00:41 film and then Ant Man and the wasp came out and that got a very positive Rotten Tomatoes score as well and I'm sure it
00:00:47 was pretty good I heard it was it was good so this is this is a new trend what we're trying to set up here is that
00:00:54 there's this new trends and maybe it's just us I don't know is this being cynical perhaps but this idea that it
00:01:01 used to be you would not go see a movie because the trailer made it look bad and the new trend is you don't go see a
00:01:07 movie because the trailer makes it look fine well that's probably pretty good I feel like I've seen it well that's
00:01:14 that's the perfect example though is is that Ant Man and the wasp and Deadpool both had predecessors that were good so
00:01:22 it's not like a movie comes out that has a really high rating and it looks good but there's no movie before it ya know
00:01:29 Audient no pre-established audience or yeah it's like saying I will do you want to watch Deadpool again yeah Deadpool it
00:01:38 was good there's some sequels I'm genuinely excited for but then there's others or it's like Ant Man was fine
00:01:43 Deadpool was pretty good but in both cases I don't need more right but  yeah so because we haven't seen any
00:01:50 movies and have no interest in seeing movies we're gonna talk about comic-con trailers yeah cuz we just got back from
00:02:06 we were there we had a move and everything so if you missed us you know so we'll see you next time I guess right
00:02:13 oh yeah we'll be back every year yep definitely we love going to cons here's oh yeah these trailers they they kind of
00:02:26 are a glimpse into what is going on overall in Hollywood I think yes yes certain certain studios or franchises so
00:02:32 we're gonna kind of talk about that stuff I guess yeah it's interesting like the San Diego comic-con it's just a big
00:02:42 movie advertisement festival it's a way to funnel a bunch of people into an auditorium to watch their commercial
00:02:49 I've heard the the San Diego comic-con described like in comparison to other conventions I've heard it described like
00:02:57 what's the word nightmare okay and it was oh yeah it was I had claustrophobia issues I started
00:03:04 vomiting I fell down a couple times I got trampled on the way to the the Teen Titans go trailer or these someone
00:03:15 stepped on my face i shat my pants an ambulance came but it couldn't get to me so they just they said forget him he's
00:03:23 gone it was really uncomfortable see you your pants out of fear but most of the people that are at the convention
00:03:28 they just do it because they're lazy there's where adult diapers so get out of there cosplay
00:03:33 right I I didn't have a chance to see any of the trailers so when I got home I was like oh my god
00:03:38 nine trailers came out oh there's a trailer for this a trailer for that it's almost like oversaturation yes these
00:03:44 trailers like sporadically so that each one can get the individual attention it deserves but when there's 12 at one time
00:03:51 I lost track as always discovery season 2 trailer oh my god this came oh my god isn't and so we sat down we we sat on a
00:04:01 little loveseat together we turned on all these trailers we turned the lights down low and we held hands and we watch
00:04:08 them all and jot it down some notes and we're going to talk about them today for you our home audience well we should
00:04:15 point out that we showed all these trailers that were going to discuss to our friend rich Evans who we'd like to
00:04:22 introduce you to he's never been in any of our programs no I don't know no but he's a friend of ours and we showed him
00:04:28 all these trailers so we could gauge his very enthusiastic reaction to yes so every now and then we'll be showing you
00:04:32 some of Rich's reactions well one of the trailers that that was premiered at San Diego comic-con was for
00:04:47 the Clone Wars do you remember Star Wars I do sort of it's weird this this is this trailer and
00:04:55 then the two DC movie trailers I kind of like lump them together in that their franchises that everybody's kind of done
00:05:01 with everybody's sick of them they've been turned off by them so now to release trailers like it I can't imagine
00:05:07 anyone being hyped anymore the only people are still hyped for these franchises or like weirdos so I don't
00:05:14 know anything about Clone Wars I never watched the cartoon but it looks like that's Juba they're bringing her back
00:05:27 she that's the I forget the character's name she has got the tentacles on her head but I think this is did it say
00:05:34 season 7 I don't know I don't think I feel like the show kind of went away for a while and other great did it went away
00:05:39 and then they they had a show called Star Wars rebels I think yeah Lucasfilm is in full-on how can we salvage this
00:05:46 disaster you've got more of more favorite characters yeah as opposed to rebels which I don't know who was in
00:05:55 that there was a bunch of weirdos but you got favorite characters you know yeah you're Darth Vader
00:06:01 you're Yoda you're obi-wan Kenobi you're Emperor Palpatine I wonder who if this is a revival I
00:06:08 wonder if they'll have the same guy do the voice run for Emperor Palpatine maybe he's busy maybe he's busy they
00:06:13 should they should maybe look into getting someone new to do it well I saw a graphic on the internet of six Star
00:06:21 Wars related things like coming out in 2019 and I was what is this fake well it seems to be and I don't know what's
00:06:27 going on in the world anymore I'm elderly I feel like they're gonna scale it back now after less Jedi and then
00:06:33 especially after solo flob why what's wrong with the last Jetta you hate women absolutely but that movie was obviously
00:06:39 very divisive because of that nobody went to see solo you think that was a direct result wow this is shocking
00:06:46 opinion I think it's related I'm not saying it's completely it I think people just don't care about solo and that's a
00:06:51 big problem like that movie specifically but I there's definitely a low point in interest for Star Wars
00:06:58 but they just seem to have like no plan and they're just throwing everything out there like Ryan Johnson's gonna get a
00:07:03 trilogy even though that probably won't happen now but that and then Jon Favreau is getting a TV show or another channel
00:07:10 yeah that was one of the things that was on there yeah just like all these things that they
00:07:14 just keep throwing out you know it's a good analogy white trash winning the lottery here white trash here's a
00:07:25 hundred million dollars oh gee whiz I'm gonna buy a mansion and a car and we're gonna I'm gonna buy a mansion I'm gonna
00:07:31 give us a hundred ten million dollars to my brother Cletus I'm gonna buy this oh oh oh you have to pay taxes on that oh
00:07:39 you you can't do that because you have to maintain upkeep on on owning fifteen horses and that costs you know 100 grand
00:07:49 a year for ah went bankrupt yeah you know what I mean where that that level of success was just dumped in the lap of
00:07:58 somebody kind of like with Marvel they start with Iron Man yeah a little tease for The Avengers at the end of that but
00:08:04 if they never went any further than that movie it just works as a little t-shirt sure but fine you they built up their
00:08:11 empire with Star Wars they just no pun intended George Lucas George Lucas got a check for four billion dollars and he
00:08:19 said here have fun now he's a smart man he knows when to make his decisions he knew when to when to say hey let me have
00:08:28 those toy rights but just give me the toy rights he knows when to make his move and he knew like you guys take this
00:08:39 it's done he saw the writing on the wall for all the heat George Lucas takes he is a smart smart man who knows when to
00:08:47 move his pieces on the chessboard and he but yeah not his fault that they they took it and just immediately
00:08:58 oversaturated it well it's again my analogy is you have this property that you're drooling yeah you're literally
00:09:05 drooling like of all the things we can do with this how much parts like someone who you know
00:09:12 it lives in a trailer park and is handed a hundred million dollars that person doesn't go well I've been investor for
00:09:19 the next ten years I'm just gonna buy a night I'm gonna buy like a Prius and move into a one-bedroom condo and then
00:09:26 I'm gonna take my money and you know that's what that's what Disney did yeah I'm known for my analogies Jay I'm
00:09:42 famous for my analogies remember they take more screenshots of this you anyways let's move on okay I
00:09:57 don't want to talk about Star Wars all day we have to talk about the rest of these boring ass trailers well let's
00:10:02 talk about another franchise that people are sick of which is the DC Cinematic Universe we have two trailers for movies
00:10:09 and one trailer for a TV show I don't think any of them are connected to anything it seems like DC is kind of
00:10:16 like stepping back from the whole Cinematic Universe thing because it's listen to come aboard first trailer was Aquaman
00:10:31 everybody's favorite superhero it's so weird that they're still like like I can see them after like Justice League I
00:10:36 think this is probably already in production which is part of the problem but cuz I can see them after Justice
00:10:41 League being like alright let's just stop let's make some standalone movies but they won't be connected at all but
00:10:47 we still have Jason Momoa playing Aquaman my father was a lighthouse keeper my mother was Queen when I first heard
00:10:56 the voiceover commitment from Jason Momoa I was like this doesn't sound that great it sounds kind of like like a it
00:11:04 sounded like a b-movie like a red like as acting or exactly exacting isn't the greatest you know he does fine but then
00:11:10 I saw the trailer I was like it looks like it could very well be the most expensive movie ever made which kind of
00:11:17 surprised me that they're still dumping so much money into these things I mean it looked like avatar to a lot of it was
00:11:24 reminiscent of the underwater Gungan cities from the Phantom Menace but they had like people riding sharks and like
00:11:31 laser blasts going off and it made it looked like very very complex yeah and the effects didn't look super cheap
00:11:37 either no and that was like I was like okay it looked more intricate and more grandeur and scope than the Justice
00:11:45 League film was yes those are putting all your eggs in this basket another interesting note is that James
00:12:00 Wan is directing he's the head of the conjuring Cinematic Universe there's a lot of horror stuff but he's directing
00:12:08 this and I mean when I say directing I'm gonna put it in quotation marks because I'm gonna assume it's it's similar to
00:12:13 Spielberg directing ready player one where James Wan comes on sentences pets Jason Momoa on the back says look the
00:12:20 scene you're wet and you say he's in front of a green screen get him they went thattaway
00:12:25 and then he turns the the half day of filming over 2000 visual effects artists the VFX like supervisor like directs the
00:12:35 scene and the james wan goes out and has a cigarette that reminds me I finally watched ready player one and I remember
00:12:40 you you talking about that how it feels like Spielberg shot for like two days and I'm watching the movie and I'm like
00:12:46 those cute I guess but visually it's way too busy and then there was a certain part of the movie you were I was like I
00:12:51 kind of like this stuff and then I realized it was because it was real it's when he meets up with all of his
00:12:57 character friends in the real worlds and they're like getting chased in a van it's like this feels like a Spielberg
00:13:01 movie though because this is actually real this is a Spielberg part because this is a part that he actually shot
00:13:09 yeah but yeah similar to the the Aquaman movie where it's just like it might as well be an animated film the war is
00:13:15 coming to the surface and I'm bringing the wrath of the seven seas with me Mike how about that plot
00:13:25 brother is evil and wants to take over the world acha bad you have to stop them so Loki
00:13:33 comes it's not Loki Mike Aquaman's this is a completely different character different story
00:13:38 who's coming in what's your part for Aquaman we got this whole society that lives under the ocean and then a bad guy
00:13:45 what's that bad guy want to do something clever something interesting no control the world he wants to take over the
00:13:52 upside it's like it's like The Little Mermaid where were told Mermaid was just she had legs mm-hmm Aquaman wishes
00:14:03 oh he has legs he's fine he's normal are you saying people with a lower half that's a fish or at normal Jay okay hey
00:14:19 Aquaman what's interesting though is that trailer as like as recording this I think it is like 27 million views or
00:14:26 something like it's got a ton of views but the next trailer we're gonna talk about Shazam which looks like a far more
00:14:33 entertaining movie has like less than half of that I'm hoping Shazam as a sleeper hit I'm hoping so too because
00:14:45 it's well it looks dumb I'm gonna say that it looks entertainingly dumb it reminds me of
00:14:49 like a 90s movie yeah where they have like just the stupidest premise but they're like yeah whatever and they just
00:14:54 kind of have fun with it like it looks like that I think the reason being for this this discrepancy obviously is your
00:15:04 DC fans I think for the most part will probably say Aquaman looks badass because Jason Momoa looks like a
00:15:11 wrestler and he's all tatted up and there's a lot of talking about the the release the Snyder cut type weirdos yes
00:15:20 yes they're weirdos you say well look at the look at how I'll come out originally look like you're like nobody's badass
00:15:26 now he looks like Dogma that you see that Shazam suit and it looks like comical yes and
00:15:33 that's the the DC fans don't work in that like creative witty fun kind of like mindset yeah I mean I'm speaking in
00:15:42 generalizations but that's just my opinion that's more of a Marvel type type movie so yeah I can see why it has a disparity
00:15:52 of views and that white wouldn't appeal to DC fans okay Shazam he said the thing he said the thing
00:16:04 maybe it'll cross over maybe it'll appeal to a general audience well that's what DC needs to do clearly I think
00:16:09 that's what they're trying to do now tell us more about Shazam well it's directed by her friend David
00:16:17 enough Sandberg oh yeah we've on his movies before I like him though as a person he seems like he has a YouTube
00:16:24 channel he makes like horror shorts and they're entertaining yeah behind the scenes thing seems like a good guy he
00:16:30 seems like a very nice guy good sense of humor about stuff and and we had a bit of a controversy back with Annabel
00:16:38 creation yes with him in a contest what was it with him it was with the studio yeah but he was promoting it he
00:16:42 didn't know you know you can't fault him right he's like you got to do this you got to do that for your movie and he's
00:16:48 probably okay okay sure yeah so it's not his fault really were just gonna say that because I think he got a little bit
00:16:54 of backlash about that it's clear clearly the villain at the center of this story is the lawyer who wrote that
00:17:01 contract for Warner Brothers pictures not David F Sandberg leave the guy alone yeah he didn't make the contest but yeah
00:17:10 he lights out I think was a pretty good movie that was okay we didn't like Annabel creation and then I don't know
00:17:18 why they picked it like horror guy to do this like this Sandberg it might be a case of like and this is a growing trend
00:17:24 too which is where he take a director who's made like a smaller budget movie and they've shown that they're competent
00:17:30 so then you scoop them up and immediately give them a two hundred million dollar movie because one they're
00:17:37 not a big enough name established director where they're gonna cause any make any waves cause any problems
00:17:42 they're gonna do what you say but they're clearly competent enough to put a movie together
00:17:46 as they've shown with their little no budget thing yeah it's like you're you're Colin Trevorrow doing Jurassic
00:17:52 worlds and there's tons of examples yeah I'm sure David F Sandberg is is the guy you get when you say here's your
00:17:58 script you know follow it by the numbers make it make it you know we don't have to pay you
00:18:04 Spielberg salary yeah it's just a job and it looks like from the trailer he's done it well it looks like some fun
00:18:11 movie it looks silly which is like I'll take it at this point I'll take it yeah out of all the trailers that we've
00:18:16 watched it's the one I'm the most interested in to be honest because everything else oh god another like this
00:18:24 and other that and that's like Sam oh that looks like fun is the average kid gets powers from space yeah it doesn't
00:18:41 it doesn't feel like every like like Aquaman I keep comparing it to a Marvel movie because it just feels like an
00:18:47 attempt to make it Marvel movie and the Shazam movie feels at least like it has a little bit of a unique kind of rattle
00:18:52 to it with the idea that he's actually a little kid like yeah it's completely silly yeah and and it's refreshing to
00:19:01 see the goofy costume yes where it's not you know the the DC like they they knew Shazam was a silly thing and they
00:19:08 they're not going to make dark muted colors Shazam Shazam no one would take it seriously people would laugh at it
00:19:15 much like another trailer we're going to but let's let's transition into the polar opposite of shazam which is the
00:19:32 laughingstock of the internet right now the Titans trail yes so just not for a movie is for Siri series this is like I
00:19:50 mean clearly with Aquaman and the Shazam movie it's DC being like all right we got to lighten things up people didn't
00:19:57 like dark gritty we ourself with Justice League by trying to take a dark gritty movie and making it
00:20:04 not that in you know reshoots and stuff but I guess they still haven't learned what it looks cheap it feels like a fan
00:20:21 film I mean like okay I sat down yeah I was like what is Titans because I'm elderly I'm like what I like is that
00:20:29 Teen Titans go is that that cartoon show Beast Boy and and currently popular cartoon series yeah I was like what and
00:20:36 then I watch it and then you said it looks like a fan film halfway through I was like is this a movie or this looks
00:20:43 like a TV show and then it was like a new series Oh TV show okay that makes sense it looks like the quality of a TV show
00:20:51 but yeah well it's weird because like up until now the DC movies have been like and the DC related TV series have been
00:21:08 better received like there's the flash TV show and I know they have a couple other ones and those I guess I've never
00:21:14 watched any of them but I guess those are a little more like light-hearted and fun and so now they're just doing the
00:21:19 inverse of that or they're trying to make the movies fun and the TV show dark why maybe they're just throwing whatever
00:21:26 at the wall to see what sticks like movies in the theaters are dark and gritty and maybe they think oh that
00:21:32 would work better for TV well that would be a lesson they learned from Marvel then because the the Marvel Netflix TV
00:21:37 shows like the your Jessica Jones and Luke Cage those are darker and the theatrical movies are a little more
00:21:43 lighthearted for the most part they're following suit and that makes sense because the titan TV shows dark and
00:21:49 gritty and then you got your Sam yeah I think Shazam is there is there a Dark Horse is there their secret weapon
00:21:56 yeah because they got David F Sandberg and then they got bunch of unknown actors it looks fairly low-budget they
00:22:06 probably spent 12 million on it maybe they're they're putting all their money on this one bet yeah come on in that
00:22:13 roulette wheel if it fails we didn't spend a lot on us but if it's a big hit if it's like like like everyone thinks
00:22:20 it's hilarious and everyone goes then they've recoup tall her losses for the Justice League movie for every other
00:22:27 film all on Shazam yeah that David Samberg gets crowned king of the world by James Cameron
00:22:45 you saved the company oh the kids are all gonna want to see this it's not like they're making entertainment anymore
00:22:54 it's just placing bets roulette table well speaking of tonal shifts let's talk about the season 2 trailer for Star Trek
00:23:29 discovery the secret made of spacing time to receive it pike Spock there's that or dredging them up yeah
00:23:45 this opens with nonsensical lines those those those classy nonsensical weighty lines the universe police filled with secrets
00:23:56 something blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I have no idea what you're talking about
00:24:01 cut to Christopher Pike remember me remember Spock and then it's here's your premise so then they say seven glowing
00:24:13 red lights and galaxy means something Spock somehow they're connected Spock what cue lenny kravitz music just shots
00:24:29 of things is happening a bunch of action so you really don't get a good sense of what's gonna happen but there is a
00:24:39 notable insertion of more levity excuse okay well I was gonna say there's like a tag at the end after they said show the
00:24:51 the logo yeah with them all like in an elevator and for a second I thought I was watching an ad for the Orval it's
00:25:00 like is this the order it's a Star Trek right some of the creature sneezes on somebody yeah it's like an awkward thing
00:25:07 in an elevator yeah throughout the the show like they had some bit where the there were two like female Helms in
00:25:12 there like come on ladies get it together they're like oh sorry and then the one girl
00:25:25 Tillie yells science science is great she yells OH what is she I wrote it down oh I think she yelled Batman
00:25:41 she yells oh I didn't write it down you know it's like it's like the first season went through one through the ringer
00:25:58 they went through the ringer of market research fans said it's a little too dark tough stuff a little too seriously
00:26:09 fans like the Orville war let's have a scene image don't we make Star Trek more like the Orville or a show that is
00:26:15 ripping off Star Trek yeah so let's have a creature in an elevator its knees in fart and let's have a couple of funny
00:26:22 lines yeah lighten it up with the music so it's okay we're doing the Star Trek thing remember those weighty lines in the
00:26:30 beginning space is a place of dark secrets and mysteries I want to get away science is awesome you we're
00:26:49 fine more serious yeah well it's gonna be fine it's serious why are pop songs such a part of the Star Trek universe
00:26:57 now because times have changed my friend yes look we got Godzilla king of the monsters this is a life-size prop of
00:27:19 Godzilla look what is the scale ratio to that like how big is a human compared to this no you know when you buy a model
00:27:28 kit oh yeah this is one to one oh they I I don't like the color palette of this film but I think the movie itself looks
00:27:45 good I like Michael Dougherty the director of it he didn't he did a half in the bag favorite Krampus Graff years
00:27:51 ago Krampus is great I love trick-or-treat the movie did before that doesn't one actually has some monsters
00:27:57 in it unlike the last Godzilla movie or Godzilla was in it for five seconds on a TV screen I want to see it for Bryan
00:28:03 Cranston again they got rid of him immediately got stepped on him yeah by Godzilla now J let's talk about cannon
00:28:20 and universes so we had Godzilla well let's take it back a little I mean we you know you had your Shoji Tabuchi
00:28:29 Godzilla's from way back in the day yes is that what they're called shoujo Toho showed you Tabuchi Godzilla's yes from
00:28:38 back in the day there's somewhat recently there was Shin Godzilla but that's a-ok that's that's not an
00:28:43 American okay but then so then you have godzilla with bryan cranston yes and then now we have godzilla king of
00:28:52 monsters which is not a sequel to the bryan cranston one it is technically i don't think it's gonna have much of a
00:28:58 connection to it but it is supposed to be in the same sort of timeline as that okay which is also in the same universe
00:29:07 as Kong Skull Islands okay which is why they made Kong so much bigger in that movie than he's ever been in any other
00:29:12 iteration because they need to make him large enough to fight Godzilla and the eventual team up movie because that's
00:29:19 how movies exist now yes because there is a movie coming up called Godzilla vs. King Kong well they won't be called that
00:29:26 but whatever it's called yeah it's a by Adam Wingard yes and so that's in that universe yes
00:29:33 okay okay I'm following my question is is if this Godzilla king of the monsters tanks how will that affect Godzilla vs. Kong
00:29:42 well it'll be a DC situation where that movies already in production so you can't can't slow the train down now yeah
00:29:48 and that's something I will I'm just mentioned real quick I am NOT a huge Godzilla person it's just something
00:30:02 that doesn't entirely interest me yeah my interest in this one is more based on the director than any sort of attachment
00:30:08 to the Godzilla franchise okay mostly kay he's got to get this out of the way so we can finally make trick-or-treat -
00:30:14 he's been talking about that for like a decade get to it god damn it don't through these big cash grab movies
00:30:20 do a little bunch of movie that won't make any money do it for Jay why won't anyone think of
00:30:29 me let us sell out make trick-or-treat - for Jay I'll do a Kickstarter for a our last film is called glass this is
00:30:55 the headline if the movies bad the headlines already write themselves just take out the G in this movie take out
00:31:02 the G in the L this movie's ass no no no J this movie will do well and the headlines will be glass shatters
00:31:10 box-office records are young they're already printed listen the movie already came out it was okay I specialize in
00:31:19 those individuals who believe they are superheroes no I I mean this is unless they I can't really see this movie just
00:31:33 like flopping it's got such a great foundation already unbreakable and split yes it's weird it's a concept which is
00:31:42 fascinating to me cuz it's so different unbreakable right interesting concept Wow pasta one of my favorite M night
00:31:52 Shyamalan movies yeah Mila a realistic take on superheroes right and then 40 years go by and then he comes out with a
00:32:00 movie called split and M night jumble M is known for his twist endings and his last eight films were crap with the
00:32:09 exception of escaped elderly insane asylum patients posing as someone's grandparents which was mildly
00:32:15 interesting now I did feature scene where an elderly man shoves his used diaper into a kid's face there are some
00:32:21 fun moments that was like an exploitation film oh yeah it was it was goofy  but then split comes out you're
00:32:29 like okay split personality I get it James professor X is is a great actor and he does great voices and you know I can do
00:32:44 these great characters and he's always got split personalities gonna be scary and then oh my god it's in the Bruce
00:32:50 Willis unbreakable universe yeah well even before that cuz that's not literally a twist of the story that's
00:32:55 just like a tag at the end but even before that you go into the movie like oh he's got split personalities he's
00:32:59 gonna be creepy and weird but then you realize like depending on what personality he's in he can like
00:33:04 physically change the body like it gets really bizarre and that's that's acceptable in the logic of like a horror
00:33:10 movie yeah that was okay with that but the twist really but then but then Bruce Willis shows up at the end and if you
00:33:15 went in not knowing that was going to happen it's like holy like Shyamalan actually pulled something
00:33:21 interesting off again he pulled the twist off again yeah which was unexpected ironically
00:33:27 alright then this this trailer is like okay they got Sam Jackson back they got Bruce Willis James mmm-hmm
00:33:36 I wants a Mangold but but that's a direct that is a director I want to say maraschino as in the cherry too much
00:33:47 grease glass of grease Godzilla sure James McAvoy you did it you did it  he's in there too and then you have
00:33:58 Sarah Paulsen's in and she's the the like a therapist and she's like I specialize in weirdos who think
00:34:04 they're superheroes now so it has the danger like obviously like it's tells you what's going to happen in the film
00:34:14 glass recruits James Mary you just said it McAvoy James McAvoy as as his villain like the villains team up with Bruce
00:34:21 Willis got to stop him because he's a Superman character after all being suppressed by the fact that they're
00:34:26 apparently in some sort of Institute yes kind of interesting sorta is a potential of kind of getting conventional in terms
00:34:33 of plotting but well the nice thing is based on that trailer I'm not exactly sure what the plot is like you know that
00:34:40 that Sam Jackson and James McAvoy are gonna team up but he's have a bad-guy plan yeah pursue but but
00:34:48 I mean knowing sham lon like now these kind of having a little Renaissance and actually surprising people and making
00:34:54 decent movies again like who knows maybe I'll go in a different weird directions yeah yeah but maybe he'll bring in bring
00:35:02 in the elderly couple the end of the movie will be the elderly man showing up and just shoving diapers and everybody
00:35:14 that's his super villain power they call him the fecal later and unlike the Godzilla trailer I liked the color
00:35:24 palette of this movie there's lots of like purples and greens I should have tie-in with the different
00:35:29 characters each one kind of has this talk of color palettes why are you Bob Ross shut up I liked all the happy
00:35:35 little trees they're pretentious and nonsense I don't know if you realize it but the visuals are a big part of a
00:35:42 motion picture no it's all about this as that a Godzilla that has the little wheels that you when you roll them
00:35:57 around sparks come out of his mouth no they don't make those kind of toys anymore dude
00:36:02 although he does like his back comes off why I don't know this back part comes out it must be interchangeable with
00:36:12 other backs you better does he shoot water out of his mouth or something like maybe if you fill them up
00:36:19 with water and you squeeze him this is like me trying to figure out the Millennium Falcon hey I got this off
00:36:23 immediately though that's true let me see let me investigate this maybe you're supposed to hide drugs in him can
00:36:45 you my name is Kade I have an identical twin virtual reality I miss my brother along
00:37:30 with you who am i what am i it's a killer with unidentifiable DNA he has to be
00:38:08 alright this this feels like somebody doing a Neil green parody more than an actual meal Breen film I'll be right here
