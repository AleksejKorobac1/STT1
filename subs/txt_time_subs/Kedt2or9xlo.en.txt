00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Ariane Vinnie Alice he's a senior research scientist at google deepmind
00:00:07 and before that he was a Google brain and Berkeley his research has been cited over 39,000 times he's truly one of the
00:00:16 most brilliant and impactful minds in the field of deep learning he's behind some of the biggest papers
00:00:22 and ideas and AI including sequence the sequence learning audio generation image captioning neural machine translation
00:00:29 and of course reinforcement learning he's a lead researcher of the Alpha Star project creating an agent that defeated
00:00:36 a top professional at the game of StarCraft this conversation is part of the artificial intelligence podcast if
00:00:44 you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or simply connect with me on twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri D and now
00:00:54 here's my conversation with Arielle Minnie Alice you spearheaded the deepmind team behind
00:01:01 alpha star that recently beat a top professional player Starcraft so you have an incredible wealth of work and
00:01:09 deep learning in a bunch of fields but let's talk about Starcraft first let's go back to the very beginning even
00:01:16 before alpha star before deep mine before deep learning first what came first for you a lot for programming or a
00:01:26 love for videogames I think for me it definitely came first the drive to play videogames I really liked computers I
00:01:38 didn't really code much but what I would do is I would just mess with the computer break it and fix it that was
00:01:43 the level of skills I guess that I gained in my very early days I mean when I was 10 or 11 and then I really got
00:01:51 into video games especially Starcraft actually the first version I spent most of my time just playing kind of pseudo
00:01:58 professionally as professionally as you could play back in 98 in Europe which was not a very main scene like that
00:02:06 what's called nowadays eSports right of course in the 90s so how did you get into StarCraft what was your favorite
00:02:13 race how do you develop how did you develop your skill what was your strategy all that kind of thing so as a
00:02:20 player I tended to try to play not many games not to kind of disclose the strategies that I kind of developed and
00:02:27 I like to play random actually not in competitions but just to I think in StarCraft there's well there's three
00:02:34 main races and I found it very useful to play with all of them and so I would choose random many times even sometimes
00:02:41 in tournaments to gain skill on the three races because it's not how you play against someone but also if you
00:02:48 understand the race because you play it you also understand what's annoying what then when you're on the other side what
00:02:54 to do to annoy that person to try to gain advantages here and there and so on so I actually played random although I
00:03:01 must say in terms of favorite race I really liked zerk I was probably best at Zerg and that's probably what I tend to
00:03:09 use towards the end of my career year before starting University so let's step back a little bit could you try to
00:03:16 describe Starcraft to people that may never have played video games especially the massively online variety right so
00:03:24 craft so Starcraft is a real-time strategy game and the way to think about Starcraft perhaps if you understand a
00:03:32 bit chess is that there are there's a board which is called map or or or the gallic the map where people play against
00:03:40 each other there's obviously many ways you can play but the most interesting one is the one versus one setup where
00:03:47 you just play against someone else or even the built in AI right the wizard put a system that can play the game
00:03:53 reasonably well if you don't know how to play and then in this board you have again pieces like in chess but these
00:04:01 pieces are not there initially like they are in chess you actually need to decide to gather resources to decide which
00:04:08 pieces to build so in a way you're starting almost with no pieces you start gathering resources in StarCraft there's
00:04:15 minerals and gas that you you can gather and then you must decide how much do you want to focus for instance on gathering
00:04:22 more resources or starting to build units or pieces and then once you have enough pieces or maybe like attack you
00:04:32 know a good attack composition then you go and attack the other side of the map and now the other main difference with
00:04:38 chess is that you don't see the other side of the map so you're not seeing the moves of the enemy it's what we call
00:04:45 partially observable so as a result you must not only decide Trading of economy versus building your
00:04:53 own units but you also must decide whether you want to scout to gather information but also by
00:04:58 scouting you might be giving away some information that you might be hiding from the enemy so there's a lot of
00:05:05 complex decision-making all in real-time there's also unlike chess this is not a turn-based game you play basically all
00:05:15 the time continuously and thus some skill in terms of speed and accuracy of clicking is also very important and
00:05:21 people that train for these really play this game at an amazing skill I've seen many times these and if you
00:05:28 can witness this life is really really impressive so in a way it's kind of a chess where you don't see the other side
00:05:34 of the board you're building your own pieces and you also need to gather resources to basically get some money to
00:05:41 build other buildings pieces technology and so on from the perspective of the human player
00:05:47 the difference between that and chess or maybe that and a game like turn-based strategy like heroes a might of magic is
00:05:56 that there's an anxiety because you have to make these decisions really quickly and if you are not actually aware or
00:06:05 what decisions work it's a very stressful balance the if there's everything you describe is actually
00:06:09 quite stressful difficult to balance for a mature human player I don't know if it gets easier at the professional level
00:06:15 like if they're fully aware what they have to do but at the amateur level there's this anxiety oh crap I'm being
00:06:22 attacked oh crap I have to build up resource oh I have to probably expand and all these the time the real-time
00:06:29 strategy aspect is really stressful and computation I'm sure difficult we'll get into it but for me battlenet so
00:06:42 Starcraft was released in 98 20 years ago which is hard to believe and Blizzard battlenet with Diablo 96 came
00:06:51 out and to me it might be a narrow perspective but it changed online gaming and perhaps society forever
00:06:59 yeah but I may have made way too narrow viewpoint but from your perspective can you talk about the history of gaming
00:07:08 over the past 20 years is this how transformational how important is this line of games right so I think I I kind
00:07:17 of was an active gamer whilst this was developing the internet I'm online gaming so for me that the way it came
00:07:25 was I played other games strategy related I play a bit of common and conquer and then I played Warcraft 2
00:07:32 which is from Blizzard but at the time I didn't know I didn't understand about what Blizzard was or anything Warcraft 2
00:07:37 was just a game which is which was actually very similar to start off in many ways it's also
00:07:42 real-time strategy game and where there's orcs and humans so there's only two races throughs offline and it was
00:07:50 offline right so I remember a friend of mine came to to school say oh there's this new cool game called Starcraft and
00:07:55 I just said all these sounds like just a copy of Warcraft 2 until I kind of installed it and at the time I am from
00:08:03 Spain so we didn't have internet like very good internet right so there was for us a Starcraft became first kind of
00:08:10 an offline experience where you kind of start to play these missions right you play against some sort of scripted
00:08:17 things to develop the story of the characters in the game and then later on I start playing against the butene AI
00:08:24 and I thought it was impossible to defeat it then eventually you defeat one and you can actually break n7 built in
00:08:31 the eyes at the same time which also felt impossible but actually it's not that hard to beat seven built-in eyes at
00:08:39 once so once we achieve that also we discovered that we could play as I said internet wasn't that great but we could
00:08:46 play with the land right on like basically against each other if we were in the same place because you could just
00:08:52 connect machines with like cables right so we started playing in LAN mode and again you know as a group of friends and
00:08:59 it was really really like much more entertaining than playing against the eyes and later on as internet was
00:09:05 starting to develop and being a bit faster and more reliable then it's when I started experiencing battlenet which
00:09:11 is these amazing universe not only because of the fact that you can play the game against any way anyone in the
00:09:18 world but you can also get to know more people you just get exposed to now like this vast variety of it's kind of a bit when
00:09:26 the chats came about right there was a chat system you could play against people where you could also chat with
00:09:32 people not only about soccer but about anything and that became a way of life for kind of two years and obviously then
00:09:39 it became like an elite exploded didn't mean that I started to play more seriously going to tournaments and so on
00:09:44 so forth do you have a sense and a societal sociological level what
00:09:52 whole part of society that many of us are not aware of and it's a huge part of society which is gamers I mean every
00:10:01 time I come across that in YouTube or streaming sites I mean this is a huge number of people play games religiously
00:10:08 do you have a sense of those folks especially now that you've returned to that realm a little bit on the high side
00:10:15 yeah so in fact I even after soccer if I actually played World of Warcraft which is mainly the main sort of online world
00:10:23 or in presence that you get to interact with lots of people so I played that for a little bit it was to me it was a bit
00:10:29 less stressful than Starcraft because winning was kind of a given you just put in this world and you can always
00:10:36 complete missions but I think it was actually the social aspect of especially Starcraft first and then games like
00:10:45 World of Warcraft really shaped me in a very interesting ways because you had you get to experience it's just people
00:10:51 you wouldn't usually interact with right so even nowadays I still have many Facebook friends from the area where I
00:10:57 played online and their ways of thinking is even political they just don't we don't live in like we don't interact in
00:11:04 there in the real world but we were connected by basically fiber and that way I actually get to understand a bit
00:11:12 better that we live in a diverse world and these were just connections that were made by because you know I happened
00:11:19 to go in a city in a virtual city as a priest and I met these you know this warrior and we became friends and then
00:11:25 we start like playing together right so I think it's it's it's transformative and more and more and more people are
00:11:31 more aware of it I mean it's it's becoming quite mainstream but back in the day as you were saying in 2000 2005
00:11:40 even it was very still very strange thing to do especially in in Europe I think there were exceptions like Korea
00:11:48 for instance it was amazing like that that everything happened so early in terms of cyber cafes like it's if you go
00:11:56 to Seoul it's a city that back in the day Starcraft was kind of you could be a celebrity by playing Starcraft but this
00:12:03 was like 99 2000 right it's not like recently so yeah it's quite it's quite interesting to to look back and and yeah
00:12:11 I think it's changing society that the same way of course like technology and social networks and so on are also
00:12:17 transforming things and a quick tangent let me ask you're also one of the most productive people in your particular
00:12:26 chosen passion and path in life and yet you're also appreciate and enjoy video games do you think it's possible to do
00:12:35 to enjoy video games in moderation someone told me that you could choose two out of three when I was playing
00:12:42 video games you could choose having a girlfriend playing video games or studying and I think for the most part
00:12:51 it was relatively true these things do take time games like stark if you take the game pretty seriously and you wanna
00:12:57 study it then you obviously will dedicate more time to it and I definitely took gaming and obviously
00:13:05 studying very seriously I loved learning science and etc so to me especially when I started University undergrad I kind of
00:13:15 step off Starcraft I actually fully stopped playing and then wall of war curve was a bit more casual you could
00:13:21 just connect online and I mean it was it was fun but I as I said that was not as much time investment as it was for me in
00:13:31 StarCraft ok so let's get into alpha star what are the your behind the team so deep mine has been working on
00:13:38 Starcraft and released a bunch of cool open-source agents and so on the past few years but alpha star really is the
00:13:45 moment where the first time you beat a world-class player so what are the parameters of the challenge in the way
00:13:54 that alpha star took it on and how did you and David and the rest of deepmind team get into it
00:14:00 consider that you can even beat the best in the world or top players I think it all started in back in 2015
00:14:10 actually I'm lying I think it was 2014 when the mine was acquired by Google and I at the time was at Google brain which
00:14:17 is it it was in California in California we had this summit where we got together the two groups so Google
00:14:23 brain and google deepmind got together and we gave a series of talks and given that they were doing deep reinforcement
00:14:31 learning for games I decided to bring up part of my past which I had developed at Berkeley like this thing which we called
00:14:37 Berkeley over mine which is really just a Starcraft one but right so I about that and I remember them is just came to
00:14:46 me and said well maybe not now it's it's perhaps a bit too early but you should just come to the mine and do this again
00:14:53 with deep reinforcement learning right and at the time it sounded very science-fiction for for several reasons
00:15:00 but then in 2016 when I actually moved to London and joined in mind transferring from brain it became
00:15:07 apparent that because of the alphago moment and kind of Blizzard reaching out to us to say wait like do you want the
00:15:13 next challenge and also me being full-time at deep mine it's a sort of kind of all these came together and then
00:15:20 I was I went to to air vine in California to the Blizzard headquarters to just chat with them and try to
00:15:26 explain how would it all work before you do anything and the approach has always been about the learning perspective
00:15:36 right so in in Berkeley we did a lot of rule-based you know conditioning and or if you have more than three units then
00:15:43 go attack and if the other has more units than me I retreat and so on and so forth and of course the point of deep
00:15:48 reinforcement learning deep learning machine learning in general is that all these should be learned behavior so that
00:15:57 kind of was the DNA of the project since its inception in 2016 where we just didn't even have an environment to work
00:16:04 with and so these that's how it all started really so if you go back to a conversation with damage or even in your
00:16:12 own head how far away did you because that's we're talking about Atari games we're talking about go which is kind of
00:16:18 if you're honest about it really far away from Starcraft in a well now that you've beaten it maybe you could say
00:16:25 it's close but is it's much it seems like Starcraft is way harder than go philosophically in mathematically
00:16:33 speaking so how far away did you did you think you were do you think it's 2019 in 18 you could be doing as well as you
00:16:40 have yeah when I when I kind of thought about okay I'm gonna dedicate know a lot of my time and focus on this and
00:16:47 obviously I do a lot of different research in deep learning so spending time on it I mean I really had to kind
00:16:53 of think there's gonna be something good happening out of this so really I thought well this sounds impossible and
00:17:00 it probably is impossible to do the full thing like the all like the full game where you play one versus one and it's
00:17:09 only a neural network playing and so on so it really felt like I just didn't even think it was possible but on the
00:17:15 other hand I could see some stepping stones like towards that goal clearly you could define subproblems in
00:17:23 StarCraft and sort of dissect it a bit and say okay here is a part of the game here's another part and also obviously
00:17:30 the fact so this was really also critical to me the fact that we could access human replays right so Blizzard
00:17:36 was very kind and in fact they open-source these for the whole community where you can just go and it's
00:17:42 not every single Starcraft game ever played but it's a lot of them you can just go and download and every day they
00:17:48 will you can just query a dataset and say well give me all the games that were played today and given my kind of
00:17:56 experience with language and sequences and supervised learning I thought well that's definitely gonna be very helpful
00:18:03 and something quite unique now because ever before we had such a large dataset of replays of people playing the game at
00:18:12 this scale of such a complex video game right so that to me was a precious resource and as soon as I knew that
00:18:19 Blizzard was able to kind of give these to the community I started to feel positive about something non-trivial
00:18:26 happening but but I also thought the full thing like really no rules no no single line of code that tries to say
00:18:32 well I mean if you see this unit will the detector all these not having any of these specializations seemed really
00:18:39 really really difficult to me I do also like that Blizzard was teasing or even trolling you sort of almost yeah
00:18:49 pulling you in into this really difficult challenge they have any aware and that what's what's the interest from
00:18:56 the perspective of Blizzard except just curiosity yeah I think Blizzard has really understood and and really bring
00:19:03 bring forward these competitiveness of eSports in games the Starcraft really kind of sparked a lot of like something
00:19:11 that almost was never seen especially as I was saying he back in Korea so they just probably thought well this is such
00:19:19 a pure 1vs1 setup that it would be great to see if something that can play Atari or go and then later on chess could
00:19:29 could even tackle these kind of complex realtime strategy game right so for them they wanted to see first obviously
00:19:37 whether it was possible if the game they created was in a way solvable to some extent and I think on the other hand
00:19:44 they also are a pretty modern company that innovates a lot so just starting to understand AI for them to how to bring
00:19:52 AI into games is not is not AI for games but get a games for AI oh right I mean both ways I think can work and you up we
00:19:59 obviously did mine use games for AI right to drive AI progress but Blizzard might actually be able to do and many
00:20:06 other companies to start to understand done to the opposite so I think that is also something they can get out of these
00:20:12 and they definitely we have brainstorm a lot about about these right but one of the interesting things to me about
00:20:18 Starcraft and Diablo and these games that blizzards created is the task of balancing classes for example sort of
00:20:27 making the game fair from the starting point and then let's skill the term and the outcome is there  I mean can you
00:20:34 first comment there's three races Zerg Protoss and Terran I don't know if I've ever said that out loud is that how you
00:20:44 pronounce it Terran yeah yeah I don't think I've ever seen personally interact with anybody about Starcraft it's funny
00:20:51 so they seem to be pretty balanced I wonder if the AI the work that you're doing with the Alpha star would help
00:20:59 balance them even further is that something you think about is that something that Blizzard is thinking
00:21:05 about right so so balancing when you add a new unit or a new spell type is obviously possible given that you can
00:21:13 always train or retrain at scale some agent that might start using that in unintended ways but I think actually if
00:21:20 you understand how StarCraft has kind of co-evolved with players in a way I think it's actually very cool the ways that
00:21:27 many of the things and strategies that people came up with right so I think it's we've seen it over and over in
00:21:33 StarCraft that Blizzard comes up with maybe a new unit and then some players get creative and do something kind of
00:21:40 unintentional or something that Blizzard designers that just simply didn't test or think about and then after that
00:21:46 becomes kind of mainstream in the community Blizzard patches the game and and then they kind of maybe weaken that
00:21:53 strategy or or make it actually more interesting but a bit more balanced so these kind of continual talk between
00:21:59 players and Blizzard is is kind of what has defined them actually in actually most games that the in in stykera but
00:22:06 also in World of Warcraft they would do that there are several classes and it would be not good that everyone plays
00:22:12 absolutely the same race or and so on right so I think they they do care about balancing of course and they do a fair
00:22:20 amount of testing but it's also beautiful to to also see how players get creative anyways and I mean whether I
00:22:27 can be more creative at this point I don't think so right I mean it's just sometimes something so amazing happens
00:22:33 like I remember back in in the days like you have these drop ships that could drop rivers and that was actually not
00:22:40 thought about that you could drop this unit that has this what's called Splash Damage that would basically eliminate
00:22:48 all the enemies workers at once no one thought that you could actually put them and really early game do that kind of
00:22:55 damage and then we know things change in the game but I don't know I think there's it's quite an amazing
00:23:00 exploration process from both sides players and Blizzard alike well it's it's almost like a reinforcement
00:23:06 learning exploration but a the scale of humans that play that play Blizzard games is almost on the scale of a
00:23:15 large-scale deepmind RL experiment I mean if you look at the numbers that's I mean you're talking about I don't know
00:23:20 how many games but hundreds of thousands of games probably a month yeah I mean so that you could it's almost the same as
00:23:29 running RL agents what an aspect of the problem of StarCraft II things the hardest is it the like you said the
00:23:35 imperfect information is it the fact they have to do long term planning is it the real time aspects we have to do
00:23:43 stuff really quickly is it the fact that a large action space that you can do so many possible things or is it you know
00:23:51 in the game theoretic sense there is no Nash equilibria at least you don't know what the optimal strategy is because
00:23:56 there's way too many options right what's is there something that stands out is just like the hardest the most
00:24:03 annoying thing so when we sort of looked at the problem and start to define permit like the parameters of it right
00:24:09 what are the observations what are the actions it became very apparent that you know that the very first barrier that
00:24:17 one would hit in StarCraft would be because of the action space being so large and as not being able to search
00:24:25 like you could in in chess or or go even though the search space is vast the main problem that we identified was that of
00:24:34 exploration right so without any sort of human knowledge or human prior if you think about StarCraft and you know how
00:24:40 deep reinforcement learning is algorithm works work which is essentially by issuing random actions and hoping that
00:24:47 they will get some wins sometimes so they could learn so if you think of the of the action space in StarCraft almost
00:24:54 anything you can do in the early game is bad because any action involves taking workers which are mining minerals for
00:25:02 free that's something that the game does automatically sends them to mine and you would immediately just take them out of
00:25:10 mining and send them around so just thinking how how is it gonna be possible to to get to understand the
00:25:18 these concepts but but even more like expanding right there's there's these buildings you can place in other
00:25:23 locations in the map to gather more resources but the location of the building is important and you have to
00:25:30 select a worker send it walking to that location build the building wait for the building to be built and then put extra
00:25:37 workers there so they start mining that just that feels like impossible if you just randomly click to produce that
00:25:44 state desirable state that then you could hope to learn from because eventually that may yield to an extra
00:25:51 win right so for me the exploration problem and due to the actions pace and the fact that there's not really turns
00:25:57 there's so many turns because the game essentially peaks at 22 times per second if you mean that's how they keep
00:26:06 discretize sort of time obviously you always have to discretize time there's not no such thing as real time but it's
00:26:12 really a lot of time steps of things that could go wrong and that definitely felt a priori like the hardest you
00:26:19 mentioned many good ones I think partial observability and the fact that there is no perfect strategy because of the
00:26:26 partial observability those are very interesting problems we start seeing more and more now in terms of us we
00:26:31 solve the previous ones but the core problem to me was exploration and solving it has been basically kind of
00:26:38 the focus and how we saw the first breakthroughs so exploration you know in a multi hierarchical way so like 22
00:26:46 times the second exploration is a very different meaning than it does in terms of should I gather resources early or
00:26:53 should I wait or so on so how do you solve the long-term let's talk about the internals of alpha stuff so first of all
00:27:02 how do you represent the state of the game as an input right how do you then do the long term sequence modeling how
00:27:11 do you build a policy right also what's the architecture like so alpha star has obviously several components but
00:27:19 everything passes through what we call the policy which is a neural network and that's kind of the beauty of it there is
00:27:26 I could just now give you a neural network and some weights and if you fed the right observations
00:27:31 and you understood the actions the same way we do you would have basically the agent playing the game there's
00:27:37 absolutely nothing else needed other than those weights that were trained now the first step is observing the game and
00:27:45 we've experimented with a few alternatives the one that we currently use mixes both spatial sort of images
00:27:53 that you would process from the game that is the zoomed out version of the of the map and also assume the inversion of
00:28:00 the camera or the screen as we call it but also we give to the agent the list of units that it sees more of as a set
00:28:11 of objects that it can operate on that is not necessarily required to use it and we have versions of the game that
00:28:18 play well without this set vision that is a bit not like how humans perceive the game but it certainly helps a lot
00:28:25 because it's a very natural way to encode the game is by just looking at all the units that there are there they
00:28:32 have properties like health position type of unit whether it's my unit or the enemies and that's sort of is kind of
00:28:42 the the summary of the state of the of the game note that list of units or set of units that you see all the time well
00:28:48 that's pretty close to the way humans see it again why do you say it's not isn't it you're saying the exactness of
00:28:55 it is not yeah other humans the exactness of it is perhaps not the problem I guess maybe the problem if you
00:29:01 look at it from how actually humans play the game is that they play with a mouse on a keyboard and a screen and they
00:29:08 don't see sort of a structured object with all the units what they see is what they see on the screen right yes so
00:29:13 remember that there's a certain interrupt there's a plot that you showed with camera base where you do exactly
00:29:20 that right move around and that seems to converge it to similar performance yeah I think that's what I we're kind of
00:29:25 experimenting with what's necessary or not but using the set so actually if you look at research in computer vision
00:29:34 where it makes a lot of sense to treat images as two-dimensional arrays there is actually a very nice paper from
00:29:42 Facebook I think I forgot who the authors but I think it's part of gaming's has group and what they do is they take an
00:29:51 image which is this two-dimensional signal and they actually take pixel by pixel and scramble the image as if it
00:29:59 was just a list of pixels and crucially they encode the position of the pixels with at the XY coordinates and this is
00:30:06 just kind of a new architecture which we incidentally also use in StarCraft called the transformer which is a very
00:30:12 popular paper from last year which yielded very nice result in machine translation and if you actually believe
00:30:19 in this kind of or it's actually a set of pixels as long as you encode X Y it's okay then you you could argue that the list
00:30:26 of units that we see is precisely that because we have each unit as a kind of pixel if you will and then there XY
00:30:34 coordinates so in that perspective we without knowing it we use the same architecture that was shown to work very
00:30:41 well on Pascal on image net and so on so the interesting thing here is putting it in that way it starts to move it towards
00:30:48 the way you usually work with language so what and especially with your expertise and work in language it seems
00:30:59 like there's echoes of a lot of the way you would work with natural language in the way you've approached alpha star
00:31:05 right what's does that help with the long term sequence modeling there somehow exactly so so now that we
00:31:11 understand what an observation for a given time step is we need to move on to say well there's going to be a sequence
00:31:18 of such observations and an agent will need to given all that it's seen not only the current time step but all that
00:31:25 it's seen why because there is partial observability we must remember whether we saw a worker going somewhere for
00:31:30 instance right because then there might be an expansion and the top right of the map so given that what you must then
00:31:38 think about is there is the problem of given all the observations you have to predict the next action and not only
00:31:45 given all the observations but given all the observations and given all the actions you've taken predict the next
00:31:50 action and that sounds exactly like machine translation where and that's exactly how kind of I saw the problem
00:31:59 especially when you are given supervised data or replays from humans because the problem is exactly the same you're
00:32:06 translating essentially a prefix of observations and actions onto what's going to happen next which is exactly
00:32:12 how you would train a model to translate or to generate language as well right you have a certain prefix you must
00:32:18 remember everything that comes in the past because otherwise you might start having noncoherent text and the same
00:32:26 architectures we're using LST MS and transformers to operate on across time to kind of integrate all that's
00:32:33 happening in the past those architectures that work so well in translation or language modeling are
00:32:39 exactly the same than what the agent is using to issue actions in the game and the way we train in moreover for
00:32:46 imitation which is step one of alpha studies take all the human experience and try to imitate it much like you try
00:32:53 to imitate translators that translated many pairs of sentences from French to English say that sort of principle
00:33:00 applies exactly the same it's you mightyou it's almost the same code except that instead of words you have a
00:33:06 slightly more complicated objects which are the observations and the actions are also a bit more complicated that than
00:33:13 award is there a self play component into so once you run out of imitation right so so indeed you can bootstrap
00:33:23 from human replays but then the agents you get are actually not as good as the humans you imitated right so how do you
00:33:32 imitate well we take humans from 3,000 MMR and hire 3,000 MMR is just a metric of human skill and 3,000 MMR might be
00:33:42 like 50% percentile right so it's just Kevin average human what's that so maybe quick pause MMR's ranking scale the
00:33:50 matchmaking rating yeah for players so street  remember there's like a master and a grandmaster with 3000 so 3,000 is
00:33:57 is pretty bad I think it's kind of gold level it just sounds really good relative to chess I think oh yeah I know
00:34:03 the the rating is the best in the world are at 7,000 mm so 3,000 it's a bit like Eloy indeed
00:34:11 right so 3,300 just allows us to not filter a lot of the data so we like to have a lot of data in deep learning as
00:34:18 you probably know so we take these kind of 3,500 and above but then we do a very interesting trick which is we tell the
00:34:25 neural network what level they are imitating so we say these replay you're gonna try to imitate to predict the next
00:34:33 action for all the actions that you're gonna see is a 4,000 mm our replay this one is a 6,000 mm our replay and what
00:34:41 what's cool about this is then we take this policy that is being trained from human and then we can ask it to play
00:34:48 like a 3,000 mm our player by setting a bit saying well okay play like a 3,000 mm our player or play like a 6,000 mm
00:34:54 our player and you actually see how the policy behaves differently it gets worse economy if you play like a
00:35:02 gold level player it does less actions per minute which is the number of clicks or number of actions that you will issue
00:35:08 in a whole minute and it's very interesting to see that it kind of imitates the skill level quite well but
00:35:14 if we ask you to play like a 6000 mm our player we tested of course these policies to see how well they do they actually beat
00:35:21 all the built-in ai's that these are put in the game but they're nowhere near 6000 mm our players right they might be
00:35:27 maybe around gold level platinum perhaps so there's still a lot of work to be done for the policy to
00:35:35 truly understand what it means to win so far we only asked them ok here is the screen and that's what happened on the
00:35:42 game until this point what would the next action be that we asked you know we asked a pro - now say all this you're
00:35:49 gonna click here or here or there and the point is experiencing experiencing wins and losses is very important to
00:35:57 then start to refine otherwise the policy can get loose can can just go off policy as we call it that's so
00:36:02 interesting you can at least hope eventually to be able to control a policy approximately to be a some MMR
00:36:11 level that's that's so interesting especially given that you have ground truth for a lot of these cases right can
00:36:17 ask your personal questions or what's your mmm well I haven't played Starcraft 2 so I
00:36:24 am unranked oh is the kind of Lois League okay so I used to play Starcraft the first one and but you haven't
00:36:33 seriously played so the best player we have a deep mind is about five thousand MMR which is high masters is not at
00:36:41 Grandmaster level Grandmaster level would be the top 200 players in a certain region like Europe
00:36:50 or America or Asia but for me it would be hard to say I am very bad at the game I actually played alpha star a bit too
00:36:57 late and it bit me I remember the whole team was Oreo you should play yeah and I was it looks like it's not so good yet
00:37:04 and then I remember I kind of got busy and waited an extra week and I played and it really beat me
00:37:11 very badly was it I've heard that feel it's not an amazing feelings amazing yeah I mean obviously I tried my best
00:37:18 and I try to also impress my because I actually played the first game so I'm still pretty good at micromanagement
00:37:24 the promise I just don't understand Starcraft 2 I understand Starcraft and when I played Starcraft I probably was
00:37:32 consistently like for for a couple years top 32 in Europe so I was decent but at the time we didn't have this kind of MMR
00:37:40 system as as well established so it would be hard to know what what it was back then so what's the difference in
00:37:46 interface between alpha star and Starcraft and a human player and Starcraft is there any significant
00:37:52 differences between the way they both see the game I would say the way they see the game there's a few things that
00:38:01 are just very hard to simulate the main one perhaps which is obvious in hindsight is what's called cloaked units
00:38:11 which are invisible units so in StarCraft you can make some units that you need to have a particular kind of
00:38:19 unit to detect it so these units are invisible if you cannot detect them you cannot target them so they would just you know
00:38:26 destroy your buildings or kill your workers but despite the fact you cannot target the
00:38:33 unit there's a shimmer that as a human you observe I mean you need to train a little bit you need to pay attention but
00:38:40 you would see this kind of space-time as space-time like distortion and you wouldn't know okay there art yeah yeah
00:38:47 it's like a wave thing yeah she's kinda storsch I don't like it that's really like the Blizzard term is shimmer
00:38:54 shimmer and so this shimmer professional players actually can see it immediately they understand it very well but it's
00:39:01 still something that requires certain amount of attention and and and it's kind of a bit annoying to deal with
00:39:07 whereas four alpha star in terms of vision it's very hard for us to simulate sort of
00:39:13 you know are you looking at these pixel in the screen and so on so the only thing we can do is we there is a unit
00:39:20 that's invisible over there so alpha star would know that immediately obviously still obeys the rules you
00:39:26 cannot attack the unit you must have a detector and so on but it's it's kind of one of the main things that it just
00:39:32 doesn't feel there's there's a very proper way I mean you could imagine are you you don't have high present know
00:39:37 exactly where it is or sometimes you see it sometimes you don't but it's it's just really really complicated to get it
00:39:44 so that everyone would agree oh that's that's the best way to simulate this right you know it seems like a
00:39:50 perception problem it is a perception problem so so the only problem is people are you ask what's the difference
00:39:56 between how humans perceive the game I would say they wouldn't be able to tell a shimmer immediately as it appears on
00:40:01 the screen whereas alpha star in principal sees it very sharply right it seems okay it sees
00:40:08 that the beat turned from zero to one meaning there's now a unit there although you don't know the unit or you
00:40:13 don't know it you know you know that you cannot attack it and so on God so that from from a vision standpoint that
00:40:21 probably is the one that is kind of the most obvious one then there are things humans cannot do perfectly even
00:40:27 professionals which is they might miss a detail or they might have not seen a unit and obviously as a computer if
00:40:34 there's a corner of the screen that turns green because a unit enters the field of view that can go into the
00:40:41 memory of the agent the lsdm and Percy's there for a while for whatever for however long is
00:40:47 relevant right and in terms of action it seems like the rate of action from an alpha star is comparative if not slower
00:40:54 than professional players but is there but it's more precise as well right so so that's that's a very like that's
00:41:01 really probably the one that is causing us more issues for a couple of reasons right the first one is Starcraft has been an
00:41:10 AI environment for quite a few years in fact I mean I was participating in the very first competition back in 2010 and
00:41:19 there's really not been a kind of a very clear set of rules how the actions per minute the rate of actions that you can
00:41:27 issue is and as a result these agents or bots that people build in a kind of almost very cool way they do like 20,000
00:41:36 40,000 actions per minute now now to put this in perspective a very good professional human my du 300 to 800
00:41:44 actions per minute they might not be as precise that's why the range is a bit tricky to to identify exactly I mean 300
00:41:52 actions per minute precisely is probably realistic 800 is probably not but you see humans doing a lot of actions
00:41:58 because they warm up and they kind of select things and spam and so on just so that when they need they have the
00:42:07 accuracy so we came into this by not having kind of a standard way to say well how do we measure whether an agent
00:42:16 is at human level or not on the other hand we had a huge advantage which is because we do imitation learning agents
00:42:24 turned out to act like humans in terms of rate of actions even Precision's and imprecisions of actions in the supervise
00:42:31 policy you could see all this you could see how agents like to spam click to move here if you played specially Diablo
00:42:37 you would know what I mean I mean you just duck like spam or a move here Murphy a move here you're doing
00:42:43 literally like maybe five actions in two seconds but these actions are not very meaning meaningful one would have
00:42:50 sufficed so on the one hand we start from this imitation policy that is at the ballpark of the actions per millions
00:42:56 of humans because it acts statistically trying to imitate humans so we see these very nicely in the
00:43:02 curves that we showed in the blog post like this these actions per minute and the distribution looks very human-like
00:43:10 but then of course as self play kicks in and and that's the part we haven't talked too much yet but of course the
00:43:16 agent must played getting itself to improve then there's almost no guarantees that these actions will not
00:43:23 become more precise or even the rate of actions is going to increase over them so what we did and this is probably kind
00:43:30 of the first attempt that we thought was reasonable is we looked at the distribution of actions for humans for
00:43:37 certain windows of time and just to give a perspective because I guess I mentioned that some of these agents that
00:43:42 are programmatic let's call them they do 40,000 actions per minute professionals as I said to 300 to 800 so what we
00:43:49 looked is we look at a distribution over professional gamers and we took reasonably high actions per minute but
00:43:56 we kind of identify certain cat offs after which if even if the agent wanted to act these actions would be dropped
00:44:04 but the problem is this cutoff is probably set a bit too high and what ends up happening even though the games
00:44:11 and when we ask the professionals and the gamers by by and large they feel like it's playing human-like there are
00:44:19 some Asians that developed maybe slightly too high a PMS which is actions per minute combined with the precision
00:44:28 which made people sort of start discussing a very interesting issue which is should we have limited these
00:44:35 should we just let it loose and see what cool things it can come up with right so this is in itself an extremely
00:44:42 interesting question but the same way that modeling the shimmer would be so difficult modeling absolutely all the details
00:44:49 about muscles and precision and an tiredness of humans would be quite difficult right so we're here in kind of
00:44:57 innovating in this sense of okay what could be maybe the next iteration of putting more rules that makes the agents
00:45:06 more human-like in terms of restrictions yeah putting constraints that more constraints yeah that's really
00:45:11 interesting that's really innovative so one of the constraints you put on your on yourself or at least focused in is on
00:45:19 the protoss race as far as I understand can you tell me about the different races and how they so protoss terran and
00:45:27 the Zerg how do they compare how do they interact why did you choose Protoss in right there is in the dynamics of the
00:45:34 game you seen from a strategic perspective so Protoss so in stacked of there are three races indeed in the
00:45:43 demonstration we saw only the Protoss race so maybe let's start with that one Protoss is kind of the most
00:45:49 technologically advanced race it has units that are expensive but powerful right so in general you want to kind of
00:45:58 conserve your units as you go attack so you wanna and and then you want to utilize these tactical advantages of
00:46:07 very fancy spells and so on so forth and at the same time they're kind of people say like they're they're a bit easier to
00:46:16 play perhaps right but that I actually didn't know I mean I just talked to now a lot to the players that we we work
00:46:23 with TLO and mana and they said oh yeah Protoss is actually people think is actually one of the easiest races so
00:46:28 perhaps the easier that doesn't mean that it's you know obviously professional players excel at the three
00:46:36 races and there's never like a race that dominates for a very long time anyway so if you look at the top and 100 in the
00:46:43 world is there one race that dominates that list it would be hard to know because it depends on the regions I
00:46:49 think it's pretty equal in terms of distribution and Blizzard wants it to be equal right they don't want they
00:46:56 wouldn't want one race like Protoss to not be representative in the top place so definitely like they tried it to be
00:47:04 like the balance right so then maybe the opposite race of Protoss is zerk dirt is a race where you just kind of expand and
00:47:13 take over as many resources as you can and they have a very high capacity to regenerate their units so if you have an
00:47:20 army it's not that valuable in terms of losing the whole army is not a big deal azarkh because you can then rebuild it
00:47:28 and given that you generally accumulate a huge Bank of resources zurk steep it will play by a prayer applying a lot of
00:47:35 pressure may be losing their whole army but then rebuilding it quickly so although of course every race I mean
00:47:43 there is never I mean they're pretty diverse I mean there's some unity insert that are technologically advanced and
00:47:48 they do some very interesting spells and there's some units in proto's that are less valuable and you could lose a lot
00:47:54 of them and rebuild them and it wouldn't be a big deal all right so maybe I'm missing out maybe I'm gonna say some
00:48:02 dumb stuff but just summary of strategy so first there's collection of a lot of resources right so that's one option the
00:48:10 other one is expanding so building other basins then the other is obviously attack ability building units and
00:48:17 attacking with those units and then I don't know what else there is maybe there is the different timing of attacks
00:48:26 like to attack early attack ready what are the different strategies that emerged that you've learned about I've
00:48:30 read the a bunch of people are super happy that you guys have apparently that alpha star apparently is discovered
00:48:36 that's really good too what is it saturate oh yeah they're mind-numbing online yeah the mineralogist yeah yeah
00:48:44 the in it for greedy amateur players like myself that's always been a good strategy you just build up a lot of
00:48:51 money and it just feels good it's just accumulate and accumulate so thank you for discovering that yeah validating all
00:48:57 of us but is there other strategies that you discovered interesting yeah unique to to this game yeah so if you look at
00:49:06 the kind of not being a stack of two player but of course Starcraft and Starcraft 2 and realtime strategy games
00:49:12 in general are very similar I would classify perhaps the openings of the game they're very important and
00:49:20 generally I would say there's two kinds of openings one that's a standard opening that's generally how players find
00:49:30 sort of a balance between risk and economy and building some you needs early on so that they could defend but
00:49:37 they're not to expose basically but also expanding quite quickly so this is would be kind of a standard opening and within
00:49:44 a standard opening then you what you do choose general is what technology are you aiming towards so there's a bit of
00:49:51 rock-paper-scissors of you could go for spaceships or you could go for invisible units or you could go for I don't know
00:49:58 like massive units that attack against certain kinds of units but they're weak against others so standard openings
00:50:05 themselves have some choices like rock-paper-scissors style of course if you Scout and you're good at guessing
00:50:11 what the opponent is doing then you can plane as an advantage because if you know you're gonna play rock I mean I'm
00:50:16 gonna play paper obviously so you can imagine that normal standard games in StarCraft looks like a continuous rock
00:50:25 paper scissor game where you guess what the distribution of rock paper and scissor is from the enemy and reacting
00:50:34 accordingly to try to beat it or you know put the paper out before he kind of changes his mind from rock to scissors
00:50:39 and then you would be in a weak position so sorry to pause on that I didn't realize this element cuz I know it's
00:50:45 true but poker I know I looked at Lambrakis you're this is so you're also estimating trying to guess the distribution to
00:50:53 better and better estimate the distribution what the Epona's likely to be doing yeah I mean as a player you
00:50:59 definitely want to have a belief state over what's up on the other side of the map and when your belief state becomes
00:51:06 inaccurate when you start having that serious doubts whether he's gonna play something that you must know that's when
00:51:13 you scout you wanna then gather information right it's improving the accuracy of the belief or improving the
00:51:20 belief state part of the loss that you try to optimize or is it just in a side effect it's implicit but you could
00:51:26 explicitly model it and it would be quite good that's probably predicting what's on the other side of the map but
00:51:33 so far it's all implicit the lot there's no no additional reward for predicting the enemy so there's these standard
00:51:40 opening x' and then there's what people call which is very interesting and alpha star sometimes really likes this kind of
00:51:48 cheese these cheese's what they are is kind of an all-in strategy you're gonna do something sneaky you're gonna hide
00:51:56 enemies as hide your own buildings close to the enemy base or you're gonna go for hiding your technological buildings so
00:52:03 that you do invisible units and the enemy just cannot react to detect it and does lose the game and there's quite a
00:52:10 few of these cheeses and variants of them and there is where actually the belief state becomes even more important
00:52:18 because if I spelled your base and I see no buildings at all any human prayer knows something's up they might know
00:52:24 well you're hiding something close to my base should I build suddenly a lot of units to defend should I actually block
00:52:31 my ramp with workers so that you cannot come and destroy my base so there's all these is happening and defending against
00:52:39 Jesus is extremely important and in the alpha star League many agents actually develop some cheesy strategies and in
00:52:47 the games we saw against elo and mana two out of the ten agents were actually doing these kind of strategies which are
00:52:54 cheesy strategies and then there's a baron of cheesy strategy which is called all-in so an all-in strategy is not
00:53:01 perhaps as drastic as oh I'm gonna build cannons on your base and then bring all my workers and try to just disrupt your
00:53:08 base and game over or GG as we say in StarCraft umm there's these kind of very cool things that you can align precisely
00:53:15 at a certain time mark so for instance you can generate exactly ten unit composition that is perfectly five of
00:53:22 these type five of disorder type and align the upgrade so that at four minutes and a half let's say you have
00:53:29 these ten units and the upgrade just finished and at that point that army is really scary and unless the enemy really
00:53:36 knows what's going on if you push you might then have an advantage because maybe the enemy is
00:53:42 doing something more standard it expanded too much it developed too much economy and any trade-off badly against
00:53:50 having defenses and the enemy will lose but it's called all-in because if you don't win then you're gonna lose
00:53:57 so you see players that do these kind of strategies if they don't succeed game is not over I mean they still have a place
00:54:02 and they still gathering minerals but they will just gg out of the game because they know well game is over I
00:54:08 gambled and I failed so if we start entering the game theoretic aspects of the game it's
00:54:15 really rich and it's really that's why it also makes it quite entertaining to watch even if I don't play I still enjoy
00:54:22 watching the game but the agents are trying to do this mostly implicitly but one element that we improved in self
00:54:30 plays creating the alpha star League and the alpha star League is not pure self play it's trying to create different
00:54:38 personalities of agents so that some of them will become cheese cheese agents some of them might become very
00:54:45 economical very greedy like getting all the resources but then being maybe early on they're gonna be weak but later on
00:54:51 they're gonna be very strong and by creating this personality of agents which sometimes it just happens
00:54:56 naturally that you can see kind of an evolution of agents that given the previous generation they trained against
00:55:03 all of them and then they generate kind of the count the perfect counter to that distribution but these these agents you
00:55:09 must have them in the populations because if you don't have them you're not covered against these things right
00:55:14 it's kind of you wanna you wanna you know create all sorts of the opponents that you will find in the wild so you
00:55:22 can be exposed to these cheeses early aggression later aggression more expansions dropping units in your base
00:55:30 from the side all these things and pure self play is getting a bit stack at finding some subset of these but not all
00:55:38 of these so the alpha star League is a way to kind of do an example of agents that they're all playing and in a league
00:55:45 much like people play on battlenet right they play you play against someone who does a new cool strategy and you
00:55:51 immediately oh my god I want to try it I want to play again and these to me was another critical part of the of the of
00:55:59 the problem which was can we create a battlenet for agents yeah that's kind of what the Alpha star league is really
00:56:05 fascinating and where they stick to their different strategies yeah wow that's it's really really interesting so but
00:56:13 that said you were fortunate enough or just skilled enough to win 5-0 and so how hard is it to win I mean that's not
00:56:21 the goal I guess I don't know what the goal is the goal should be to a majority not five zero but how hard is it in
00:56:29 general to win all matchups I don't want 1v1 so that's a very interesting question because once you
00:56:38 see alpha star and superficially you think well locate one let's if you some of the games like ten
00:56:44 to one right it lost the game that it played with the camera interface you might think well that's that's done
00:56:50 right there's it's it's super human at the game and that's not really the claim we really can make actually the claim is
00:56:59 we beat a professional gamer for the first time Starcraft has really been a thing that it's been going on for a few
00:57:06 years but moment a moment like this hasn't not had not occurred before yet but our decisions impossible to beat
00:57:14 absolutely not right so that's a bit what's you know kind of that the difference is the agents play at
00:57:19 Grandmaster level there definitely understand the game enough to play extremely well but are they am beatable
00:57:29 do they play perfect no and actually in StarCraft because of these sneaky strategies it's always possible that you
00:57:36 might take a huge risk sometimes but you might get wins right out of out of this so I think that as a domain it still has
00:57:45 a lot of opportunities not only because of course we want to learn with less experience we would like to I mean if I
00:57:51 if I learn to play Protoss I can play turn and learn it much quicker than alpha star can right so there are
00:57:57 obvious interesting research challenges as well but even as as the raw like as the raw performance goes really the
00:58:06 claim here can be we are at pro level or at high Grandmaster level but obviously the players also did not know what to
00:58:15 expect right this kind of their prior distribution was a bit off because they played this kind of new like alien brain
00:58:22 as they like to say drive and that's what makes it exciting for them but also I think if you look at the
00:58:29 games closely you see there were weaknesses in some points maybe alpha star did not scout or if it had got
00:58:36 invisible units going against at certain points it wouldn't have known and it would have been bad so there's still
00:58:43 quite a lot of work to do but it's really a very exciting moment for us to be seeing Wow a single neural net on a
00:58:50 GPU is actually playing against these guys who are amazing I mean you have to see them play in life if they're really
00:58:56 really amazing players yeah I'm sure there's there's the most there must be a guy in Poland somewhere right now
00:59:03 training his butt off to make sure that this never happens again with alpha star so that's really exciting in terms of
00:59:11 alpha star having some holes to exploit yeah it's just great and then you build on top of each other and it feels like
00:59:18 Starcraft I'll like go even if you win it's still not there it's still not there's so many different dimensions in
00:59:24 which you can explore so that's really really interesting do you think there's a ceiling to alpha star you've said that
00:59:32 it hasn't reached you know it's this is a big wait what you know let me actually just pause for a second how did it feel
00:59:41 to come here to this point to beat a top professional player like that night I mean you know Olympic athletes have
00:59:47 their gold medal right this is your gold medal and sense sure you're cited a lot you published a lot of prestige papers
00:59:54 whatever but this is like a win how did it feel I mean it was for me was unbelievable because first the win
01:00:06 itself me was so exciting I mean d so looking back to those last days of 2018 really well that's when the games were
01:00:14 played I'm sure I look back at that moment I say oh my god I want to be it like in a project like that it's like I
01:00:21 already feel the nostalgia of like yeah that was huge in terms of the energy and the team effort that went into it and so
01:00:29 in that sense as soon as it happened I already knew it was kind of I was losing it a little bit so it is almost like sad
01:00:35 that it happened and all like but on the other hand it also verifies the approach but to me also
01:00:43 there's so many challenges and interesting aspects of intelligence that even though we can train a neural
01:00:51 network to play at the level of the best humans there's still so many challenges so for me it's also like well this is
01:00:57 really an amazing achievement but I already was also thinking about next steps I mean as I said these agents play
01:01:05 Protoss vs. Protoss but they should be able to play a different race much quicker right so that would be an
01:01:11 amazing achievement some people call this matter reinforcement learning meta learning and so on right so there's so
01:01:19 many possibilities after that moment but the moment itself it really felt great it's I we had this bet so I I'm kind of
01:01:29 a pessimist in general so I kind of send an email to the team and said okay let's again steal offers right like what's
01:01:35 gonna be the result and I really thought we would lose like five zero right III we had some calibration made against the
01:01:46 5000 MMR player TLO was much stronger than that player even if he played Protoss which is his off race but yeah I
01:01:53 was not imagining we would win so for me that was just kind of a test run or something and then it really kind of he
01:02:00 was really surprised and unbelievably we went to this to this bar to celebrate and and dave tells me well why don't we
01:02:09 invite someone who is a thousand mm are stronger in proto's like an actual Protoss player like like that it turned
01:02:17 up being man all right and you know we had some drinks and I said sure why not but then I thought well that's really
01:02:22 gonna be impossible to beat I mean even because it's so much I had a thousand MMR is really like 99% probability that
01:02:31 mana would beat TLO as Protoss vs. Protoss right so we did that and to me the second the second game was much more
01:02:39 important even though a lot of uncertainty kind of disappeared after we we cannot beat the yellow I mean it he
01:02:46 is a professional player so that was kind of over that's really a very nice achievement but mana really was at the top and you
01:02:53 could see he played much better but our agents got much better too so it's a and then after the first game I said if we
01:03:01 take a single game at least we can say we beat a game I mean even if we don't beat the series for me that was a huge
01:03:08 relief and I mean I remember hugging them is and I mean it was it was really like this moment for me will resonate
01:03:14 forever as a researcher and I mean as a person and is a really like great accomplishment and it was great also to
01:03:21 be there with the team in the room I don't know if you saw like so it was really like I mean from my perspective
01:03:27 the other interesting thing is just like watching Kasparov watching mana was also interesting because he didn't he is kind
01:03:37 of a loss of words I mean whenever you lose I've done a lot of sports you sometimes say excuses you look for
01:03:44 reasons right and he couldn't really come up with a reason yeah yeah I mean so with the off race for Protoss you
01:03:51 could say it was it felt awkward it wasn't but here it was yeah it was it was just beaten and it was beautiful to
01:03:58 look at a human being being superseded by an AI system I mean it's a it's a beautiful moment for researchers so yeah
01:04:06 for sure it was it was I mean probably the highlight of my career so far because of its uniqueness and coolness
01:04:13 and I don't know I mean it's obviously as you said you can look at paper citations and so on but these these
01:04:19 really is like a testament of the whole machine learning approach and using games to advance technology I mean it's
01:04:27 really it really was everything came together at that moment that that's really the summary also on the other
01:04:33 side it's a popularization of AI too because just like traveling to to the moon and so on I mean this is where a
01:04:41 very large community of people that don't really and no way I get to really interact with it which is very important
01:04:48 I mean it's really we must you know writing papers helps our peers researchers to understand what we're
01:04:55 doing but I think AI is becoming mature enough that we must sort of try to explain what it is and perhaps through
01:05:02 games is an obvious way because these games always had built so it may be everyone experience an AI
01:05:08 playing a video game even if they don't know because there's always some scripted element and some people might
01:05:14 even call that AI already right so what are other applications of the approaches underlying alpha star that you see
01:05:22 happening there's a lot of echoes of he said transformer of language modeling so on have you already started thinking
01:05:30 where the breakthroughs in alpha star get expanded to other applications right so I thought about a few things for like
01:05:38 kind of next months next year's the main thing I'm thinking about actually is what's next as a kind of a grand
01:05:45 challenge because for me like we've seen Atari and then there's like the sort of three-dimensional worlds that we've seen
01:05:52 also like pretty good performance from these capture-the-flag agents that also some people at deep
01:05:57 mine and elsewhere are working on we've also seen some amazing results on like for instance dota 2 which is also a very
01:06:05 complicated game so for me like the main thing I'm thinking about is what's next in terms of challenge so as a researcher
01:06:13 I see sort of two tensions between research and then applications or areas or domains where you apply them so on
01:06:21 the one hand we've done thanks to the application of StarCraft is very hard we develop some techniques some new
01:06:26 research that now we could look at elsewhere like are there other applications where we can apply this and
01:06:33 the obvious ones absolutely you can think of feeding back to sort of the community we took from which was mostly
01:06:40 sequence modeling or natural language processing so we've developed an extended things from the transformer and
01:06:48 and we use pointer networks we combine LSD and transformers in interesting ways so that perhaps the kind of lowest
01:06:56 hanging fruit of feeding back to now different fields of machine learning that's not playing video games let me go
01:07:03 old-school and jump to the to mr. Alan Turing yeah so the Turing test you know there's a natural language
01:07:12 test the conversational test what's your thought of it as a test for intelligence do you think it is a grand challenge
01:07:19 that's worthy of undertaking maybe if it is would you reformulate it or phrase it somehow differently right so I really
01:07:26 love the Turing test because I also like sequences and language understanding and in fact some of the early work we did in
01:07:34 machine translation we tried to apply to apply to kind of a neural chat bot which obviously would never pass the Turing
01:07:42 test because it was very limited but it is a very fascinating fascinating idea that you could really have an AI that
01:07:51 would be indistinguishable from humans in terms of asking or conversing with with it right so I think the test itself
01:08:01 seems very nice and it's kind of well defined actually like the passing it or not I think there's quite a few rules
01:08:09 that feel like pretty simple and and and you know you could you could really like have I mean I think they have these
01:08:15 competitions every year yes of the laudner prize but I don't know if you've seen a I don't know if you've seen the
01:08:23 kind of bots that emerge from that competition they're not quite as what you would so it feels like that there's
01:08:30 weaknesses with the way tauren formulated it it needs to be that the definition of a genuine rich fulfilling
01:08:40 human conversation it needs to be something else like the Alexa prize which I'm not as well familiar with has
01:08:46 tried to define that more I think by saying you have to continue keeping a conversation for 30 minutes something
01:08:51 like that so basically forcing the agent not to just fool but to have an engaging
01:08:59 conversation kind of thing is that I mean is is this have you thought about this problem richly like as and if if
01:09:09 you have in general how how far away are we from you worked a lot on language understanding language generation but
01:09:18 the full dialogue the conversation you know just sitting at the bar having a couple of beers for an hour and that
01:09:23 kind of conversation have you thought about yeah so I think you touched here on the critical point which is
01:09:29 feasibility right so so there's there's a great sort of essay by Hamming which describes sort of grand challenges of
01:09:40 physics and he argues that well okay for instance teleportation or time travel our great grand challenges of physics
01:09:47 but there's no attacks we really don't know or cannot kind of make any progress so that's why most physicists and so on
01:09:55 they don't work on these in their PhDs and and as part of their careers so I see the Turing test as I in the full
01:10:02 Turing test as a bit still too early like I am I think we're especially with the current trend of deep learning
01:10:10 language models we've seen some amazing examples I think GPD to being the most recent one which is very impressive but
01:10:19 to understand to fully solve passing or fooling a human to think that you're that there's a human on the other side I
01:10:25 think we're quite far so as a result I don't see myself and I probably would not recommend people doing a PhD on
01:10:32 solving the Turing test because it just feels it's kind of too early or too hard of a problem yeah but that said you said
01:10:38 the exact same thing about Starcraft about a few years ago so into damage so I prefer yeah you'll probably also be
01:10:47 the person who passes the Turing test in three years I mean I think I think that yeah so so we have the Sun record this
01:10:55 is nice it's really I mean that the it's true that progress sometimes is a bit unpredictable I really wouldn't have not
01:11:01 even six months ago I would not have predicted the level that we see that these agents can deliver at Grandmaster
01:11:09 level but I I have worked on language enough and basically my concern is not that something could happen a
01:11:15 breakthrough could happen that would bring us to solving or passing the Turing test is that I just think the
01:11:22 statistical approach to it like this it is not is not gonna cut it so we need we need the breakthrough we
01:11:28 is great for the community but given that I think there's quite a more uncertainty whereas for StarCraft I knew
01:11:37 what the steps would be to kind of get us there I think it was clear that using the imitation learning part and then
01:11:44 using these battlenet for agents were gonna be key and and it turned out that this was the case and a little more was
01:11:52 needed but not much more for Turing test I just don't know what the plan or execution plan would look like so that's
01:11:59 why I'm I myself working on it as a grand challenge is hard but there are quite a few sub challenges that are
01:12:05 related that you could say well I mean what if you create a great assistant like Google already has like the Google
01:12:13 assistant so can we make it better and can we make it fully new role and so on that I start to believe maybe we're
01:12:19 reaching a point where we should attempt these challenges like this conversation so much because the echo is very much to
01:12:25 start a conversation it's exactly how you approach StarCraft let's break it down into small pieces solve those and
01:12:31 you end up solving the whole game great but that said you you're behind some of the sort of biggest pieces of work and
01:12:39 deep learning in the last several years so you mentioned some limits what do you think of the current limits of deep
01:12:46 learning and how do we overcome those limits so if I had to actually use a single word to define the main challenge
01:12:53 in deep learning is a challenge that probably has been the challenge for many years and is that of generalization so
01:13:04 what that means is that all that we're doing is fitting functions to data and when the data we see is not from the
01:13:13 same distribution or even if there some times that it is very close to distribution but because of the way we
01:13:20 train it with limited samples we then get to this stage where we just don't see generalization as much as we can
01:13:29 generalize and I think adversarial examples are a clear example of these but if you study machine learning and
01:13:36 literature and you know the reason why as VMs came very popular where because they were dealing and they
01:13:42 had some guarantees about generalization which is unseen data or out of distribution or even within distribution
01:13:48 where you take an image adding a bit of noise these models fail so I think really I don't see a lot of progress on
01:13:59 generalization in in the strong generalization sense of the word I I think our neuron neural networks you can
01:14:08 always find design examples that will make their outputs arbitrary which is which which is not good because we
01:14:16 humans would never be fooled by these kind of images or manipulation of the image and if you look at the mathematics
01:14:23 you kind of understand this is a bunch of matrices multiplied together there's probably numerix and instability
01:14:31 that you can just find corner cases so I think that's really the underlying topic many times we see when even even at the
01:14:39 grand stage of like doing test generalization I mean if used if you start I mean passing the Turing test should
01:14:46 you should it be in English or should it be in any language right I mean as a human if you could you could if you ask
01:14:53 something in a different language you actually will go and do some research and try to translate it and so on
01:14:59 shoot the Turing test in clementa include that right and it's really a difficult problem and very fascinating
01:15:05 and very mysterious actually yeah absolutely but do you think it's if you were to try to solve it can you not grow
01:15:14 the size of data intelligently in such a way that the distribution of your training set does include the entirety
01:15:21 of the testing set I think is that one path the other path is totally new methodology right it's not statistical
01:15:27 so a path that has worked well and it worked well in in stark Ravin in machine translation and in languages scaling up
01:15:33 the data and the model and that's kind of been maybe the only single formula that the leap still delivers today in
01:15:41 deep learning right it's it's that scale data scale and model scale really do more and more of the things that we
01:15:48 thought oh there's no way it can generalize to these Ori there's no way it can generalize to that but I don't
01:15:53 think fundamentally it resolve with these and for instance I'm really liking some style or approach
01:16:02 that would not only have neural networks but it would have programs or some discrete decision-making because there
01:16:09 is what I feel there's a bit more like like I mean the example of the best example I think for understanding
01:16:16 disease I also worked a bit on or like we can learn an algorithm with a neural network right so you give it many
01:16:21 examples and it's going to sort your sort the input numbers or something like that but really strong generalization is
01:16:30 you give me some numbers or you ask me to create an algorithm that sorts numbers and instead of creating a neural
01:16:35 net which will be fragile because it's gonna go out of range at some point you're gonna give you numbers that are
01:16:41 too large to small and whatnot you just if you just create a piece of code that sorts the numbers then you can
01:16:48 prove that that will generalize to absolutely all the possible inputs you could give so I think that's the problem
01:16:55 comes with some exciting prospects I mean scale is a bit more boring but it really works and then maybe programs and
01:17:04 these critics tractions are a bit less developed but clearly I think they're quite exciting in terms of future for
01:17:12 the field do you draw any insight wisdom from the 80s and expert systems and symbolic systems about computing do you
01:17:19 ever go back to those reasoning that kind of logic do you think that might make a comeback you have to dust off
01:17:26 those books yeah I actually love actually adding more inductive biases to me the problem really is what are you
01:17:35 trying to solve if what you're trying to solve is so important that try to solve it no matter what then absolutely use
01:17:45 rules use domain knowledge and then use a bit of the magic of machine learning to empower to make the system as the
01:17:52 best system that will detect cancer or you know or detect weather patterns right or in terms of start of it also
01:18:00 was a very big challenge so I was definitely happy that if we had to get take cut a corner here and there it
01:18:05 could have been interesting to do and in fact in StarCraft we we start thinking about
01:18:11 expert systems because it's very you know you can define I mean people actually build stack reports by thinking
01:18:17 about those principal I guess you know state machines and rule-based and then you could you could think of combining a
01:18:25 bit of a rule-based system but that has also neural networks incorporated to make it generalize a bit better so
01:18:30 absolutely I mean we should we should definitely go back to those ideas and anything that makes the problem simpler
01:18:37 as long as your problem is important that's okay and that's research driving a very important problem and on the
01:18:44 other hand if you wanna really focus on the limits of reinforcement learning then of course you must try not to look
01:18:52 at imitation data or to look some like for some rules of the domain that would help a lot or even feature engineering
01:18:59 right so these these attention that depending on what you do I think both both ways are definitely fine and I
01:19:06 would never not do one or the other if you're as long as you what you're doing is important and needs to be soft right
01:19:12 right so there's a bunch of different ideas that that that you develop that I really enjoy so but one one is
01:19:22 translating from the image captioning translated finish the text just just another just beautiful yeah beautiful
01:19:31 idea I think that resonates throughout your work actually so the underlying nature of reality being language always
01:19:40 yes somehow so what's the connection between images and text rather the visual world and the world of language
01:19:50 in your view right so I think a piece of research that's been central to I would say even extending into Starcraft is is
01:19:56 this idea of sequence to sequence learning which what we really meant by that is that you can you can now really
01:20:04 input anything to a neural network as the input X and then the neural network will learn a function f that will take X
01:20:12 as an input and produce any output Y and these x and y's don't need to be like static or like a features like as
01:20:22 like a fixed vectors or anything like that it could be it really sequences and now beyond like data structures right so
01:20:30 that paradigm was tested in a very interesting way when we moved from translating French to English to
01:20:38 translating an image to its caption but the beauty the beauty of it is that really and that's actually how it
01:20:44 happened I run I change the line of code in this thing that was doing machine translation I and I came the next day
01:20:51 and I saw how it like it was producing captions that seemed like oh my god this is really really working and the
01:20:58 principle is the same right so I think I don't see text vision speech waveforms as something different here as long as
01:21:11 you basically learn a function that will vector eyes you know these into and then after we vectorize it we can then use
01:21:19 you know transformers LS DMS whatever the flavor of the month of the model is and then as long as we have enough
01:21:28 supervised data really this formula will work and we'll keep working I believe to some extent model of these
01:21:33 generalization issues that I mentioned before so but the testers to vectorize sort of former representation that's
01:21:40 meaningful nothing and your intuition now having worked with all this media is that once you are able to form that
01:21:47 representation you can basically take any things any sequence is there go back to Starcraft is there limits on the
01:21:57 length so we didn't really touch on a long term effect how did you overcome the whole really long term aspect of
01:22:05 things here is there some tricks or so the main streak so Starcraft if you look at absolutely every frame you might
01:22:12 think it's it's quite a long game so we would have to multiply 22 times 60 seconds per minute times maybe at least
01:22:22 10 minutes per game on average so there are quite a few frames but the trick really was to only observe in fact which
01:22:32 might be seen as a limitation but it is also computational advantage only observe when you act and then what the
01:22:40 neural network decides is what is the gap gonna be until the next action and if you look at most Starcraft games that
01:22:49 we have in the in the data set that Blaser provided it turns out that most games are actually only I mean it is
01:22:58 still a long sequence but it may be like a thousand to 1,500 actions which if you start looking at L STM's large LST M's
01:23:10 transformers it's it's not like it's not that that difficult especially if you have supervised learning if you had to
01:23:16 do it with reinforcement learning the credit assignment problem what is it that in this game that made you win that
01:23:22 would be really difficult but thankfully because of imitation learning we didn't kind of have to deal with these directly
01:23:29 although if we had to we tried it and what happen is you just take all your workers and attack with them and that
01:23:35 sort of is kind of obvious in retrospect because you start trying random actions one of the actions will be a worker that
01:23:42 goes to the enemy base and because it's self play it's not gonna know how to defend because it basically doesn't know
01:23:47 almost anything and eventually what you develop is this take our workers and attack because the the create assignment
01:23:56 issue in Arad is really really hard I do believe we could do better and that's maybe a research challenge for the
01:24:03 future but yeah even even in StarCraft the sequences are maybe a thousand which I believe there is within the realm of
01:24:10 what transformers can do yeah I guess the difference between Starcraft and go is in go and chest stuff starts
01:24:18 happening right away right so there's not yeah it's pretty easy to self play not easy but to sulfa is possible to
01:24:25 develop reasonable strategy as quickly as opposed to Starcraft meaning go there's only 400 actions but one action
01:24:34 is what people would call the god action that would be if you had expanded the whole search tree that's the best action
01:24:41 if you did minimax or whatever algorithm you would do if you had the computational capacity
01:24:48 but in StarCraft the 400 is miniscule like a in 400 you don't even like you you couldn't even click on the pixels
01:24:55 around a unit right so I think the problem there is in terms of action space size is way harder so and that
01:25:04 surge is impossible so there's quite a few challenges indeed that make this kind of a step step up in terms of
01:25:11 machine learning for humans maybe they playing Starcraft it seems more intuitive because it's looks real I
01:25:17 mean you know like the graphics and everything moves smoothly whereas I I don't know how to come in go
01:25:22 is a game that I wouldn't really mean to study it feels quite complicated but for machines kind of maybe easier reverse yes
01:25:28 which shows you the gap actually between deep learning and however the heck our brains work so you developed a lot of
01:25:36 really interesting ideas it's interesting to just ask what's the what's your process of developing new ideas
01:25:43 do you like brainstorming with others do you like thinking alone do you like like was it eating good fellow said he came
01:25:52 up with Gans after a few beers right he thinks beers are essential yeah coming up with new ideas we had beers to decide
01:25:59 to play another game game of Starcraft after a week so it's really similar to that story actually I explained this in
01:26:06 a in a deep mind retreat and I said this is the same as the gun story I mean we were wearing a bar and we decided let's
01:26:11 play again next week and that's what happened I feel like we're giving the wrong message to young undergrads yeah
01:26:17 but in general like yeah do you like brainstorming do you like thinking alone working stuff out and so I think I think
01:26:23 throughout the years also things changed right so initially I was very fortunate to be with great minds like Geoff Hinton
01:26:35 Jeff Dean Ilya sutskever I was really fortunate to join brain at a very good time so at that point it ideas I was
01:26:41 just kind of brainstorming with my colleagues and learned a lot and keep learning is actually something you
01:26:48 should never stop doing right so learning implies reading papers and also these casting ideas with others it's
01:26:55 very hard at some point to not communicate that being reading paper forms from someone or actually
01:27:03 discussing right so definitely that communication aspect needs to be there whether it's written or oral nowadays
01:27:12 I'm also trying to be a bit more strategic about what research to do so I was describing a little bit this sort of
01:27:20 tension between research for the sake of research and then you have on the other hand applications that can drive the
01:27:27 research right and honestly the formula that has worked best for me is just find a hard problem and then try to see how
01:27:35 research fits into it how it doesn't fit into it and then you must innovate so I think machine translation drove sequence
01:27:44 to sequence then maybe like learning algorithms that had to like combinatorial algorithms led to pointer
01:27:52 networks Starcraft led to really scaling a permutation learning and the Alpha star league so that's been a formula
01:27:59 that I personally like but the other one is also about it and I seen it succeed a lot of the times where you just want to
01:28:07 investigate model-based RL as a kind of a research topic and then you must then start to think well how are the tests
01:28:13 how are you going to test these ideas you need to kind of a minimal environment to try things you need to
01:28:19 read a lot of papers and so on and that's also very fun to do and something I've also done quite a few times both at
01:28:26 brain at the mine and obviously as as a PhD so so I think besides that the ideas and discussions I think it's important
01:28:37 also because you start sort of guiding not only your own goals but other people's goes to the next breakthrough
01:28:45 so you you must really kind of understand these you know feasibility also as we were discussing before right
01:28:52 whether whether these domain is ready to be tackled or not and you don't want to be too early you obviously don't want to
01:28:57 be too late so it's it's really interesting and this is a strategic component of research which I think as a
01:29:05 grad student I just had no idea to you know I just read papers and discussed ideas and I think this has been maybe
01:29:11 the major change and I recommend people kind of feed forward to success how it looks like and try to backtrack
01:29:17 other than just kind of looking out these looks cool these looks cool and then you do a bit of random work which
01:29:22 sometimes you stumble upon some interesting things but in general it's it's also good to plan a bit yeah I like it
01:29:30 especially like your approach I've taken a really hard problem stepping right in and then being super skeptical about
01:29:38 yeah being robbed I mean there's a balance of both right there's a silly optimism and and a critical sort of
01:29:48 skepticism that's good to balance which is why it's good to have a team of people that that balance that you don't
01:29:54 do that on your own you have both mentors that have seen or you obviously wanna chat and discuss whether it's the
01:30:03 right time I mean Demi's came in 2014 and he said maybe in a bit we'll do starcraft and maybe he knew and that's
01:30:10 and I'm just following his lead which is great because he's he's brilliant right so these these things are obviously
01:30:19 quite important that you wanna be surrounded by people who you know are diverse they they have their knowledge
01:30:26 there's also important too I mean I I've learned a lot from people who actually have an idea that I might not think it's
01:30:34 good but if I give them the space to try it I've been proven wrong many many times as well so that's that's great
01:30:41 it's I think it's your colleagues are more important than yourself I think so sure now let's real quick talk about
01:30:49 another impossible problem AGI right what do you think it takes to build a system that's human level intelligence
01:30:55 we talked a little bit about the Tauranga stark after all these have echoes of general intelligence but if
01:31:01 you think about just something that you would sit back and say wow this is really something that resembles human
01:31:08 level intelligence what do you think it takes to build that so I find that AGI oftentimes is maybe not by well defined
01:31:19 so what I'm trying to then come up with for myself is what would be a result look like that you would
01:31:26 start to believe that you would have agents or neural nets that no longer sort of over feet to a single task right
01:31:36 but actually kind of learn the skill of learning so to speak and that actually is a field that I am fascinated by which
01:31:44 is the learning to learn or meta learning which is about no longer learning about a single domain so you
01:31:50 can think about the learning algorithm itself is general right so the same formula we applied for alpha star or
01:31:58 Starcraft we can now apply to kind of almost any video game or you could apply to many other problems and domains but
01:32:05 the algorithm is what's kind of generalizing but the neural network the weights those weights are useless even
01:32:12 to play another race right I train a network to play very well at Protoss vs. Protoss I need to throw away those
01:32:19 weights if I want to play now terran vs terran i would need to retrain a network from scratch with the same
01:32:26 algorithm that's beautiful but the network itself will not be useful so I think when I if I see an
01:32:34 approach that can observe or start solving new problems without the need to kind of restart the process I think that
01:32:43 to me would be a nice way to define some form of AGI again I don't know the grand views like age I mean so it should
01:32:50 Turing test nice or before AGI I mean I don't know I think I think concretely I would like to see clearly that meta
01:32:58 learning happened meaning there there is an architecture or network that as it sees new new problem or new data it
01:33:07 solves it and to make it kind of a benchmark it should solve it at the same speed that we do solve new problems when
01:33:13 I define your new object and you have to recognize it when I when you start playing a new game you played all the
01:33:18 times but now you play a new Atari game well you you're gonna be pretty quickly pretty good at the game so that's
01:33:26 perhaps what's the domain and what's the exact benchmark is a bit difficult I think as a community we might need to do
01:33:32 some work to define it but I think this first step I could see it happen relatively soon but then the
01:33:41 whole what a GI means and so on I am a bit more confused about what I think people mean different things there's an
01:33:50 emotional psychological level that like the even the Turing test passing the Turing test is something that we just
01:33:56 passed judgment on human beings what it means to be you know as a as a dog in a GI system yeah like what level what does
01:34:07 it mean right yeah what does it mean but I like the generalization and maybe as a community would converge towards a group
01:34:13 of domains that are sufficiently far away that would be really damn impressive if we're able to generalize
01:34:20 some perhaps not as close as Protoss and Zerg but like Wikipedia step be a good stuff and then a really good step but
01:34:28 then then like Wickham Starcraft 2 Wikipedia yeah I'm back yeah that kind of thing and that that feels also quite
01:34:36 hard and far but I think there's as long as you put the benchmark out as we discovered for instance with image net
01:34:43 then tremendous progress can be had so I think maybe there's a lack of benchmark but I'm sure we'll find one and yeah a
01:34:50 community will will then work towards that and then beyond what a GI might mean or would imply I really am hopeful
01:35:01 to see basically machine learning or AI just scaling up and helping you know people that might not have the resources
01:35:10 to hire an assistant or that they might not even know what the weather is like but you know so I think there's in terms
01:35:17 of the impact the positive impact of AI I think that's maybe what we should also not lose focus right the research
01:35:24 community building AG I mean that's a real nice girl but man I think the way that deep mind puts it is and then use
01:35:31 it to solve everything else right so I think we should paralyze yeah we shouldn't forget about all the positive
01:35:37 things that are actually coming out of it already and I are not going to be coming out right but
01:35:45 that I know let me ask relative the popular perception do you have any worry about the existential threat of
01:35:51 artificial intelligence in the near or far future that some people have I think I'm in the near future I'm I'm skeptical
01:36:01 so I hope I'm not wrong but I'm I'm not concerned but I I appreciate efforts ongoing efforts and even like whole
01:36:09 research fields on AI safety emerging and in conferences and so on I think that's great in the long term I really
01:36:18 hope we just can simply have the benefits outweigh the potential dangers I am hopeful for that but also we must
01:36:26 remain vigilant to kind of monitor and assess whether the trade-offs are are there and and we have you know enough
01:36:34 also lead time to prevent or to redirect our efforts if need be right so but I'm quite I'm quite optimistic about the
01:36:43 technology and definitely more fearful of other threats in terms of planetary level at this point but obviously that's
01:36:52 the one I kind of have more like power on so clearly I do start thinking more and more about this and it's kind of
01:37:00 it's groaning me actually to to start reading more about AI safety jeez afield that so far I have not really
01:37:06 contributed to but maybe there's something to be done there as well I think it's really important you know I
01:37:11 would talk about this issue folks but it's important to ask you and shove it in your head because you're at the
01:37:18 leading edge of actually what people are excited about nay I I mean the work with alpha star it it's arguably at the very
01:37:25 cutting edge of the kind of thing that people are afraid of and so you speaking to that fact and that we're actually
01:37:33 quite far away to the kind of thing that people might be afraid of but it's still something worthwhile to think about and
01:37:41 it's also good that you're the you're not as worried and you're also open to us yeah me Maura
01:37:47 there's two aspects I mean me not being worried but obviously we should prepare for for for it right for for like
01:37:54 forever for things that could go wrong misuse of the technologies as with any technologies right so I think there's
01:38:03 there's always trade-offs and I I as a society we've kind of solved these to some extent within the past so I'm
01:38:10 hoping that by having the researchers and the whole community brainstorm and come up with interesting solutions to
01:38:17 the new things that will happen in the future that we can still also push the research to the Avenue that I think is kind of
01:38:25 the greatest Avenue which is to understand intelligence right how are we doing what we're doing and you know
01:38:32 obviously from a scientific standpoint that is kind of the drive my personal driver of all the time that I spend
01:38:40 doing what I'm doing really what do you see the deep learning as a field heading what do you think the next big big
01:38:47 breakthrough might be so I think deep learning I I discuss a little of this before deep learning has to be combined
01:38:55 with some form of discretization program synthesis I think that's kind of as a research in itself is an interesting
01:39:02 topic to expand and start doing more research and then as kind of what will deep learning and able to do in the
01:39:09 future I don't think that's gonna be what's gonna happen this year but also this idea of starting not to throw away
01:39:17 all the weights that the this idea of learning to learn and really having these agents not having to restart their
01:39:26 weights and you you can have an agent that is kind of solving or classifying images on image net but also generating
01:39:34 speech if you ask it to generate some speech and and it should really be kind of almost the same network but might not
01:39:42 be a neural networking might be a neural network with a optimization algorithm attached to it but I think this idea of
01:39:49 generalization to new tasks is something that we first must define good benchmarks but then I think that's gonna
01:39:55 be exciting and I'm not sure how close we are but I think there's the pet if you have a very
01:40:01 limited domain I think we can start doing some progress and much like how we did a lot of programs in computer vision
01:40:09 we should start thinking am I really like a talk that gave that Leon blue to give gave at ICML a few years ago which
01:40:16 is this train test paradigm should be broken we we know we should stop thinking about a training test at
01:40:23 Acharya training set and a test set and these are closed you know things that are untouchable I think we should go
01:40:29 beyond these and in meta learning we call these the meta training set and the meta test set which is really thinking
01:40:37 about if I know about imagenet why would that network not work on M NIST which is a much simpler problem but right now it
01:40:44 really doesn't it you know yeah and but it just feels wrong right so I think that's kind of the there's the on the
01:40:52 application or the benchmark sites we we probably will see quite a few more interest and progress and hopefully
01:40:59 people defining new and exciting challenges really do you have any hope or interest in knowledge graphs within
01:41:06 this context so just kind of totally yeah constructing graph so going back that graphs yap well okay neural
01:41:12 networks and graphs but I mean a different kind of knowledge graph sort of like semantic graphs or there's
01:41:21 concepts yeah so I think I think the the idea of graphs is is so I've been quite interested in sequences first and then
01:41:28 more interesting or different data structures like graphs and I've studied graph narrow networks in the last three
01:41:36 years or so I found these models just very interesting from like deep learning sites standpoint but then how what do we
01:41:46 want why do we want these models and and why would we use them what's the application what's kind of the killer
01:41:53 application of graphs right and perhaps if we could extract a knowledge Graff from Wikipedia automatically right
01:42:02 that would be interesting because then these graphs have this very interesting structure that also is a bit
01:42:09 more comfortable with this idea of programs and deep learning kind of working together
01:42:14 the jumping neighborhoods and so on you could imagine defining some primitives to go around graphs right so I think I
01:42:22 really like the idea of a knowledge graph and in fact when we we started or you know as part of the research we did
01:42:31 for StarCraft I thought wouldn't it be cool to give the graph of you know all the prerequisites like this all these
01:42:39 buildings that depend on each other and units that have prerequisites of being built by that and so this is information
01:42:46 that the network can learn and extract but it would have been great to see or to think of really stack graph as a
01:42:54 giant graph that even also as the game evolves use kind of star trek taking branches and so on and we tried we read
01:43:00 a bit of research on these nothing too relevant but I I really like the idea and it has elements that are which
01:43:07 something you also worked with in terms of visualizing your networks as elements of having human interpretable being able
01:43:15 to generate knowledge representations that are human interpretable that maybe human experts can then tweak or at least
01:43:21 understand so there's there's a lot of interesting aspect there and for me personally I'm just a huge fan of
01:43:28 Wikipedia and it's it's a shame that our neural networks aren't taking advantage of all the structured knowledge that's
01:43:34 on the web what's next for for you what's next for deep mind what are you excited about what a four alpha star
01:43:42 yeah so I think the obvious next steps would be to apply alpha star to other races I mean that's sort of shows that
01:43:53 the algorithm works because we wouldn't want to have created by mistake something in the architecture that
01:43:59 happens to work for Protoss but not for other races right so as verification I think that's an obvious next step that
01:44:08 we are working on and then I would like to see so agents and players can specialize on
01:44:14 different skill sets that allow them to be very good I think we've seen alpha star understanding very well when to
01:44:21 take battles and when to not to do that do that also very good at micromanagement and moving the units
01:44:28 around and so on and also very good at producing non-stop and trading of economy with building units but I have
01:44:37 not perhaps seen as much as I would like this idea of the poker idea that you mentioned right I'm not sure Starcraft
01:44:44 or alpha star rather has developed a very deep understanding of what the opponent is doing and reacting to that
01:44:52 and sort of trying to to to trick the player to do something else or that you know so this kind of reasoning I would
01:44:59 like to see more so I think purely from a research standpoint there's perhaps also quite a few of you things to be
01:45:05 done there in the domain of StarCraft yeah in a domain of games I've seen some interesting work in sort of in even
01:45:13 auctions manipulating other players so forming a belief state and just messing with people yeah about theory of mind
01:45:21 yeah yeah yeah this is a theory of mine on star Kirby's kind of they're really made for each other
01:45:27 yeah so that would be very exciting to see those techniques applied to Starcraft or perhaps Starcraft driving
01:45:34 new techniques right as I said this is always the tension between the two well Oriol thank you so much for talking
