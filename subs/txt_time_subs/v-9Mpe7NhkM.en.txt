00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Gustav Sorum he's the chief research and development officer Spotify leading
00:00:09 their product design data technology and engineering teams as I've said before in my research and in life in general I
00:00:18 love music listening to it and creating it and using technology especially personalization through machine learning
00:00:25 to enrich the music discovery and listening experience that is what Spotify has been doing for years
00:00:32 continually innovating defining how we experience music as a society in the digital age that's what Gustav and I
00:00:38 talk about among many other topics including our shared appreciation of the movie true romance in my view one of the
00:00:47 great movies of all time this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it
00:00:54 five stars on iTunes support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter at lux Friedman spelled Fri D ma n and now
00:01:04 here's my conversation with Gustav Soros from Spotify has over 50 million songs in its catalogue so let me ask the
00:01:14 all-important question I feel like you're the right person to ask what is the definitive greatest song of all time
00:01:24 it varies for me personally she can't speak definitively for everyone I wouldn't believe very much in machine
00:01:33 learning if I did right because everyone had the same taste so for you what is you have to pick what is the song
00:01:40 alright so it's it's pretty easy for me there is this song called you're so cool Hans Zimmer soundtrack to true romance
00:01:48 it was a movie that made a big impression on me and it's kind of been following me through my life actually
00:01:56 had it play at my wedding I start with the organist and help them play it on an organ which was a pretty pretty
00:02:02 interesting experience that is probably my I would say top 3 movie of all time yeah it's just an incredible yeah and
00:02:10 then it came out during my formative years and as I've discovered in music you shape
00:02:16 your music taste during those years so it definitely affected me quite a bit did it affect you in any other kind of
00:02:22 way well the movie itself affected me back then it was a big part of culture I didn't really adopt any characters from
00:02:29 the movie about it it was a it was a great story of love fantastic actors and and you know really I didn't even know
00:02:36 who Hans Zimmer was at a time but fantastic music and so that song has followed me and the movie actually
00:02:44 follow me throughout my life that was a Quentin Tarantino actually I think director director produced that her so
00:02:51 it's not stairway to heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody so those are those are great they're not my personal favorites but 
00:02:57 but they're I realized that people have different tastes and that's it's a big part of what we do well for me I have to
00:03:06 stick with stairway to heaven so 35,000 years ago I looked this up on Wikipedia flute like instruments started being
00:03:13 used in caves as part of hunting rituals then primitive cultural gatherings things like that this is the birth of
00:03:20 music since then we had a few folks Beethoven Elvis Beatles Justin Bieber of course Drake so in your view let's
00:03:30 start like high level philosophical what is the purpose of music on this planet of ours I think music has many different
00:03:41 purposes I think there's there's certainly a big purpose which is the same as multiple attainment which is
00:03:50 ESCA pisum and to be able to live in some sort of other mental state for a while but I also think you have the the
00:03:55 opposite of escaping which is to help you focus on something you are actually doing and so I think people use music as
00:04:03 a tool to to tune the brain to the activities that they are actually doing and it's kind of like in one sense maybe
00:04:12 it's the rawest signal if you if you think about the brain that's known that works it's maybe the most efficient hack
00:04:18 we can do to actually actively tune it into some state that you want to be you can do it in other ways you can tell
00:04:23 stories to put people in a certain mood but music is probably very F to get to a certain mood very fast and
00:04:30 you know there's  there's a social component historically to music where people listen to music together I was
00:04:38 just thinking about this that to me you mentioned machine learning but to me personally music is a really private
00:04:47 thing I'm speaking for myself I listen to music like almost nobody knows the kind of things I have in my library
00:04:54 except people who are really close to me and they really only know a certain percentage there's like some weird stuff
00:05:00 that I'm almost probably embarrassed but by right it's called to give the pleasure everyone I said the guilty
00:05:05 pleasures yet hopefully they're not too bad but it's just the ice for me it's personal do you think of music is
00:05:13 something that's social or as something that's personal this is a very so I think it's the same it's the same answer
00:05:23 that you use it for for both we we've thought a lot about this during these 10 years at Spotify obviously in one sense
00:05:30 as you said music is incredibly social you go to concerts and so forth on the other hand it is your your escape and
00:05:40 everyone has these things are very personal to them so what we've found is that when it comes to to most people
00:05:50 claim that they have a friend or two that they are heavily inspired by and that they listen to so I actually think
00:05:56 music is very social but in a smaller group setting it's in it's an intimate form of of it's an intimate relationship
00:06:04 it's not something that you necessarily share broadly now at concerts you can argue you do but then you've gathered a
00:06:11 lot of people that you have something in common with I think this broadcast sharing on music it's something we tried
00:06:21 on social networks and so forth but it turns out that people aren't super interested in is what their friends
00:06:29 listen to they're interested in understanding if they have something in common crabs with a friend but not you
00:06:36 know not just as information right that that that's really interesting that was just
00:06:40 thinking about this morning listening to Spotify I really have a pretty intimate relationship was modified with my
00:06:50 playlists right I've had them for many years now and they've grown with me together there's there's an intimate
00:06:57 relationship you have with a library of music you've developed and we'll talk about different ways to play with that
00:07:05 can you do the impossible task and try to give a history of music listening from your perspective from before the
00:07:14 Internet and after the Internet and just kind of everything leading up to streaming Spotify I'll try it it could
00:07:22 be a 100 year podcast yeah I'll try to do a brief version there are some things that that I think are very interesting
00:07:28 during the history of music which is that before recorded music you to be able to enjoy music you actually had to
00:07:35 be where the music was produced because he couldn't he couldn't record it and time-shifted write creation and
00:07:40 consumption had to happen at the same time basically concerts and so you either had to get to the nearest village
00:07:48 to listen to music and while that was cumbersome and it severely limited the distribution of music it also had some
00:07:55 different qualities which was that the Creator could always interact with the audience it was always live and also there was no
00:08:02 time cap on the music so I think it's not a coincident that these early classical works they're much longer than
00:08:10 the three minutes the three minutes came in as a restriction of the first wax disc that could only contain a three
00:08:16 minute singsong on one side right so actually the recorded music severely limited there or could constraint I
00:08:23 won't say limit I mean constraints often good but it put very hard constraints on the music format so you kind of said
00:08:29 like instead of doing these this opus like many tens of minutes or something now you get three and a half minutes
00:08:36 because then you're out of wax on this disc but in return you get in amazing distribution you reach will widen right
00:08:45 just on that point real quick without the mass scale distribution there's a scarcity component where you kind of
00:08:52 look forward what we had that it's like the Netflix versus HBO Game of Thrones you like wait
00:09:01 for the event because you can't really listen to it see you're like look forward to it and then it's you derive
00:09:08 perhaps more pleasure because it's more rare for you to listen to particular piece you think there's value to that
00:09:14 scarcity yeah I think that that is definitely a thing and there's always this component of if you have something
00:09:20 in infinite amount so will you value it as much probably not humanity is always seeking some is relative so you're
00:09:28 always seeking something you didn't have and when you have it you don't appreciate as much I think that's
00:09:32 probably true but I think that's why concerts exist so you can actually have both but I think net if you couldn't
00:09:41 listen to music in your car driving that that'd be worse that cost will be bigger than the benefit of of the anticipation
00:09:49 I think that you would have so yep it started with live concerts then it's being able to you know the the
00:09:58 phonograph invented right you start to be able to record music exactly so then then you got this massive distribution
00:10:05 that that made it possible to create two things I think first of all cultural phenomenons they probably need
00:10:11 distribution to be able to happen but it also opened access to you know for a new kind of artists so you started to have
00:10:19 these phenomenons like Beatles inhale this and so forth that would really a function of distribution I think
00:10:24 obviously of talent and innovation but there was also taking a component and of course the next big innovation that come
00:10:31 along was was radio broadcast radio and I think radio is interesting because it started not as a music medium and
00:10:39 started us as an information medium for for news and then radio need to define something to fill the time wid so that
00:10:46 they could honestly play more ads and make more money and music was free so so then you had this massive distribution
00:10:53 we could program to people I think those things that ecosystem is what created the ability for for for hits but it was
00:11:03 also very broadcast medium so you would tend to get these massive massive hits but maybe not such a lot
00:11:10 tail in terms of choice of everybody listening to the same stuff yeah and as you said I think there are some social
00:11:16 benefits to that yeah I think for example there is there's a high statistical chance that if I talk about
00:11:21 the latest episode of Game of Thrones we have something to talk about yeah just statistically in the age of individual
00:11:27 choice maybe some of that goes away so I I do see the value of like you know shared cultural components but I also
00:11:38 obviously love personalization and so let's catch us up to the Internet so maybe Napster well first of all
00:11:45 there's like mp3's exact tape CDs there was a digitalization of music with a CD really it was physical distribution but
00:11:51 the music became did you don't yeah and so they were files but basically boxed software and use the software analogy
00:11:59 and then you could start downloading these files and I think there are two interesting things that happen back to
00:12:06 music used to be longer before it was constrained by the distribution medium I don't think that was a coincidence and
00:12:13 then really the only music genre to have developed mostly after music was a file again on the Internet is EDM and EDM is
00:12:20 often much longer than the traditional music I think I think it's interesting to think about the fact that music is no
00:12:27 longer constrained in minutes per song or something it's it's a it's a legacy of our own distribution technology and
00:12:33 you see some of this new music that that breaks the format not so much as I would have expected actually by now but but it
00:12:40 still happens so first of all I don't really know what EDM is electronic dance music yeah right you could say Avicii
00:12:48 was one of the biggest in this genre so the main constraint is of time something like three four or five minute songs
00:12:55 songs there were eight minutes ten minutes and so forth because the you know it started as a digital product
00:13:02 that you downloaded so you didn't have this this constraint anymore so I think it's something really interesting that I
00:13:09 don't think has fully happened yet we're kind of jumping ahead a little bit to where we are but I think there's there's
00:13:15 tons of formal innovation in music that should happen now that couldn't happen when you needed to
00:13:21 really adhere to the distribution constraints if you didn't adhere to that you will get no distribution so so jerk
00:13:27 for example Icelandic artist she made a full I pad app as an album that's very expensive
00:13:35 you know even though the App Store has great distribution she gets nowhere near the distribution versus staying within
00:13:43 the 3-minute format so I think now that music is fully digital inside these streaming services there is there is the
00:13:48 opportunity to change the format again and allow creators to be much more creative without limiting their their
00:13:55 distribution ability that's interesting that you're right it's surprising we don't see that taking advantage more
00:14:03 often it's almost like the constraints of the distribution from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture to where we want
00:14:13 the five three to five minutes on that anything else not just so we want the song as consumers and as artists like I
00:14:21 cuz I write a lot of music and I never even thought about writing something longer than 10 minutes that's it's
00:14:28 really interesting that those constraints because all your training data has been three minutes right it's
00:14:35 right okay so yes digitization of data later than mp3s yeah so I think you had this file then
00:14:44 that was distributed physically but then you had the components of digital distribution and then the internet
00:14:49 happened and there was this vacuum where you had a format that could be digitally shipped but there was no business model
00:14:57 and then all these pirate networks happen Napster and in pirate in Sweden Pirate Bay which was one of the biggest
00:15:06 and it you know I think from a consumer point of view which which kind of leads up to the inception of of Spotify from a
00:15:14 consumer point of view consumers for the first time had this access model to music where they could without kind of
00:15:23 any marginal costs they could they could try different tracks you could use music in in new ways there was no marginal
00:15:30 cost and that was a fantastic consumer experience that just all the music ever made I think was
00:15:35 fantastic but it was all so horrible for artists because there was no business model around it so they didn't make any
00:15:43 money so the user need almost drove the user interface before there was a business model and then there were these
00:15:50 download stores that allowed you to download files which was a solution but it didn't solve the access problem there
00:15:57 was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to try one more track and I think that that heavily limits how you listen to music
00:16:05 the example always give this you know in Spotify a huge amount of people listen to music while they sleep while they go
00:16:11 to sleep and while they sleep if that costed you $0.99 per three minutes you probably wouldn't do that and you would
00:16:17 be much less adventurous if there was a real dollar cost to exploring music so the access model is interesting in that
00:16:23 it changes your music behavior you can be you can take much more risk because there's no marginal cost to it maybe let
00:16:30 me linger on piracy for a second because I I find especially coming from Russia piracy is something that's very
00:16:41 interesting to me not me of course ever but my friends who partook in piracy of music software TV shows sporting events
00:16:55 and usually to me what that shows is not that they're they can actually pay the money and they're not trying to save
00:17:03 money they're choosing the best experience so what to me piracy shows is a business opportunity in all these
00:17:11 domains and that's where I think you're right spot if I stepped in is basically piracy was is an experience you can
00:17:20 explore was fine music you like and actually the interface of piracy isn't as horrible because it's I mean it's not
00:17:29 metadata yeah that metadata is long download times all kinds of stuff and what Spotify does is basically
00:17:37 first rewards artists and second makes the experience of exploring music much better I mean the same is true I think
00:17:45 for movies and so on this piracy reveals in the software space for example I'm a huge user and fan of Adobe products and
00:17:53 the there was much more incentive to pirate Adobe products before they went to a monthly subscription plan and now
00:18:01 all of the sudden that you used to pirate Adobe products that I know now actually pay gladly for
00:18:09 the monthly subscription I think you're right I think it's in it's a sign of an opportunity for product development and
00:18:17 that sometimes the there's a product market fit before there's a business model fit in product development I think
00:18:23 that that is that's a sign of it in in Sweden I think was a bit of both there was there was a culture where even had a
00:18:31 political party called the pirate party and this was during the time when when people said that you know information
00:18:37 should be free it's not was somehow wrong to charge for ones and zeros so I think people felt that artists should
00:18:45 probably make some money somehow else and you know concerts or something so at least in Sweden it was part really
00:18:51 social acceptance even at the political level and that but that also forced Spotify to compete with with free which
00:18:59 which I don't think would actually could have happen anywhere else in the world the music industry needed to be doing
00:19:04 bad enough to take that risk and Sweden was like a perfect testing ground it had government-funded
00:19:10 high-bandwidth low-latency broadband which meant that the product would work and it was also there was no music
00:19:17 revenue anyway so they were kind of like I don't think this is going to work but why not
00:19:22 so this product is one that I don't think could have happened in America there was large music market for example
00:19:27 so how do you compete with free because that's an interesting world of the Internet where most people don't like to
00:19:36 pay for things so Spotify steps in and tries to yes compete with free how do you do it so I think two things one is
00:19:44 people are starting to pay for things on the Internet I think one way to think about it was
00:19:50 that advertising was the first business model because no one would put a credit card on internet transactional with
00:19:55 Amazon was the second and maybe subscription is their third and if you look offline subscription is the biggest
00:20:01 those so that may still happen I think people are starting to pay but definitely back then we needed to
00:20:05 compete with free and the first thing you need to do is obviously to lower the price to free and then you need to be
00:20:13 better somehow and the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience on the on the actual performance the
00:20:22 latency of you know even if even if you had high bandwidth broadband it would still take you thirty Seconds to a
00:20:30 minute to download one of these tracks so the Spotify experience of starting within the perceptual limit of immediacy
00:20:38 about 250 milliseconds meant that the the whole trick was that felt as if you had downloaded all the part that it was
00:20:43 on your harddrive it was that fast even though it wasn't and it was still free but somehow you were actually still
00:20:51 being a legal citizen now that was the trick that's what if I managed to to pull off so yeah I've actually heard you
00:20:58 say this to write this and that was surprised that wasn't aware of it because I just took it for granted you
00:21:04 know whenever an awesome thing comes along you just like of course it has to be this way that that's exactly right
00:21:10 that it felt like the entire world's libraries at my fingertips because of that of that latency being reduced what
00:21:18 was the technical challenge in reducing Olli so there was a group of really really talented engineers one of them
00:21:26 called Ludwig freakiest he wrote the actually from Gothenburg he wrote the initial the uterine client which is kind
00:21:34 of an interesting backstory to Spotify you know that we have one of the top developers from from BitTorrent clients
00:21:41 as well so he wrote utorrent the world's smallest BitTorrent clients and then he he was acquired very early by daniel and
00:21:50 martin who found it spotify and they actually sold the u torrent client to BitTorrent but kept living so Spotify
00:21:57 had a lot of experience within peer-to-peer networking so the original innovation wasn't was a distribution
00:22:05 innovation where Spotify built an end-to-end media distribution system up until only a few years ago we actually
00:22:10 hosted all the music ourselves so we had both the server side in the cloud and that meant that we could do things
00:22:16 such as having a peer-to-peer solution to use local caching on the client-side because back then the world was mostly
00:22:23 desktop but we could also do things like hack the TCP protocols things like niggles algorithm for kind
00:22:30 of exponential back-off or ramp up and just go full throttle and optimize for latency at the cost of bandwidth and all
00:22:38 of this end-to-end control meant that we could do an experience that felt like a step change these days
00:22:46 we actually are on on GCP we don't host our own stuff and everyone is really fast these days so that was the initial
00:22:51 competitive advantage but then obviously you have to move on over time and that was I was over 10 years ago right that
00:22:58 was in 2008 the product was launched in Sweden it was in a beta I think 2007 and it was on the desktop right so his
00:23:05 desktop only there's no phone there was no phone the iPhone came out in 2008 but the App Store came out one year later I
00:23:13 think so the writing was on the wall but there was no phone yet you've mentioned that people would use Spotify to
00:23:21 discover the songs they liked and then they would torrent those songs just so they can copy it to their phone just
00:23:29 hilarious because I'm not torrent quiet it seriously piracy does seem to be and like a good guide for business models
00:23:38 video content as far as I know Spotify doesn't have video content well we do have music videos and we do have videos
00:23:45 on the on the service but the way we think about ourselves is that we're an audio service and we think that if you
00:23:53 look at the amount of time that people spend on audio it's actually very similar to the amount of time that's
00:23:59 people spend on video so the opportunity should be equally big but today is not at all valued videos value much higher
00:24:07 so we think it's basically completely undervalues we think of ourselves as an audio service but within that audio
00:24:13 service I think video can make a lot of sense I think for when you're when you're discovering an artist you
00:24:18 probably do want to see them and understand who they are to understand their identity you won't see the video
00:24:23 every time now 90% of the time the phone is gonna be in your pocket for podcasters you use video I think
00:24:29 that can make a ton of sense so we do have video but we're an audio service where think of it as we call it
00:24:35 internally background able video video that is helpful but isn't isn't the driver of the narrative I think also if
00:24:44 we look at YouTube the way people there's quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTube
00:24:50 so in some sense YouTube was a bit of a competitor to to Spotify which is very strange to me that people use YouTube to
00:24:58 listen to music they play essentially the music videos right but don't watch the videos and put it in their pocket
00:25:06 well I think I think it's similar to to what strange I mean it's similar to what we were for the piracy networks know
00:25:17 where YouTube for historical reasons have a lot of music videos so you use people use YouTube for a lot of the
00:25:24 discovery part of the process I think but then it's not a really good sort of quote unquote mp3 player because it
00:25:30 doesn't even background then you have to keep the app in the foreground so so the consumption on a good consumption tool
00:25:36 but it's a decently good discoveries I mean I think YouTube is fantastic products and I use it for all kinds of
00:25:42 purposes so if I were to admit something I do use YouTube a little bit for the discovery to assistant discovery process
00:25:49 of songs and then if I like it I'll add it just fine that's okay that's okay with that ok so sorry we're jumping
00:25:57 around a little bit so the it's kind of incredible you look at Napster you look at the early days of Spotify how do you
00:26:05 one fascinating points how do you grow a user base see their ins in Sweden you have an idea I saw the initial sketches
00:26:15 that look terrible how do you grow user base from all from a few folks to millions I think there are a bunch of
00:26:23 tactical answers so first of all I think you need a great product I don't think you take a bad product and and market it
00:26:30 to be successful so you need a great product but sorry to interrupt but it's a totally new way to listen to music too
00:26:36 so it's not just did people realize immediately that Spotify is a great product I think they did so back to the point of
00:26:43 pyrazine it was a totally new way to listen to music illegally but people had been used to the access model in Sweden
00:26:49 and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy so one way to think about Spotify it was just legal and fast
00:26:55 piracy yeah and so people have been using it for a long time so they weren't alien to it they didn't really
00:27:01 understand how it could be legal because it was seemed too fast and too good to be true yeah which i think is a great
00:27:06 product proposition if you can be too good to be true but what I saw again and again was people showing each other
00:27:12 clicking the song showing how fast it started and saying I can't believe this yeah so I really think it was about
00:27:20 speed then we also had an invite product program that was there was really meant for scaling because we hosted our own
00:27:25 service we needed as a control scaling but that built a lot of expectation and I don't want to say hype because I hype
00:27:35 implies that it was that it wasn't true excitement around the product and we've replicated that when we launched in the
00:27:42 in the US we also built up and it might only program first there are lots of tactics but I think you need a you need
00:27:48 a great product that solves some problem and B basically the key innovation there was technology but on a method level the
00:27:56 innovation was really the access model versus the ownership model and that was tricky a lot of people said that they I
00:28:04 mean they wanted to own their music they would never kind of rent it or borrow it but I think the fact that we had a free
00:28:11 tier which meant that you get to keep this music for life as well helped quite a lot so this is an
00:28:17 interesting psychological point maybe you can speak to it was a big shift for me like I get to it's almost like a I go
00:28:26 to therapy for this is  I think I would describe my early listening experience and I think a lot of my
00:28:32 friends do is basically hoarding music is your like slowly one song by one song or maybe albums gathering a collection
00:28:41 of music that you love and you own it it's like awful especially with CDs or tape you like physically had it and and
00:28:49 what Spotify what I had to come to grips with it was kind of liberating actually is to throw away all the music I've had
00:28:59 this therapy session yes people and I think the mental trick is so actually we seen the user data once what if I
00:29:05 started a lot of people did the exact same thing they started hoarding as if the music would disappear right almost
00:29:12 the equivalent of downloading and so you know we had these playlists that had limits of like a few hundred thousand
00:29:17 tracks which we no one will ever like well they do needs and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks and to
00:29:24 this day you know some people want to actually save code and coordinate play the entire catalog but I think that the
00:29:30 therapy session goes something like instead of throwing away your music if you took your files and you store them
00:29:40 in the locker at Google it'd be a streaming service it's just that in that locker you have all the world's music
00:29:44 now for free so instead of giving away your music you got all the music it's yours it's a you could think of it at
00:29:50 having a copy of the world's catalogue that forever so you actually got more music instead of less it's just that you
00:29:57 just took that hard disk and you sent it to to someone who stored it for you and once you go through that mental journey
00:30:03 I'm like still my files they're just over there and I just have 40 million other 50 million or something now then
00:30:08 people are like okay that's good the problem is I think because you paid us a subscription if we hadn't had the
00:30:15 free tier where you would feel like even if I don't want to pay anymore I still get to keep them you keep your playlist
00:30:20 forever they don't disappear even though you stopped paying I think that was really important if we would have
00:30:26 started us you know you can put in all this time but if you stopped paying you lose all your work I think that would
00:30:31 have been a big challenge and what's the big challenge for a lot of our competitors that's another reason why I
00:30:36 think the free tier is really important that people need to feel the security that the work they put in it will never
00:30:41 disappear even if they decide not to pay I like how you put the work you put in I she stopped even think of it that way I
00:30:48 just actually Spotify taught me to just enjoy music I'm sorry as opposed as opposed to what I was doing before which
00:30:56 is like in an unhealthy way hoarding music which I found that because I was doing that I was listening to a small
00:31:05 selection of songs way too much to our where I was getting sick of them whereas Spotify the more liberating kind of
00:31:12 approaches I was just enjoying of course I listened to stairway to heaven over and over but because of the extra
00:31:18 variety I don't get as sick of them there is an interesting statistic I saw that so
00:31:24 Spotify has maybe you can correct me but over 50 million songs tracks and over three billion playlists so yes a million
00:31:35 songs and three billion playlists 60 times more playlists what do you make of that yeah so the way I think about it is
00:31:46 that from a from is that the station or machine learning point of view you have all these if you only thing about
00:31:52 reinforcement learning where you have this state space of all the tracks and you can take different journeys through
00:32:00 this through this world and these I think of these is like people helping themselves and each other creating
00:32:07 interesting vectors through this space of tracks and then it's not so surprising that across you know many
00:32:14 tens of millions of kind of atomic units there will be billions of paths that make sense and we're probably pretty
00:32:21 quite far away from having found all of them so kind of our job now is users when Spotify started it was really a
00:32:29 search box that was for that time pretty powerful and then I'd like to refer to that this programming language called
00:32:35 play listing where if you as you probably were pretty good at music you knew your new releases you knew your
00:32:40 backyard law you knew your stairway to heaven you could create a soundtrack for yourself using this playlist thing - oh
00:32:45 that's like meta programming language for music - sounds like your life and people who were good at music it's back
00:32:51 to how do you scale the product for people who are good at music that wasn't actually enough if you had the catalog
00:32:57 in a good search tool and you can create your own sessions you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire
00:33:03 life probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself but the problem was most people many people
00:33:08 aren't that good at music they just can't spend the time even if you're very good at news it's gonna be hard to keep
00:33:14 up so what we did to try to scale this was to essentially try to build you can think of them as a
00:33:21 instead there's this friend that some people had that helped them navigate this music catalog that's what we're
00:33:28 trying to do for you but also there is something like 200 million active users on Spotify so there it's okay so from
00:33:39 the machine learning perspective you have these 200 million people plus they're creating it's really interesting
00:33:52 to think of playlist as I mean I don't know if you meant it that way but it's almost like a programming language it's
00:33:59 a released a trace of exploration of those individual agents of the the listeners and you have all this new
00:34:07 tracks coming in so it's a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning so that is there is it is it possible
00:34:19 how can playlist be used as data in terms of machine learning and just to help Spotify organize the music so we
00:34:29 found in our data not surprising that people who play listed lots they retain much better they had a great experience
00:34:36 and so our first attempt was to playlist for users and so we acquired this company called tune ego of editors and
00:34:43 professional playlist errs and kind of leverage the maximum of human intelligence to help to help build kind
00:34:51 of these vectors through the track space for four people and that that broaden the product then the obvious next and we
00:34:59 you know use statistical means where they could see what when they created a playlist how did that play this perform
00:35:05 you know they could see skips of the songs they could see how the songs perform and they manually iterated the
00:35:11 playlist to maximize performance for a large group of people but there were never enough editors to playlist for you
00:35:17 personally so the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personalization using editors and tools
00:35:24 into statistics to individualization and then what's so interesting about the 3 billion playlist we have is we ended the
00:35:32 truth is we lucked out this was not a priori strategy as is often the case it looks really smart in hindsight was
00:35:39 as dumb luck we looked at these playlists and we had some people in the company a person named their grandson it
00:35:46 was really good at machine learning already back in in back then in like 2007-2008 back then it was mostly
00:35:54 collaborative filtering you so forth but we realized that what what this is is people are grouping tracks for
00:36:01 themselves that have some semantic meaning to them and then they actually label it with a playlist name as well so
00:36:09 in a sense people were grouping tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them and so could you could you use that
00:36:17 information to find that that latent embedding and so we started playing around with collaborative filtering and
00:36:26 we saw tremendous success with it basically trying to extract some of these some of these dimensions and and
00:36:32 if you think about it's not surprising at all it'd be quite surprising if playlists were actually random if they
00:36:40 had no semantic meaning for most people they group these tracks for some reason so we just happen to cross this
00:36:46 incredible data set where people are taking taken these tens of millions of tracks and group them along different
00:36:54 semantic vectors and the semantics being outside the individual users it's some kind of universal there's a universal
00:37:01 embedding that holds across people on this earth yes I do think that the embeddings you finally gonna be
00:37:08 reflective of the people who play listed so if if you have a lot of indie lovers who playlist your embed is going to
00:37:15 perform better there but what we found was that yes there were these these latent similarities they were very
00:37:23 powerful and we we had them it was interesting because I think that the people who play listed the most
00:37:30 initially were this so-called music aficionados who who really into music and they often had a certain they're
00:37:37 tasteful stuff is often certain geared towards a certain type of music and so what surprised us if you look at the
00:37:43 problem from the outside you might expect that the algorithms would start performing
00:37:49 best with mainstreamers first because it somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream tastes than really
00:37:55 particular tastes it was the complete opposite for us the recommendations performed fantastically for people who
00:38:01 saw themselves as having very unique taste that's probably because all of them playlist ed and they didn't perform
00:38:06 so well for mainstream is they actually thought they were a bit too particular and unorthodox so we had the complete
00:38:13 opposite of what we expected success within the hardest problem first and then had to try to scale to more
00:38:20 mainstream recommendations so you've also acquired echo nests that analyze a song data so in your view maybe you can
00:38:31 talk about so what kind of data is there from a machine learning perspective there's a like a huge amount what we're
00:38:37 talking about playlists thing and just user data of what people are listening to the playlists are constructing and so
00:38:46 on and then there's the the actual data within a song what makes a song I don't know the actual waveforms right is there
00:38:56 any how do you mix the two how much values are in each to me it seems like user data is well it's a romantic notion
00:39:04 that the song itself would contain useful information but if I were to guess user data would be much more
00:39:10 powerful like playlists would be much more powerful yeah so we use both our biggest success initially what was with
00:39:19 playlist data without understanding anything about the structure of this song but when we acquire the echo nest
00:39:26 they had the inverse problem they actually didn't have any play data they were just they were a provider of
00:39:31 recommendations but they didn't actually have any play data so they they looked at the structure of songs sonically and
00:39:39 they looked at Wikipedia for cultural references and so forth right cool and did a lot of NLU and so forth so we got
00:39:45 that skill into the company and combine kind of our user data with their with their kind of content-based so you can
00:39:54 think of as we were used to based and they were content based in their recommendations and we combine those two
00:39:58 and for some cases where you have a new there's no no play date obviously you have to try to go by either you know who
00:40:07 the artist is or or the sonic information in the song or what it's similar to so there's definitely value
00:40:13 in in both and we do a lot in both but I would say yes the user data captures things that that have to do with culture
00:40:20 in the greater society that you would never see in the in the content itself but that said we have seen we have a
00:40:29 research lab in Paris when you know we can talk about more about that on kind of machine layer on the creator side
00:40:34 what it can do for creators not just for the consumers but where we looked at how does the structure of a song actually
00:40:41 affect the listening behavior and it turns out that there is a lot of we can we can predict things like skips based
00:40:48 on we you know based on on the song itself we could say that maybe you should move that chorus a bit because
00:40:52 you're skippers gonna go up here there is a lot of latent structure in the music which is not surprising because it
00:40:59 is some sort of mind hack so there should be structured that's probably what we respond to you just blew my mind
00:41:03 actually for from the creator perspective so that's really interesting topic that probably most creators aren't
00:41:12 taking advantage of right so there's I've recently got to interact with a few folks youtubers who are like obsessed
00:41:24 with this idea of what do I do to make sure people keep watching the video and then like look at the analytics of which
00:41:33 point if people turn off and so on first of all don't think that's healthy but it's it's because you can do it a little
00:41:39 too much but it is a really powerful tool for helping the creative process you just made me realize you could do
00:41:48 the same thing for creation of music and so is that something you've looked into oh is it can you speak to how much
00:41:55 opportunity there is for that yeah I think I listen to to the podcast with Suraj yeah and I thought it was
00:42:01 fantastic and directed to do the same thing where he said and he said he posted something in the morning
00:42:06 yeah immediately watch the feedback where the drop off was and then responded to that in the afternoon
00:42:11 yeah which which is quite different from how people make podcasts for example yes exactly I mean the feedback loop is
00:42:17 almost non-existent it's very so if we back out a one-level I think actually both for music and podcasts which we
00:42:25 also do is let Spotify I think there's a tremendous opportunity just for the creation workflow and I think it's
00:42:32 really interesting speaking to you who because you're a musician a developer and a podcaster if you think about those
00:42:40 three different roles if you if you make the leap as a musician if you if you think about it as a software tool chain
00:42:47 really your door with the stems that's the IDE right that's what you work in source code formant with your
00:42:54 with with what you're creating then you sit around and you play with that and when you're happy you compile that thing
00:42:59 into some sort of you know AAC or mp3 or something you do that because you get distribution there's so many runtimes
00:43:04 for that mp3 across the world and Carstairs and stuff so you kind of compile this executable you ship it out
00:43:09 and kind of an old fashioned box software analogy and then you hope for the best right right but as a as a as a
00:43:19 software developer you'd never do that first you go and get helping you collaborate with other Creators yeah and
00:43:24 then you know you think it'd be crazy to just ship one version of your software without doing an a/b test without any
00:43:31 feedback loop and then HD tracking exactly and then you would you would look at the feedback loops and try to
00:43:37 optimize that thing right so I think if you think of it as a as a very specific software tool chain it looks quite
00:43:44 arcane you know the tools that a music creator has versus what a software developer has so that's kind of how we
00:43:52 think about it and why wouldn't a why wouldn't a music creator have something like github you could collaborate much
00:43:57 more easily so we have we bought this company called sound trap which has a kind of Google Docs for music approach
00:44:04 where you can collaborate with other people on the kind of source code format with stamps and I think introducing
00:44:11 things like AI tools there to help you as you're creating music both in in helping you you know
00:44:21 put accompaniment your music like drums or something help you master and mix automatically help you understand how
00:44:30 this track will perform exactly what you would expect as a software developer I think makes a lot of sense and I think
00:44:36 the same goes for a podcaster I think podcasters will expect to have the same kind of feedback loop that Siraj has
00:44:43 like why wouldn't you maybe maybe it's not healthy but sorry I wanted to criticize the fact cuz you can overdo it
00:44:50 because a lot of the each and we're in a new era of that so you can become addicted to it and therefore what people
00:45:01 say you become a slave to the YouTube algorithm are sort of it's a it's always a danger of a new technology as opposed
00:45:09 to say if you're creating a song becoming too obsessed about the intro riff to the song that keeps people
00:45:18 listening versus actually the entirety of the creation process it's a balance absolutely but the fact that there's
00:45:23 zero I mean you're blowing my mind right now because you're completely right that there is no signal whatsoever there's no
00:45:31 feedback whatsoever in the creation process and music or podcasting almost at all and are you saying that Spotify
00:45:42 is hoping to help create tools to not tools but no tools actually actually tools from traders absolutely so we have
00:45:52 we've remains micro stations the last few years around music creation this company called soundtrap which is the
00:45:58 door digital audio workstation but that is browser-based and that their focus was really the Google Docs approach
00:46:02 where you can collaborate with people much more easily then you could in previous tools so we have some of these
00:46:08 tools that we're working with that we want to make accessible and then we can connect it with our with our consumption
00:46:14 data we can create this feedback loop where we could help you understand we could help you create and help you
00:46:22 understand how you will perform we also acquired this other company within podcasting called anchor which is one of
00:46:28 the biggest podcasting tools mobile focused so really focused on simple creation or easy access to create
00:46:35 but that also gives us this feedback loop and even before that we invested in something called Spotify for artists and
00:46:44 Spotify for podcasters which is an app that you can download you can verify that you are that creator and then you
00:46:51 get you get things that you know software developers have had for years you can see where if you look at your
00:46:57 podcast for example on Spotify or or a song that you released you can see how it's performing which cities is
00:47:02 performing and who is listening to it what's the demographic break up so similar in the sense that you can
00:47:08 understand how you're actually doing on the on the platform so we we definitely want to build tools I think you also
00:47:16 interviewed the head of research for Adobe and I think that's an item back to photoshop that you like I think that's
00:47:24 an interesting analogy as well Photoshop I think has been very innovative in helping photographers and artists and I
00:47:32 think there should be the same kind of tools for for music creators where you could get you know AI assistants for
00:47:39 example that's you creating music as you can do with with Adobe where you can I want to sky over here and you can get
00:47:44 help creating that sky the really fascinating thing is what Adobe doesn't have is a distribution for the content
00:47:54 you create so you don't have the data of if I create if I  you know whatever creation I'm making Photoshop a premiere
00:48:03 I can't get like immediate feedback like I can on YouTube for example about the way people are responding and if Spotify
00:48:10 is creating those tools that that's a really exciting actually world but let's talk a little about podcast it's so I
00:48:22 have trouble talking to one person so it's a bit terrifying and kind of hard to fathom but an average sixty to a
00:48:30 hundred thousand people will listen to this episode okay so it's intimidating it's intimidating
00:48:39 so I hosted on blueberry I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly actually it looks like most people listen to an
00:48:46 Apple podcast cashbox and pocket gas and only about a thousand listen on Spotify in just my podcast right so
00:48:59 where do you see a time when Spotify will dominate this so Spotify is relatively new into this podcasting talk
00:49:07 nesting site yeah in podcasting what's the deal with podcasting and Spotify how serious is Spotify about podcasting do
00:49:15 you see a time where everybody would listen to you know probably a huge amount of people majority perhaps listen
00:49:23 to music on Spotify do you see a time when the same is true for podcasting well I certainly hope so
00:49:30 that is our mission our mission as a company is actually to enable a million creators to live off of their art in a
00:49:36 billion people inspired by it and what I think it is interesting about that mission is it actually puts the crater's
00:49:41 first even though it's not as a consumer focused company and it says to be able to live off of their art not just make
00:49:48 some money or further art as well so it's quite an ambitious project and so we think about creators of all kinds and
00:49:57 we kind of expanded our mission from being music - being audio a while back and that's not so much because we think
00:50:09 we made that decision we think that my decision was was made for us we need the world made that decision
00:50:15 whether we like it or not when you put in your headphones you're gonna make a choice between music and new episode of
00:50:24 of your podcast or something else right we're in that world whether we like it or not
00:50:28 and that you know that's how radio work so we decided that we think it's about audio you can see the rise of audiobooks
00:50:35 and so forth we think audio is this great opportunity so we decided to enter it and and obviously Apple and Apple
00:50:44 podcast is absolutely dominating in podcasting and we didn't have a single podcast only like two years ago
00:50:54 what we did though was we we we looked at this and said no can we bring something to this you know we want to do
00:50:59 this but the back to the Josefa we have to do something that consumers actually value to be able to
00:51:06 do this and the reason we've gone from not existing at all to being the the record of what quite a wide margin the
00:51:13 second-largest podcast consumption still still wide gap to iTunes but we're growing quite fast I think it's because
00:51:19 when we when we looked at the consumer problem people said surprisingly that they wanted their podcasts and music in the
00:51:28 same in the same application so what we did was we took a little bit of a different approach what we said instead
00:51:33 of building a separate podcast app we thought it's their consumer problem to solve here because the others are very
00:51:38 successful already and we thought there was in making a more seamless experience where you can have your podcast in your
00:51:45 music in the same application because we think it's audio to you and that that has been successful and that meant that
00:51:51 we actually had 200 million people to offer this to instead of starting from 0 so I think we have a good chance because
00:51:57 we're taking a different approach than the competition and back to the other thing I mentioned about creators because
00:52:05 we're looking at the end-to-end flow I think there's a tremendous amount of innovation to do around podcast as a
00:52:11 format when we have creation tools and consumption I think we could start improving what podcasting is I mean
00:52:19 podcast is this this opaque big like 1/2 hour file that you're streaming which it really doesn't make that much sense in
00:52:27 2019 that it's not interactive there's no feedback loops nothing like that so I think if we're gonna win it's gonna have
00:52:32 to be because we build a better product for creators and for for consumers so we'll see but it's certainly our goal we
00:52:38 have a long way to go well the creators part is really exciting you ready you got me hooked
00:52:44 there is the only stats I have a blueberry just recently added the stats of whether it's listened to the end or
00:52:53 not and that's like a huge improvement but that's still nowhere to where you could possibly go into her statistics
00:53:00 you just download this pot of five podcasters up and verify and then then you know where people dropped out in
00:53:06 this episode oh wow ok the moment I started talking okay I might be depressed by this but okay so one one
00:53:13 other question the original Spotify for music and I have a question about podcasting in this
00:53:25 line is the idea of albums I have what did you use ik aficionados a friends who are really big fans of music often
00:53:34 really enjoy albums listening to entire albums of an artist and correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like Spotify has
00:53:43 helped replace the idea of an album with playlists so you create your own albums it's kind of the way at least I've
00:53:50 experienced music and I have really enjoy it that way one of the things that was missing in podcasting for me I don't
00:53:57 know if it's missing I don't know it's an open question for me but the way I listen to podcasts is the way I would
00:54:03 listen to albums so I take Joe Rogan experience and that's an album and I listen you know I like I put that on and
00:54:11 I listen one episode after the next and there's a sequence and so on is there a room for doing what you did for music or
00:54:20 doing what about if I did for music but creating playlists sort of this kind of play listing idea of breaking apart from
00:54:30 podcasting from individual podcasts and creating kind of this interplay or Debbie thought about that space it's a
00:54:39 great question so I think in in music you're right basically you bought an album so it was like you bought a small
00:54:44 catalog of like 10 tracks right it was it was again it was actually a lot of a lot of consumption you think it's about
00:54:50 what you like but it's based on the business model right so you paid for this 10 track yeah service and then you
00:54:55 listened to that for a while and then when everything was flat priced you tended to listen differently now so
00:55:02 so I think the I think the album is still tremendously important that's why we have it and you can save albums and
00:55:06 so forth and you have a huge amount of people who really listen according to albums and I like that because it is a
00:55:11 creator format you can tell a longer story over several tracks and so some people listen to just one track some
00:55:17 people actually want to hear that whole story now in podcast I think I think it's different you can argue
00:55:26 that podcasts might be more like shows on Netflix you have like a full season of of narcos and you're probably not
00:55:32 going to do like one episode of Marcos and then one of house of cards like you know that there's a narrative there and
00:55:39 you you you love the cast and you love these chairs so I think people will people love shows and I think they will
00:55:47 they will listen to those shows I do think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time so there's certainly an
00:55:51 opportunity to bring you the latest episode of you know whatever that 5 6 10 things that that you're into but but I
00:55:59 think I think people are gonna listen to specific hosts and love those hosts for a long time because I think there's
00:56:08 something different with podcast where this format of the the experience of the of the audience is actually sitting here
00:56:16 right between us whereas if you look at something on TV the audio actually would come from
00:56:20 you would sit over there the order would come to you from both of us as if you were watching notice you were part of
00:56:25 the conversation so my experience is I mean listen to podcasts like yours and Joe Rogan is I feel like I know all of
00:56:32 these people they they have no idea who I am but I feel like you know so many artists and that it's very different
00:56:38 from me watching a watching like a TV show or an interview so I think you you kind of fall in love with people and
00:56:46 experience in a different way so I think I think shows and hosts are gonna be very very important I don't think that's
00:56:51 gonna go away in just some sort of thing where well you don't even know who you're listening to I don't think that's
00:56:56 gonna happen what I do think is I think there's a tremendous discovery opportunity in podcast because the
00:57:04 catalog is growing quite quickly and I think podcast is only a few like five six hundred thousand shows right now if
00:57:13 you look back to YouTube as another in knowledge of creators no one really knows if you would lift the lid on
00:57:19 YouTube but it's probably billions of episodes and so I think the podcast catalog would probably grow tremendously
00:57:26 because the creation tools are getting easier and then you're gonna have this discovery opportunity that I think is
00:57:32 really big so so a lot of people tell me that they love their shows but discovering podcasts kind of suck
00:57:38 it's really hard to get into new show they're usually quite long it's a big time investments I think there's plenty
00:57:44 of opportunity in the discovery part yeah for sure a hundred percent in in even the dumbest there's so many
00:57:55 low-hanging fruit too for example just knowing what episode to listen to first to try out a podcast exactly because
00:58:03 most podcasts don't have an order to them they they can be listening to out of order and sorry to say some are
00:58:13 better than others episodes so some episodes of Joe Rogan are better than others and it's nice to know which you
00:58:20 should listen to to try it out and there's as far as I know almost no information in terms of like up votes on
00:58:29 how good an episode is exactly so I think part of the problem is you it's kind of like music there isn't one
00:58:35 answer people use music for different things and there's actually many different types of music there's workout
00:58:39 music and there's classical piano music and focus music and and and so forth I think the same with podcasts some
00:58:45 podcasts are sequential they're supposed to be listened to in in order it's actually it's actually telling a
00:58:53 narrative some podcasts are one topic kind of like yours but different guests so you could jump in anywhere some potes
00:58:59 I have completely different topics and for those podcasts it might be that I want you know we should recommend one
00:59:06 episode because it's about AI yeah from someone but then they talk about something that you're not interested in
00:59:11 the rest of the episodes so I think or well we're spending a lot of time on now it's just first understanding the domain
00:59:17 and creating kind of the knowledge graph of how do these objects relate and how do people consume and I think we'll find
00:59:24 that it's gonna be it's gonna be different I'm excited is it your the Spotify is the first
00:59:33 people I'm aware of that are trying to do this for podcasting podcasting has been like a Wild West
00:59:40 up until now it's been a very we want to be very careful though because it's been a very good Wild West I think is this
00:59:46 fragile ecosystem and I you we want to make sure that you don't barge in and say like oh we're
00:59:54 gonna internalize this thing and you have to think about the the creators you have to understand how they get
01:00:00 distribution today who listens to how they make money today started you know make sure that their business model
01:00:06 works that they understand the I think it's back to doing something improving their products like feedback loops and
01:00:15 distribution so jumping back into terms of this fascinating world of recommender system and listening to music and using
01:00:22 machine learning to analyze things do you think it's better to what currently correct me if I'm wrong but currently
01:00:31 Spotify lets people pick what they listen to the most part there's a discovery process but you kind of
01:00:39 organize playlists is it better to let people pick what they listen to or recommend what they should listen to
01:00:46 something like stations by Spotify that I saw that you're playing around with maybe you can tell me what's the status
01:00:53 of that this is a Pandora style app that just kind of as opposed to you select the music you listen to it kind of feeds
01:01:02 you music you listen to what's the status of stations by Spotify what's its future the store is modify as we have
01:01:08 grown has been that we made it more accessible to different different audiences and stations is another one of
01:01:17 those where the question is some people want to be very specific they actually want to hear stairway to heaven right now
01:01:23 that needs to be very easy to do and some people or even the same person at some point might say I want to feel up
01:01:31 beats or I want to feel happy or I want songs to sing in the car alright so they put in they put in the information in a
01:01:37 very different level and then we need to translate that into that what that means musically so stations is a test to to
01:01:44 create like a consumption input vector that is much simpler where you can just tune in a little bit and see if that
01:01:49 increases the overall reach but we're trying to kind of serve the entire gamut of super-advanced so-called music
01:01:59 aficionados all the way to to people who they love listening to music but it's it not their number-one priority in life
01:02:04 right they're not going to sit and follow every new release from every new artist they need to be able to to
01:02:10 influence music at a at a at a different level so we're trying you can think of it as different products and I think
01:02:16 when one of them one of the interesting things to answer your question on if it's better to lift the user to soar to
01:02:24 play I think the answer is the the challenge when you when machine learning kind of came along there was a lot of
01:02:29 thinking about what this product development mean in a machine learning context people like Andrew Aang for
01:02:38 example when I went to buy do I started doing a lot of practical machine learning went from academia and you know
01:02:42 he thought a lot about this and he had this notion that you know product manager designer an engine they used to
01:02:48 work around this wireframe I kind of described what the product should look like who some talk about when you're
01:02:52 doing like a chatbot or a playlist how do you what are you gonna say like it should be good that's not a good product
01:02:58 description so how do you how do you do that he came up with this notion that the test set is the new wireframe the
01:03:04 the job of the product manager is to source a good test set that is representative of what like if you say
01:03:10 like I want to play the status songs missing in the car job the product managers go in source like a good test
01:03:16 out of what that means then you can work with engineering to have algorithms to try to produce that right so we try to
01:03:22 think a lot about how to structure product development for for a machine learning age and and what we discovered
01:03:29 was that a lot of it is actually in the expectation and you can go you can go let's say that if you if you set the
01:03:40 expectation with the user that this is a discovery product like discover weekly you're actually setting the expectation
01:03:45 that most of all we show you will not be relevant when you're in the discovery process you're gonna accept that
01:03:51 actually if you find one gem every Monday that you totally love you're probably gonna be happy even though the
01:03:58 statistical meaning one out of ten is terrible or one out of twenty is terrible from a user point of view
01:04:02 because the studying was discoveries fine can I get a sorry to interrupt real quick I just actually learned about
01:04:09 discover weekly which is a Spotify I don't know it's it's a feature a Spotify that shows you cool songs to listen I
01:04:18 maybe I can do issue tracking I couldn't find them my Spotify app it's in your library it's in the library it's in the
01:04:24 list of life cuz I was like whoa is just cool I didn't know this existed and I try to find it but I'll show it to you
01:04:34 back product yeah but yeah it's a so yes I just  just to mention the expectation there is basically they
01:04:42 you're going to discover in your song yes so then you can be quite adventurous in in the recommendations you do but but
01:04:49 if you're but we have another product called daily mix which kind of implies that these are only going to be your
01:04:55 favorites so if you have one out of ten that is good and nine out of ten that doesn't work for you you're gonna think
01:05:00 it's a horrible product so actually a lot of the product development we learned over the years it's about
01:05:04 setting the right expectation so for daily mix you know algorithmically we would pick among things that feel very
01:05:11 safe in your taste space there's discover weekly we go kind of well because the expectation is most of this
01:05:17 is not gonna so a lot of that a lot of times of your question there a lot of should you let the user pick or not it
01:05:24 depends we have some products where the whole point is that the user can click play put the phone in the pocket and it
01:05:29 should be really good music for like an hour we have other products where you probably need to say like no no say no
01:05:37 no and it's very interactive I see that makes sense and then the radio product the station's product is one of these
01:05:42 like click Play put in your pocket four hours that's really interesting so you're thinking of different test sets
01:05:49 for differ users interact create products that sort of optimize optimize for those test sets
01:05:57 that represents a specific set of users yes I think one thing that I think is interesting is we we invested quite
01:06:06 heavily in editorial in in people creating playlists using a statistical data and I was successful for us and
01:06:12 then we also invested in in machine learning and for the longest time you know within Spotify and within the rest
01:06:18 of the industry there was always this narrative of humans versus the machine how go versus editorial and an editors
01:06:26 would would say like well if I had that data if I could see your playlist in history and I made a choice for you I
01:06:32 would have made a better choice and they would have because they honest they're much smarter than these algorithms the
01:06:37 human is incredibly smart compared to our algorithms they can take culture into account and so forth the problem is
01:06:43 that they can't make 200 million decisions you know per hour for every user that logs in so the algo may be not
01:06:51 as sophisticated but much more efficient so there was this there was this contradiction but then a few years ago
01:06:58 we started focusing on this kind of human-in-the-loop thinking around machine learning and we actually coined
01:07:04 an internal term for it called algo toriel combination of algorithms and and editors where if we take a concrete
01:07:12 example you think of the editor there's this paid expert that we have there's really good at something like so hip-hop
01:07:21 EDM something right there a true expert no and one in the industry so they have all the cultural knowledge you think of
01:07:29 them as the product manager and you say that let's say that you want to create a you think that there's a there's a
01:07:35 product need in the world for something like songs to sing in the car or someone sitting in the shower and I'm taking
01:07:39 that example because it exists people love yeah The Scream songs in the car when they drive right yeah so you want
01:07:45 to create that product and you have this product manager if it's a musical expert they create they come up with a concept
01:07:50 like I think this is a missing thing in in humanity like upside it's called song sitting in the car they they create the
01:07:58 framing the image the title and they create a test set or they create a group of songs like a few thousand songs
01:08:04 out of the catalogue that they manually curate that our known songs that are great to sing in the car and they can
01:08:10 take like to romance into account they understand things that our algorithms do not at all so they have this huge set of
01:08:16 tracks then when we deliver that to you we look at your taste vectors and you get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing
01:08:23 in the car in your taste so you have you have personalization and editorial input in the same process if that makes sense
01:08:31 yeah it makes total sense and I have several questions around that this is a this is like fascinating okay so first
01:08:41 it is a little bit surprising to me that the world expert humans are outperforming machines at specifying
01:08:53 songs to sing in the car so maybe you could talk to that a little bit I don't know if you can put it into words but
01:09:00 what is it how difficult is this problem of tea do you really I guess what I'm trying to ask is there how difficult is
01:09:10 it to encode the cultural references the the context of the song the artists all those things together can machine
01:09:18 learning really not do that I mean I think machine learning is great at replicating patterns if you have the
01:09:25 patterns but if you try to write with me a spec of what songs greatest song testing in the card definition is is it
01:09:32 is it loud there's many choruses should've been in movies it's it quickly gets incredibly complicated right yeah
01:09:39 and and a lot of it may not be in the structure of the song or the title it could be cultural references because you
01:09:45 know it was a history once so so the definition problems quickly get and I think that was the that was the insight
01:09:52 of Andrew Aang when he said the job of the product manager is to understand these things that that algorithms don't
01:09:58 and then define what that looks like and then you have something to train towards right then you have kind of the test set
01:10:05 and then so so today the editors create this pool of tracks and then we personalize you could easily imagine
01:10:10 that once you have this set you could have some automatic exploration on the rest of the catalogue because then you
01:10:15 understand what it is and then the other side of it what machine learning does help is this taste vector how hard
01:10:23 is it to construct a vector that represents the things an individual human likes it this human preference so
01:10:34 you can you know music isn't like it's not like Amazon like things you usually buy music seems more amorphous like it's
01:10:43 this thing that's hard to specify like what what is what you know if you look at my playlist what is the music that I
01:10:51 love it's harder it seems to be much more difficult to specify concretely so how hard is it to a build the taste
01:10:58 vector it is very hard in the sense that you need a lot of data and I think what we found was that so it's not so it's
01:11:06 not a stationery problem most it changes over time and so we've gone through the journey of if you've done a lot of
01:11:16 computer vision obviously I've done a bunch of computer vision in my past and and we started kind of with the
01:11:23 handcrafted heuristics for you know this is kind of in the music this is this and if you consume this you probably like
01:11:29 this so we have we started there and we have some of that still then what was interesting about the playlist data was
01:11:35 that you could find these latent things that wouldn't necessarily even make sense to you that could could even
01:11:41 capture maybe cultural references because they Co occurred things that they wouldn't have appeared
01:11:48 mechanistically either in the content or so forth so I think that I think the core assumption is that there are
01:12:03 patterns in in almost everything and if there are patterns these these embedding techniques are getting better and better
01:12:10 now if now as everyone else we're also using kind of deep embedding so you can encode binary values and so forth and
01:12:18 what I think is interesting is is this process to try to find things that they do not necessarily you wouldn't actually
01:12:27 have have guessed so it is very hard in a in an engineering sense to find the dimensions it's an incredible
01:12:35 scalability problem to do for hundreds of millions of users and to update it every day but in but in theory in theory
01:12:44 embeddings isn't that complicated the fact that you try to find some principal components or some like that
01:12:50 dimensionality reduction is also the theory I guess is easy that the practices is very very hard and it's a
01:12:56 it's a huge engineering challenge but fortunately we have some amazing research and engineering teams in this
01:13:04 space yeah I guess the the question is all I mean it's similar I deal with it with an autonomous vehicle spaces the
01:13:12 question is how hard is driving and here is basically the question is of edge cases so embedding probably works not
01:13:25 probably but I would imagine works well in a lot of cases so there's a bunch of questions that arise then so do song
01:13:33 preferences does your taste vector depend on context like mood right so there's different moods and absolutely
01:13:46 so how does that take in is it is it possible to take that at consideration or do you just leave that as a interface
01:13:53 problem that allows the user to just control it so when I'm looking for workout music I kind of specify it by
01:13:59 choosing certain players doing certain search yeah so that's a great point it's back to the product development you
01:14:06 could try to spend a few years trying to predict which mood you're in automatically open Spotify or you create
01:14:13 a tab which is happy and sad right and you're gonna be right 100% of the time with one click now it's probably much
01:14:18 better to let the user tell you if they're happy or sad or if they want to work out on the other hand if you use
01:14:24 the interface become 2,000 tabs you're introducing so much friction so no one will use the product so then you have to
01:14:30 get better so it's this thing where I think it maybe was I remember who coined it but it's called fault tolerant you is
01:14:36 right you build the UI that is tolerant of being wrong and then you can be much less right in your you know in your algorithms
01:14:45 so we you know we've had to learn a lot of that building the right UI that fits where the where the machine learning is
01:14:53 and and a great discovery there which is which was by the teams during one of our hack days was this thing of taking
01:15:00 discovery packaging it into a playlist and saying that these are new tracks that we think you might like based on
01:15:07 this and studying the right expectation made it made it a great product so I think we have this benefit that for
01:15:15 example Tesla doesn't have that we can we can we can change the expectation we can we can build a fault-tolerant
01:15:19 setting it's very hard to be fault tolerant when you're driving at you know 100 miles per hour or something and and
01:15:26 we we have the luxury of being able to say that of being wrong if we have the right UI which gives us different
01:15:33 abilities to take more risk so I actually think the self-driving problem is is much harder oh yeah for sure
01:15:43 it's much less fun because people die exactly and in Spotify it's just such a more fun problem because failure will
01:15:55 mean failures beautiful away at least exploration so it's a really fun reinforcement learning project the worst
01:16:01 case scenario is to get these WTF tweets like how did I get this this song which is a lot better than the self-driving
01:16:09 favor so what's the feedback that a user puts the signal that a user provides into the system so the the you mentioned
01:16:20 skipping what is like the strongest signal is  you didn't mention clicking like so so we have a few signals that
01:16:29 are important obviously playing playing through so so one of the benefits of music actually even compared to podcast
01:16:37 or or movies is the object itself is really only about three minutes so you get a lot of chances to recommend and
01:16:43 the feedback loop is is every three minutes instead of every two hours or some things you actually get kind of
01:16:51 noisy but but quite fast feedback and so you can see if people played through or if they which is you know the inverse of
01:16:55 skip really that an important signal on the other hand much of the consumption happens when
01:17:00 your phone is in your pocket maybe you're running or driving or you're playing on a speaker and so you not
01:17:05 skipping doesn't mean that you love that song it might be that it wasn't bad enough that you would walk up and skip
01:17:11 so it's a noisy signal then then we have the equivalent of the like which is you saved it to your library that's a pretty
01:17:18 strong signal of affection and then we have the more explicit signal of play listing like you took the time to create
01:17:24 a playlist you put it in there there's a very little small chance that if you took all that trouble this is not a
01:17:30 really important track to you and then we understand also what are the tracks it relates to so we have we have the
01:17:36 playlist thing we have the like and then we have the listening or skipped and you have two very different approaches to
01:17:43 all of them because at different levels of noise one one is very voluminous but noisy and the others rare but you can
01:17:50 you can probably trust it yeah it's interesting I think between those signals captures all the information
01:17:57 you'd want to capture I mean there's a feeling a shallow feeling for me that there's sometimes I'll hear songs like
01:18:04 yes this is you know this was the right song for the moment but there's really no way to express that fact except by
01:18:11 listening through it all the way yeah and maybe playing it again at that time or something yeah
01:18:17 there's no need for a button that says this was the best song I could have heard at this moment well we're playing
01:18:23 around with that with kind of the thumbs up concept saying like I really like this just kind of talking to the
01:18:28 algorithm it's unclear if that's the best way for you miss to interact maybe it is maybe they should think of Spotify
01:18:35 has a person an agent sitting there trying to serve you and you can say like that's modified good Spotify right now
01:18:41 the analogy we've had is more you shouldn't think of us we should be invested oh and the feedback is if you
01:18:48 save it it's kind of you work for yourself you do a playlist because you think is great and we can learn from
01:18:53 that it's kind of back to back to Tesla how they kind of have that shadow mode they sit in what you drive we kind of
01:18:59 took the same analogy we stayed in watch your playlist and then maybe we can we can offer you an autopilot where you can
01:19:04 take over for a while or something like that and then back off if you say like that's not that's not good enough
01:19:09 but but I think it's interesting to figure out what your mental model s if Spotify is an AI that you talk to which
01:19:17 I think might be a bit too abstract for for many consumers or if you still think of it as it's my music app but it's just
01:19:25 more helpful and depends on the device it's running on which brings us to smart speakers so I have a lot of the Spotify
01:19:35 listening I do is on things like on device they can talk to you whether it's from Amazon Google or Apple what's the
01:19:43 role Spotify on those devices how do you think of it differently then on the phone or on the desktop there are few
01:19:51 things to say about the first of all it's incredibly exciting they're growing like crazy especially here in the in the
01:20:02 in the US and it's solving a consumer need that I think is is you can think of it as just remote interactivity you can
01:20:11 control this thing from from from across the room and it might may feel like a small thing but it turns out that
01:20:18 friction matters to consumers being able to say play pause and so forth from across the room is very powerful so
01:20:24 basically you made you made the living room interactive now and what we see in our data is that the the number one use
01:20:34 case for these speakers is music music and podcasts so fortunately for us it's been important to these companies to
01:20:42 have those use case covered so they wanted Spotify on this we have very good relationships with with them and we're
01:20:50 seeing we're seeing tremendous success for them what what I think it's interesting about them is it's already
01:20:59 working with we kind of had this epiphany many years ago back when we started using Sonos if you went through
01:21:06 all the trouble of setting up your sonar system you had this magical experience where you had all the music ever made in
01:21:13 your living room and and we we we made this assumption that the home everyone use that a CD player at home but they
01:21:19 never managed to get their files working in the home having this network attached which was too cumbersome for most
01:21:25 consumers so we made the assumption that the home would skip from the CD all the way to streaming books where where you
01:21:31 will get would by the steering without all the music built-in that took longer than we thought but with the voice
01:21:36 speakers that was the unlocking that made kind of the connected speaker happen in the home so so it really it
01:21:44 really exploded and we saw this engagement that we predicted would happen what I think is interesting
01:21:49 though is where it's going from now right now you think of them as voice speakers but I think if you look at
01:21:57 Google i/o for example they just added a camera to it where you know when the alarm goes off instead of saying hey
01:22:05 Google stop you can just wave your hand so I think they're gonna think more of it as a as an agent or as an assistant
01:22:14 truly an assistant and an assistant that can see you it's gonna be much more effective than then a blind assistant so
01:22:20 I think these things will morph and we won't necessarily think of them as quote-unquote voice speakers anymore
01:22:28 just as interactive access to the Internet in the home but I still think that the biggest use case for those will
01:22:36 be will be audio so for that reason we're investing heavily in it and we've built our own NLU stack to be able to
01:22:44 the the challenge here is how do you innovate in that well it's it's it lowers friction for consumers but it's
01:22:49 also much more constrained there you have no pixels to play with in an in an audio-only world it's really the
01:22:56 vocabulary that is the interface so we started investing and playing around quite a lot with that trying to
01:23:01 understand what the future will be of you speaking and gesturing and waving at your music and actually you're actually
01:23:08 nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle space because from everything I've seen the level of frustration people
01:23:15 experience upon failure of natural language understanding is much higher than failure in other content people get
01:23:22 frustrated really fast so if you screw screw that experience up even just a little bit they give up really quickly
01:23:29 yeah and I think you see that in the data while well it's tremendously successful the most common interactions are play pause
01:23:38 and you know next the things were if you compare it to taking up your phone unlocking you bringing up the app and
01:23:43 skipping clicking skip yeah it was it was much lower friction but then for for longer more complicated things like you
01:23:51 if I mean that song about people stopping up the phone and search and then play it on their speaker so we
01:23:55 tried again to build a fault-tolerant UI where for the more for the more complicated things you can still pick up
01:24:01 your phone have powerful full keyboard search and then try to optimize for whether it's actually lower friction and
01:24:08 try to it's it's kind of like the test autopilot thing you have to be at the level where you're helpful if you're too
01:24:14 smart and just in the way people are gonna get frustrated and first of all I'm not obsessed with stairway to heaven
01:24:20 it's just a good song but let me mention that as a use case because it's an interesting one I've literally told one
01:24:27 of I don't want to say the name of the speaker cuz though when people are listening to it'll make their speaker go
01:24:33 off but I talk to the speaker and I say play stairway to heaven and every time it like not every time but a large
01:24:41 percent of the time plays the wrong stairway to heaven it plays like some cover of the and that that part of the
01:24:50 experience I actually wonder from a business perspective the Spotify control that entire experience or no it seems
01:24:59 like the NLU the the natural language stuff is controlled by the speaker and then Spotify stays at a layer below that
01:25:07 it is a good and complicated question some of which is dependent on the on the partner so it's hard to comment on the
01:25:15 own specifics but the question is the right one the challenges if you can't use any other personalization I mean we
01:25:22 know which stairway to heaven and and the truth is maybe for for one person it is exactly the cover that they want and
01:25:29 they will be very frustrated if a place I I think we I think we default to the right version but but you actually want
01:25:34 to be able to do the cover for the person that just played the cover 50 times or Spotify is just gonna seem
01:25:40 stupid so you want to be able to leverage the personalization but you have this stack where where you have the
01:25:47 the ASR and this thing called the N best list so then that guesses here and then the presentation comes in
01:25:52 at the end you actually want the personalization to be here when you're guessing about what they actually meant
01:25:57 so we're working with these partners and it's a complicated it's a complicated thing where you want to you want to be
01:26:05 able so first of all you want to be very careful with you users data you don't share your users data without
01:26:10 the permission but you want to share some data so that their experience gets better so that these partners can understand
01:26:16 enough but not too much and so forth so it's really the trick is that it's like a business driven relationship where
01:26:23 you're doing product development across companies together yeah which is which is really complicated but this is
01:26:31 exactly why we built our own NLU so that we actually can make personalized guesses because this is the biggest
01:26:36 frustration from a user point of view they don't understand about ASRs and n best lists and and business deals
01:26:41 they're like how hard can it be I've told this thing 50 times in this version and still applies the wrong
01:26:47 thing it can't it can't be hard so we try to take the user approach if the user the users not going to understand
01:26:53 the complications of business we have to solve it let's talk about sort of a complicated subject that I myself I'm
01:27:11 paying artists right I saw as of August 31st 2018 over 11 billion dollars were paid to rights holders so and further
01:27:21 distributed to artists from Spotify so a lot of money is being paid to artists first of all the whole time is a
01:27:28 consumer for me when I look at Spotify I'm not sure I'm remembering correctly but I think you said exactly how I feel
01:27:35 which is this is too good to be true like when I started using Spotify I assume you guys will go bankrupt in like
01:27:44 a month it's like this is too good a lot of people did like this is amazing so one question I have is sort of the
01:27:54 bigger question how do you make money in this complicated world how do you deal with a relationship with record labels who
01:28:07 are complicated these big you're essentially and have the task of herding cats but like rich and powerful cats and also
01:28:19 have the task of paying artists enough and paying those labels enough and still making money in the internet space or
01:28:26 people are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars a month so how do you navigate the space how do you know
01:28:33 that's a beautiful description hurting rich cats yeah that's before it is very complicated and I think certainly
01:28:42 actually betting against Porter fire has been statistically a very smart thing to do just looking at the at the line of
01:28:50 roadkill in music streaming services it's it's kind of I think if I had understood the complexity when I joined
01:28:58 Spotify unfortunately fortunately I didn't know enough about the music industry to understand the complexities
01:29:04 because then I would have made a more rational guess that it wouldn't work so you know ignorant is bliss but I think
01:29:13 there have been a few distinct challenges I think as I said one of the things that made it work at all was that
01:29:20 Sweden and the Nordic was a lost market so there was you know there was there was no risk for labels to try this I
01:29:27 don't think it would have worked if if the market was was healthy so so that was the initial condition then then we
01:29:36 had this tremendous challenge with the model itself so now most people were pirating but for the people who bought a
01:29:45 download or CD the artists will get all the revenue for all the future plays then right so you got it all up front
01:29:51 whereas the streaming model was like almost nothing they want almost nothing they - and then at some point this curve
01:29:58 of incremental revenue would intersect with your day one payment and that took a long time to play out before before
01:30:06 the music labels they understood that but on the other side it took a lot of time to understand that actually if I
01:30:11 have a big hit that is gonna be played for for many years this is a much better model because I get paid based on how much
01:30:18 people use the product not how much they thought they would use it day one or so forth so it was a complicated model to
01:30:24 get across and but time helped with that right and now now the revenues to the music industry actually are bigger again
01:30:31 then you know it's gone through this incredible dip and now they're back up and so we're we're very really proud of
01:30:39 having having been a part of that so there have been distinct problems I think when it comes to the to the labels
01:30:48 we have taken the painful approach some of our competition at the time they kind of they kind of look that other
01:30:54 companies instead if we just if we just ignore the rights and we get really big really fast we're gonna be too big for
01:31:01 the the labels too kind of too big to fail they're not gonna kill us we didn't take that approach we went legal from
01:31:07 day one and we we negotiated and negotiated and negotiated was very slow is very frustrating we were angry at
01:31:12 seeing other companies taking shortcuts and seeming to get away with it it was this this this game theory thing where
01:31:19 over many rounds of playing the game this would be the right strategy and even though to clearly there's a lot of
01:31:26 frustrations at times during negotiations there is this there is this weird trust where we have been honest
01:31:34 and fair we never screw them the inner screwed us it's ten years but there's this trust in like they know that if
01:31:42 music doesn't get really big if lots of people do not want to listen to music I want to pay for it
01:31:47 Spotify has no business model so we actually are incredibly aligned right other companies not to be tense but
01:31:53 other companies have other business models where even if they may know music from no money from music they still be
01:31:59 profitable companies but fall if I want so and I think the industry sees that we are actually aligned business-wise so
01:32:08 there is this distrust that allows us to to do product development even if it's scary you know taking risks the free
01:32:17 model itself was an incredible risk for the music industry to take that they should get credit for now some of it was
01:32:22 that they had nothing to lose in Sweden but frankly a lot of the labels also took risk and so I think we built up
01:32:27 that trust with a I think hurting what cats sounds a bit what's the word it sounds like I'm
01:32:36 dismissive of the guests dismissive no everyday yeah you matter they're all beautiful and and very important exactly
01:32:41 they've taken a lot of risks and certainly it's been frustrating about it yeah it's it's it's really like playing
01:32:49 its its game theory if you play that if you play the game many times and then you can have this statistical outcome
01:32:55 that you bet on and it feels very painful when you're in the middle of that thing I mean there's risk this
01:33:01 trust there's relationships from just having read the biography of Steve Jobs similar kind of relationship were
01:33:09 discussed in iTunes the idea of selling a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable for labels and exactly and
01:33:16 there was no it was the same kind of thing it was trust it was game theory as is a lot of our relationships that had
01:33:23 to be built and it's really a terrifyingly difficult process that Apple could go through a little bit
01:33:31 because they could afford for that process to fail for Spotify it seems terrifying because you can't initially I
01:33:40 think a lot of it comes out comes down to honestly Daniel and his tenacity in in negotiating which seems like an
01:33:49 impossible this is a fun task because he was completely unknown and so forth but maybe that was also the reason that that
01:33:55 it worked but I think yeah I think game theory is probably the best way to think about it
01:34:04 you could straight go straight for this like Nash equilibrium that someone is going to defect or or you played many
01:34:11 times you try to actually go for the top left the corporation cell is there any magical reason why Spotify seems to have
01:34:21 won this so a lot of people have tried to do a spot if I try to do and Spotify has come out well so the order is that
01:34:28 there's no magical reason because I I don't believe in magic but I think there are there are reasons and I think some
01:34:37 of them are that people have misunderstood a lot of what we actually do the actual the actual Spotify model
01:34:45 is very complicated they've looked at the premium model and said it seems like you can you can charge $9.99 for music
01:34:52 and people are gonna pay but that's not what happened actually when we launched the original mobile product everyone
01:34:58 said they would never pay what happened was they started on the on the free product and then their engagement grew
01:35:04 so much that eventually they said maybe it is worth $9.99 right it's it's your propensity to pay grows with your
01:35:10 engagement so we had this super complicated business model we operate two different business model advertising
01:35:17 and premium at the same time and I think that is hard to replicate however I struggled to think of other companies
01:35:23 that run large-scale advertising and subscription products at the same time so I think the business model is
01:35:28 actually much more complicated than people think it is and and so some people went after just the premium part
01:35:34 without the free part and ran into a wall where no one wanted to pay some people went after just music music
01:35:42 should be free just ads which doesn't give you enough revenue and doesn't work for the music industry so I think that
01:35:47 combination is kind of a pick from the outside so maybe I shouldn't say it here and reveal the secret but that that
01:35:54 turns out to be hard to replicate then you with then you would think so there's a lot of brilliant business strategy
01:36:01 here brilliance or luck probably more luck but it doesn't really matter it looks brilliant
01:36:07 in retrospect let's call it brilliant yeah when the books are read no brilliant you've mentioned that your
01:36:17 philosophy is to embrace change so how will the music streaming and music listening world change over the next 10
01:36:25 years 20 years you look out into the far future what do you think I think that music and for that matter
01:36:35 audio podcasts audiobooks I think it's one of the few core human needs I think it there is no good reason to me why it
01:36:41 shouldn't be at the scale of something like messaging or social networking I don't think it's a nice thing to listen
01:36:48 to music or news or something so I think scale is obviously one of the things that I really hope for I think I hope
01:36:54 that it's going to be billions of users I hope eventually everyone in the world gets access to all the world's music
01:37:00 ever made so obviously I think it's going to be a much bigger business otherwise we we wouldn't be betting this
01:37:07 big now if you if you look more at how it is consumed what I'm hoping is back to this analogy of the software tool
01:37:18 chain where I think I sometimes internally I make this analogy to to text messaging text messaging was also
01:37:28 based on standards in the in the area of mobile carriers you had the SMS the 140 character 2020 carrot SMS and it was
01:37:36 great because everyone agreed on the standard so as a consumer you got a lot of distributions and interoperability
01:37:42 but it was a very constrained format and and when the industry wanted to add pictures to that format to do the MMS I
01:37:48 looked it up and I think it took from the late 80s to early 2000 this is like a 15 20 year product cycle to bring
01:37:56 pictures into that now once that entire value chain of creation and consumption got wrapped in one software stack with
01:38:03 in something like snapchat or whatsapp like the first week they had a disappearing messages like then two
01:38:09 weeks later they added stories like the pace of innovation when you're on one software stack and you can you can you
01:38:15 can affect both creation and consumption I think is going to be rapid so with these streaming services we now for the
01:38:22 first time in history have enough I hope people on one of these services actually whether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple
01:38:29 or or YouTube and hopefully enough creators that you can actually start working with a format again and and that
01:38:34 excites me I think being able to change these constraints from a hundred years that could really that could really do
01:38:40 something interesting I don't I really hope it's not just going to be their iteration on on the same thing for the
01:38:46 next ten to twenty years as well yeah changing the creation of music equation of audio equation of podcast is
01:38:54 a really fascinating possibility I myself don't understand what it is about podcast that's so intimate it just is I
01:39:03 listen to a lot of podcasts I think it touches on a human and a deep human need for connection that people do feel like
01:39:13 they're connected to when they listen I don't understand what the psychology that is but in this world that's
01:39:20 becoming more and more disconnected it feels like this is fulfilling a certain kind of need and empowering the creator
01:39:29 as opposed to just the listener it's really interesting so this is I'm really excited that you're working on it yeah I
01:39:35 think one of the things that is inspiring for our teams to work on podcast is exactly that what do you
01:39:41 think like I like I probably do that it's something biological about perceiving to be in the middle of the
01:39:47 conversation that makes you listen in a different way it doesn't really matter people seem to perceive it differently
01:39:52 and there was this narrative for a long time that you know if you look at video everything kind of in the foreground I
01:39:57 got shorter and shorter and shorter because of financial pressure is a monetization and so forth an event at
01:40:04 the end there zones like 20 seconds clipped people just screaming something and I'm really I feel really good about
01:40:14 the fact that you you could have interpreted that as people have no attention span anymore they don't want
01:40:18 to listen to things they're not interested in deeper stories like you know people are people are getting dumber
01:40:24 but then podcast came along and it's almost like no no they need still existed once what but maybe maybe it was
01:40:31 the fact that you're not prepared to look at your phone like this for two hours but if you can drive at the same
01:40:36 time it seems like people really want to dig and they want to hear like the more complicated version so to me that is
01:40:42 very inspiring that that podcast is actually long-form it gives me a lot of hope for for Humanity that people seem
01:40:49 really interested in hearing deeper more complicated this is a I don't understand it it's fascinating so the majority for
01:40:58 this podcast listen to the whole thing this whole conversation we've been talking for an hour and 45 minutes and
01:41:05 somebody will I mean most people will be listening to these words I'm speaking right now they wouldn't have thought
01:41:10 that 10 years ago with what the world seemed to go that's very positive I think that's really exciting and
01:41:16 empowering the creator and there's really exciting last question you also have a passion for just mobile in
01:41:26 general how do you see the smartphone world this the the digital space of of smartphones and just everything that's
01:41:37 on the move whether it's Internet of Things and so on changing over the next 10 years and so on I think that one way
01:41:46 to think about it is that computing might be moving out of these multi-purpose devices the computer we
01:41:55 had in the phone into specific specific specific purpose devices and you know it will be ambient that you know at least
01:42:03 in my home you just shout something at someone and there's always like one of these speakers close enough and so you
01:42:09 start behaving differently it's as if you have the Internet ambient ambiently around you and you can
01:42:19 so I think computing or kind of get more integrated and we won we won't necessarily think of that as as
01:42:25 connected to a device and the same thing in the same way that we do today I don't know the path to that maybe we used to
01:42:33 have these desktop computers and then we partially replace that with the with the laptops and left you know at home and at
01:42:40 work and then we got these phones and we started leaving the laptop at home for a while and maybe the maybe for stretches
01:42:46 of time you're gonna start using the watch and you can leave your your phone at home like for a run or something and
01:42:52 you know we're on this progressive path where you I think what what is happening with the voice is that you haven't you
01:43:02 have an interactive interaction paradigm that doesn't require as large physical devices so I definitely think there's a
01:43:10 future where you can have your your airports and and your watch and you can do a lot of computing and I don't think
01:43:20 it's gonna be this binary thing I think it's gonna be like many of us still have a laptop we just use it less and so you
01:43:27 shift your your consumption over and I don't know about a or glasses and so forth I'm excited about I spend a lot
01:43:34 of time in that area but I still think it's quite far away they are VR oh yes VR is is happening and working I think
01:43:43 the recent oculus quest is quite impressive I think AR is further away at least that type of AR I think but I do
01:43:52 think your phone or water glasses understanding where you are and maybe what you're looking at and being able to
01:43:57 give you all your cues about or you can say like what is this and it tells you what it is that I think might happen you
01:44:04 you know you use your your watch to your glasses there's a as a mouse pointer on reality I think it might be a while
01:44:10 before I might be wrong I hope I'm wrong I think it might be a while before we walk around with these big like lab
01:44:16 glasses then project things I agree with you there's a it's actually really difficult when you have to understand
01:44:23 the physical world enough to project onto it well I lied about the last question because I just thought of audio and my
01:44:33 favorite topic which is the movie her mm-hmm do you think well there's part of Spotify or not will have I don't know if
01:44:46 you've seen the movie her absolutely and their audio is the primary form of interaction and the connection with
01:44:55 another entity that you can actually have a relationship with actually fall in love with based on voice alone audio
01:45:02 alone you how far do you think that's possible first of all based on audio alone to fall in love with somebody
01:45:07 somebody or well yeah let's go with somebody just have a relationship based on audio alone and second question to
01:45:14 that can we create an artificial intelligence system that allows one to fall in love with it and hurt him with
01:45:24 you so there's my personal personal answer speaking for me as a person the answer is quite unequivocally yes on
01:45:33 both I think what we just said about podcasts and the feeling of being in the middle of a conversation if you could
01:45:42 have an assistant where and we just said that feels like a very personal settings so if you walk around with these
01:45:46 headphones and this thing you're speaking with this thing all of the time that feels like it's in your brain I
01:45:53 think it's it's gonna be much easier to fall in love with than something that would be on your screen I think that's
01:45:58 entirely possible and then from that you can programs is better than me but from the concept of if it's going to be
01:46:06 possible to build a machine that they can achieve that I think whether you whether you think of it as if you can
01:46:12 fake it the philosophical zombie that it simulates it enough or it it somehow actually is I think there's it's only
01:46:19 question if you ask me about time I'd had to be a financier but if you say a given some half infinite time absolutely
01:46:27 I think it's just atoms and arrangement of information well I personally think that love is a lot simpler than people
01:46:35 think so we started with true romance and ended in love I don't see a better place to end beautiful Gustav thanks so
