00:00:16 and a gas-powered car sought to win a heated race one that mimicked how cars are actually used
00:00:23 the cars had to stop at stop lights wait for pedestrians to cross the street and swerve in and out of the hundreds of
00:00:28 horse-drawn buggies that's right horse-drawn buggies because this race took place in 1908
00:00:35 it wanted to settle once and for all which car was the superior urban vehicle although the gas power car was
00:00:40 more powerful the electric car was more versatile and as the cars passed over the finish line
00:00:45 the defeat was stunning the 1908 studebaker electric car
00:00:53 won by 10 minutes so if in 1908 the electric car was clearly the better form of
00:00:58 transportation why don't we drive them now today i'm going to answer that question by diving into the history of
00:01:04 electric cars and what i discovered may surprise you in 1881 at a blistering pace of nine
00:01:16 miles per hour inventor gustav truvay introduced the streets of paris
00:01:21 and ultimately the world to the quiet hum of the electric carriage for the wealthy socialites of
00:01:27 paris and their counterparts in new york the horseless carriage was a must-have and electric motors were the
00:01:33 superior choice by 1900 there were 4 1992 vehicles on the streets of the us
00:01:42 steam cars accounted for 1681 of these vehicles 1575 were electric and 936 had internal combustion engines
00:01:51 if you just wanted to get around town the electric carriage was the better option that is
00:01:56 if you were rich enough to afford one unlike internal combustion engines electric vehicles were easy to turn on accelerate
00:02:03 brake there was no exhaust and you didn't have something constantly exploding under your seat oh and you also didn't
00:02:09 have to crank the engine every time you stopped which is part of the reason why the electric studebaker
00:02:15 won that philadelphia race so handily as a result of this ease of use electric cars were looking like big
00:02:21 business in the early 1900s especially for the industry giant electric vehicle company
00:02:26 at the time the electric vehicle company was the biggest car manufacturer in the country and they used a model
00:02:33 that seems revolutionary now but makes sense back then instead of selling their cars they rented them out
00:02:38 to people for the day or for multiple days each night the renter could return the car to a central garage
00:02:45 and the electric vehicle company would charge and service the vehicle a model very similar to how stables
00:02:50 worked at the time but despite the electric car's success its golden age
00:02:57 was about to end first an investigation by the new york herald accused the electric vehicle
00:03:03 company of fraudulently securing alone leading to intense backlash that ultimately bankrupted the
00:03:09 company in 1901 then henry ford started banging out gas-powered vehicles and with the help
00:03:13 of scale exploitation of his workers and the invention of the electric starter in
00:03:20 1912 which meant that drivers no longer had to crank their cars every time they wanted to travel people
00:03:25 started paying attention to the internal combustion engine around that same time roads were
00:03:30 beginning to be paved but these roads took people out into the country which lacked charging ports
00:03:35 so the range of electric vehicles became more of an issue local and federal governments failed to
00:03:41 build the needed infrastructure for electric vehicles which meant that gas-powered vehicles
00:03:45 were a much better option for the growing hordes hoping to escape the city and finally as the auto
00:03:52 industry began to attract more customers in the early 1900s advertising became increasingly gendered
00:03:58 electric vehicles more often than not were sold to women as easy to drive parlors on wheels even henry ford's wife
00:04:07 owned an electric vehicle gas-powered cars on the other hand were painted as dirty greasy powerful and masculine cars that could
00:04:14 take you out to the country and then let you speed through the streets so white men aka those that had
00:04:21 both money and power in early 20th century america aka the primary buyers of cars tended to purchase
00:04:29 gas-powered vehicles and so by the 1920s the perfectly serviceable electric car was all but extinct
00:04:36 these cars failed not because they were inferior vehicles they failed because cultural and societal pressures
00:04:42 steered us into the driver's seat of gas guzzlers the electric car is here the ev-1 a revolution in the car
00:04:56 industry with california's announcement of a zero emissions car mandate general motors scrambled to make an
00:05:03 electric car their answer was the 1996 ev1 a futuristic car for the 90s that could reach 80 miles per hour on the highway
00:05:11 and had a range of 70 to 100 miles all on an electric battery the electric car was back tom hanks
00:05:17 grabbed one and loved it that sucker goes that they will take you down the pch so fast you
00:05:23 could get a ticket and so did danny devito plug it in at night that's all you did
00:05:29 nothing no repairs no nothing but gm wasn't just making this car because they cared about the environment
00:05:34 or electric cars for that matter they made the ev1 because they had to the california air
00:05:40 resources board required the top seven auto manufacturers to make two percent of its fleet emissions free by
00:05:47 1998 5 by 2001 and 10 of its fleet emissions free by 2003. so car manufacturers
00:05:54 like gm initially complied they retrofitted their models with electric motors and sold them throughout california in
00:06:01 the beginning it seemed like the auto industry was going to make a momentous change that is until people started
00:06:07 looking under the hood while gm was leasing their ev1s to the likes of tom hanks they were also
00:06:13 mounting lobbying advertising and astroturfing campaigns to dismantle the zero emissions mandate
00:06:21 why you may ask well consumer advocate ralph nader seems to think it's pretty simple the
00:06:25 executives at the top their motto seem to have been going backwards into the future
00:06:31 despite consumer demand and large waitlists for the ev1 gm actively sought to dismantle ev production
00:06:38 because it was inconvenient for them keep in mind this was around the same time when they started selling
00:06:45 suvs and hummers on mass so they not only successfully got the california air resources board to repeal the mandate
00:06:50 but afterwards gm rounded up every single ev1 they had leased out
00:06:57 took them to a junkyard and crushed them that's right the company that just ran this super bowl ad did you know that
00:07:03 norway sells way more electric cars per capita than the us norway had a successful electric vehicle
00:07:11 program in the early 2000s and they purposefully tanked it because they wanted to sell more suvs
00:07:24 are things different now in 2021 or will we just repeat the same mistakes of history if tesla's and other electric
00:07:31 vehicles trajectory or any indicator evs might be here to stay if and how quickly they replace gas-powered cars
00:07:39 seems to be up to strong government policy policy which up until november 23 2020 gm was
00:07:46 ruthlessly opposing their flip-flopping might just have something to do with the fact that trump
00:07:51 is no longer in the white house in fact throughout trump's presidency the auto industry fought tooth and nail
00:07:57 to prevent any sort of emissions standards in march of 2020 trump with the support of auto industry giants rolled back a
00:08:05 landmark obama-era emissions mandate the rollback would have led to nearly a billion additional metric tons
00:08:10 of co2 in the atmosphere if not for biden's reinstatement of the order much like california's zero
00:08:17 emissions mandate in the early 2000s gm was right there on the ground lobbying for that rollback to happen
00:08:24 the national auto dealers association which gm works closely with has spent over 57 million dollars
00:08:31 lobbying congress since 1998. the reality is that emissions mandates and electric car subsidies
00:08:38 do work but while great for us for the auto industry it forces them to do away with their going backward into the
00:08:43 future mindset but it is possible to rapidly ramp up electric vehicle use
00:08:50 norway is a perfect example in 2012 three percent of the country's new cars were electric
00:08:56 just seven years later that number is up to 56 percent what norway did is quite simple they
00:09:02 subsidized evs heavily to the point where they were cheaper than their gas-powered counterparts
00:09:06 and they built a lot of charging infrastructure to support these new cars it does seem like us is starting to
00:09:13 follow suit with california's governor issuing an executive order banning gas-powered car sales by 2035
00:09:20 and gm saying that by that same year it will only sell electric cars while this is hopeful news
00:09:26 considering the history of the auto industry which by the way raleigh from the youtube channel climatetown did a
00:09:32 video all about the auto industry over at his channel it's hard to fully embrace these announcements without
00:09:42 as we move closer and closer to 2050 the year when the world must be at zero missions to avoid the
00:09:47 worst climate change scenarios i think it's important to take a step back and consider whether switching to
00:09:52 electric cars is the best solution no i don't mean we should stick with the
00:09:58 internal combustion engine what i'm saying is we should be trying to replace our current cars with electric models
00:10:06 while also envisioning a world with less cars because to be honest cars suck the co-founder of zipcar robin chase
00:10:13 describes the failed promise of cars perfectly in a documentary on curiosity stream we were promised you know that
00:10:18 cars brought independence but we all know that most of us are driving is in very dense traffic
00:10:24 it's not a pleasure it's very expensive and time-consuming even electric cars have an impact both in
00:10:29 terms of emissions and the green colonialism and exploitation that accompanies corporate desires
00:10:36 for metals like lithium so when we begin to support new infrastructure for charging systems we also need to
00:10:43 consider how to build cities and towns that no longer center cars as a resident's primary mode of
00:10:49 transportation and make walking biking and using public transit really easy really pleasurable
00:10:55 and really cheap or free the key question here should be how can we connect countries states
00:11:02 cities and towns through affordable and clean public transportation without cars yes the electric car will
00:11:08 have some role to play in this new transportation system but it should be seen as a piece of the
00:11:14 puzzle rather than the essential tool that unlocks travel creating this alternative transportation
00:11:19 system will certainly be difficult but not only is it possible through militant community organizing
00:11:26 and consistent public pressure on corporations politicians and governments it is also an essential part of a more ethical
00:11:37 and just zero-emissions world after being on youtube for over four years i still find it really hard to
00:11:43 create climate-oriented videos that perform well the truth is that the algorithm tends not to like politically charged
00:11:48 videos like the one i just made about eco-socialism and bolivia and videos like those end up
00:11:55 doing poorly or even getting demonetized which is why a bunch of creator friends and i teamed up to create a platform
00:12:01 where we can make content without having to worry about pleasing the youtube algorithm it's called nebula and we're thrilled to
