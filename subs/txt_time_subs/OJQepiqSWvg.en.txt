00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Paul Krugman Nobel Prize winner in economics professor CUNY and columnist
00:00:09 at the New York Times his academic work centers around International Economics economic geography liquidity traps and
00:00:17 currency crises but he also is an outspoken writer and commentator on the intersection of modern-day politics and
00:00:25 economics which places him in the middle of the tense divisive modern-day political discourse if you have clicked
00:00:32 dislike on this video and started writing a comment of derision before listening to the conversation I humbly
00:00:39 ask that you please unsubscribe from this channel and from this podcast not because you're conservative a
00:00:45 libertarian the liberal or socialist and anarchist but because you're not open to new ideas at least in this case especially and
00:00:53 it's most difficult from people with whom you'll largely disagree I do my best to stay away from politics of the
00:01:00 day because political discourse is filled with a degree of emotion and self assured certainty that to me is not
00:01:08 conducive to exploring questions that nobody knows the definitive right answer to the role of government the impact of
00:01:17 automation the regulation of tech the medical system guns war trade foreign policy are not easy topics I have no
00:01:24 clear answers despite the certainty of the so-called experts the pundits the trolls the media
00:01:32 personalities and the conspiracy theorists please listen empathize and allow yourself to explore
00:01:40 ideas with curiosity and without judgment and without derision I will speak with many more economists and
00:01:47 political thinkers trying to stay away from the political battles of the day and instead look at the long arc of
00:01:55 history and lessons it reveals in this I appreciate your patience and support this is the artificial intelligence

00:02:19 of the introduction I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle that can
00:02:25 break the flow of the conversation I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience this show is
00:02:33 presented by cash app the number one finance app in the App Store cash app lets you send money to friends by big
00:02:40 coin and invest in the stock market was fractional share trading allowing you to buy $1 worth of a stock no matter what
00:02:47 the stock price is brokerage services that provided by cash app investing a subsidiary of square and member si PC
00:02:54 get cash app from the App Store and Google Play and use the code Lex podcast you'll get ten dollars in cash Apple
00:03:02 also donate ten dollars to the first one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and stem
00:03:09 education for young people around the world since cash app does fractional share trading let me say that to me it's
00:03:17 a fascinating concept the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of
00:03:23 fractional orders for the investor is an algorithmic marvel so big props to the cash app engineers for that I like it
00:03:30 when tech teams solve complicated problems to provide in the end a simple effortless interface that abstract away
00:03:37 all the details of the underlying algorithm and now here's my conversation with Paul Krugman what does a perfect world a
00:03:47 utopia from an economics perspective look like Wow I don't really I don't believe in perfection I mean somebody
00:03:58 once once said that his ideal was slightly imaginary Sweden it I mean I like an economy that has a a really high
00:04:09 safety net for people a good environmental regulation and you know not something that's not that's kind of
00:04:17 like some of the better run countries in the world but with fixing all of the the smaller things that are wrong with them
00:04:25 what about wealth distribution well obviously you know total equality is is neither possible nor I think especially
00:04:32 desirable but I think you want one where basically one where nobody is nobody's hurting and where everybody lives in the
00:04:42 same material universe everybody is basically living in the same society so no I think it's a bad thing to have
00:04:48 people who are so wealthy that they're really not in the same world as the rest of us what about competition you see the
00:04:56 value of competition when what may be its limits Oh competition is great when it can work I
00:05:02 mean that there's a UH  you know I remember I'm old enough to remember when there was only one phone company and
00:05:09 there was really limited choice and I think the arrival of multiple multiple phone carriers and all that has actually
00:05:17 he has been up been a really good thing and that's that's true across many areas but not every industry is not every
00:05:26 activity is suitable for competition so there are some things like health care where competition actually doesn't work
00:05:34 and so it's it's it there's it's not one size fits all it's interesting what is competition now work in in health care
00:05:43 oh there's a long list I mean there's a famous paper by Kenneth arrow for 1963 which still holds up very well where he
00:05:49 kind of runs down the list of things you need for competition to work well basically both sides to every transaction being
00:05:57 well-informed having a you know the ability to make intelligent decisions understanding what's going on and
00:06:06 healthcare fails on every dimension you know you did health care so not health insurance health care well both health
00:06:10 care and health insurance health insurance being part of it but no health insurance is is it is really the idea
00:06:17 that there's effective competition between health insurers is wrong in health care I mean the idea that you can
00:06:24 comparison shop for for major surgery is is just you know it it - when people say things like that
00:06:31 you you wonder are you living in the same world I'm living in you know that the piece of well-informed that was
00:06:38 always an interesting piece for me just observing as an outsider because so much beautiful such a beautiful world as
00:06:47 possible and everybody's well informed a question for you is how hard is it to be well-informed about anything whether
00:06:53 it's health care or any kind of purchasing decisions or just life in general in this world oh information you
00:07:01 know in theory is hugely I mean there's more information at your fingertips than ever before in history
00:07:10 the trouble is first of all that some of that information isn't true so it's really hard and and then some of it's
00:07:18 just too hard to understand so if I'm if I'm buying a car I can actually probably do a pretty good job of looking up you
00:07:26 know going to consumer reports reviews you can get a pretty good idea of what you're getting when you get a car if I'm
00:07:36 going in for surgery first of all it's you know you think fairly often that happens when without your be able being
00:07:43 able to plan it but also there's a reit you know medical school takes many many years and going on the internet for some
00:07:49 advice is not usually a very good substitute so speaking about news and not being able to trust certain sources
00:07:57 of information how much disagreement is there about I mention utopia perfection in the
00:08:03 beginning but how much disagreement is there about what utopia looks like or as most of the disagreements simply
00:08:13 about the path to get there oh I think there's two levels of disagreement one maybe not utopia but justice you know
00:08:23 what is a just society and that's there are different views I mean I teach my students that there are you know too
00:08:29 broadly speaking two views of justice one focuses on on outcomes you ask your it's a just society is the one you would
00:08:42 choose if you were trying to what the one that you would choose to live in if you didn't know who you were going to be
00:08:48 that's kind of John Rawls and the other focuses on process that just society is one in which there is no no coercion
00:08:57 except we're absolutely necessary and there's no there's no objective way to choose between those I'm pretty much a
00:09:04 Rawls in and I think many people are okay with it there's so there's a legitimate dispute about what what we
00:09:12 mean by a just society anyway but then there's also a lot of disputes about what actually works there there's a
00:09:22 range of legitimate dispute I mean any card-carrying economist will say that incentives matter but how much do they
00:09:29 matter how much does a higher tax rate actually deter people from working how much does a a stronger safety net
00:09:39 actually lead people to to to get lazy I I have a pretty strong view that the evidence is points to a conclusions that
00:09:48 are considerably to the left of where most of our politicians are but but that there is legitimate room for
00:09:58 disagreement on those things so you've mentioned outcomes what are some metrics you think about the keep in mind like
00:10:05 the Gini coefficient but really anything that measures how good we're doing whatever we're trying to do well what
00:10:12 are the metrics to keep an eye on well I'm actually I'm not a fan of the Gini coefficient not because what is the Gini
00:10:19 coefficient okay the Gini coefficient is measure of inequality and it is commonly used because it's a single number
00:10:28 it usually tracks with other measures but the trouble is there's no sort of natural interpretation of it you ask me
00:10:38 what you know what what does a society with the genie of 0.45 look like as opposed to society with a genie of 0.25
00:10:46 and well I can kind of tell you you know when the 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is Brazil but it's that's a really there's
00:10:56 no sort of easy way to do that mapping I mean I I look at things like what is first of all things like what is the
00:11:08 income of the the the median family what is the income of the top 1% how many people are in poverty by various
00:11:15 measures of poverty and then I think we want to look at questions like how healthy are people how how is life
00:11:29 expectancy doing and how satisfied are people with their lives because there is it's that they has sounds like a squishy
00:11:35 number not so much happiness it turns out that life satisfaction is a better measure than the happiness but life
00:11:41 satisfaction that varies quite a lot and I think it I think it's meaningful if not too rigorous to say look according
00:11:51 to that kind of according to polling people in Denmark are pretty satisfied with their lives and people in the
00:11:59 United States not so much so and of course Sweden wins every time no actually Denmark wins these ends
00:12:05 Denmark and Norway tend to win these days Sweden doesn't do badly but they're there they're it's none of these are
00:12:16 perfect but look I think by and large I there's a bit of a pornography test if you how do you know a decent Society
00:12:23 well you kind of know it when you see it right where is America Stan and that we are have a remark our society I mean
00:12:33 it's there are a lot of virtues to America but there's a level of harshness brutality an ability
00:12:41 for somebody who just has bad luck to fall off the edge that is really shouldn't be happening in a country as
00:12:49 rich as ours so we we we have somehow managed to produce a crueler society than almost
00:12:59 any other wealthy country for no good reason what do you think is lacking in the safety net that the United States
00:13:04 provides you said it's there's a harshness to it and what what are the benefits and maybe limits of a safety
00:13:14 net in a country like ours well every other advanced country has some universal guarantee of adequate health
00:13:20 care the only in the United States it's the only place where citizens can actually fail to get basic health care
00:13:28 because they can't afford it that's that's that's we it's not hard to do everybody else does but we don't we've
00:13:34 gotten a little bit better at it than we were but still that's that's a big deal we have remarkably weak support for for
00:13:47 children we most countries have substantial safety you know parents of young children get much more support
00:13:55 elsewhere they get often nothing in the US we have limited care for people long-term care for for the elderly is a
00:14:07 very hiddenness thing but I think that the really big issues are that we don't take care of children who make the
00:14:17 mistake of having the wrong parents and we don't take care of people who make the mistake of getting sick and those
00:14:24 are those are things that a country a rich country should be doing sorry for a sort of a difficult question but what
00:14:31 you just said kind of feels like the right thing to do in terms of just society but is it also good for the
00:14:40 economic health of society to take care of to care the people who would the unfortunate members of society by and
00:14:47 large it looks like the doing the right thing in terms of justice is also the right thing
00:14:55 in terms of economics if we're talking about a society that has extremely high tax rates that deter you know remove all
00:15:04 incentives to provide a safety net that is so generous that why bother working or striving that could be a problem but
00:15:13 that's that I don't actually know any society that looks like that even even in European country with very generous
00:15:21 safety nets people work and and can innovate and do all of these things and there's a lot of evidence now that
00:15:29 lacking those basics is actually destructive that children who grow up without adequate health care without
00:15:37 adequate nutrition are developmentally challenged they don't live up to their potential as adults so that the United
00:15:43 States actually probably pays a price you know we're we're we're harsh we're cruel and we actually make ourselves
00:15:51 poor everybody as a society not just the individuals by being so harsh and cruel okay so invisible hand Smith where does
00:15:59 that fit in the power of just people acting selfishly and somehow everything taking care of itself
00:16:09 to where you know the economy grows nobody there's no cruelty no injustice that the markets themselves what is is
00:16:19 their power to that idea where what are its limits there's a lot of power to that I mean there there's a reason why I
00:16:27 don't think sensible people want the government running steel mills or they want the government
00:16:37 to own the farms right the the markets incentives aligned of inducing people to do stuff that works and the invisible
00:16:47 hand is saying that you know people farmers aren't growing crops because they want to feed people they're growing
00:16:54 crops because they can make money but it actually turns out they're a pretty good way of getting of getting
00:17:01 and agricultural products grown so the invisible hand is important part but it's not there's nothing mystical about
00:17:09 it it's a it's a mechanism it's a way to organize economic activity which works well given a bunch of preconditions
00:17:16 which means that it actually works well for agriculture it works well for manufacturing works well for many
00:17:24 services it doesn't work well for healthcare it doesn't work well for education so there are yeah we having a
00:17:33 society which is kind of 3/4 invisible hand and one-quarter visible hand seems to be something something on that order
00:17:41 seems to be the balance that works best it's just don't want to you don't want to romanticize or missed it you know
00:17:48 make it something mystical out of it it's just this is is one way to organize stuff that happens to have what broad
00:17:56 but not universal application so then forgive me for romanticizing it but it does seem pretty magical that you you
00:18:03 know that I kind of have an intuitive understanding of what happens when you have like 5 10 maybe even 100 people
00:18:09 together the dynamics of that but the fact that these large society of people for the most part acting in a
00:18:15 self-interested way and maybe electing representatives for themselves that it all kind of seems to work he's pretty
00:18:23 magical the fact that there's  you know that right now there's a wide assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables
00:18:35 in the you know in in at the in the local markets up and down the street you know who's who's planning that and the
00:18:42 answer is nobody that's the ol that's the invisible hand at work and that's great and and that's a lesson that's
00:18:50 that Adam Smith figured out more than two hundred years ago and it's it continues to apply and the the but you
00:18:59 know even Adam Smith has a section his book about why it's important to regulate banks so the invisible hand has
00:19:06 its limits yeah and that example is actually a powerful one in terms of the supermarket and fruit that was my
00:19:11 experience coming from Russia from the Soviet Union is when I first entered a supermarket
00:19:17 and just seeing the assortment of fruit bananas yeah I don't think I've seen bananas before first of all but just the
00:19:24 selection of fresh fruit was just mind-blowing and it it beyond words and the fact that like like you said I don't
00:19:32 know what made that happen well then there is some magic to the market but the there's as showing my age but you
00:19:40 know the old movie quote sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't and you have to have some idea of when it
00:19:46 doesn't so how do you get regulation right how do what can government at its best to government strangely enough in this
00:19:56 country today seems to get a bad rap like everyone seems to everybody's against the government yeah well a lot
00:20:03 of money has been spent on making people hate the government but the reality is government does some things pretty well
00:20:12 I mean we government does health insurance pretty well so much so I mean given our anti-government bias there it
00:20:18 really is true that there are people out there saying don't let the government get its hands on Medicare so the
00:20:25 government that got people actually love the government health insurance program far more than they love private health
00:20:35 insurance basic education it turns out that your local public high school is the right place to have students trained
00:20:44 and private for certainly for-profit education is is a by and large a nightmare of ripoffs and and and grift
00:20:56 and and people not getting what they they thought they were paying for its judgment case and it's funny there are
00:21:04 things I mean everybody talks if there's the talks about the the DMV as being how do you want the economy and actually my
00:21:12 experience is that the DMV have always been positive maybe I'm just going to the right DMVs but in fact a lot of
00:21:20 government works pretty well so it you'd have to to some extent you can do these things on a priori grounds you can talk
00:21:27 about the logic of why healthcare is not gonna be handled well by the market but partly is just experience we tried where
00:21:33 these some countries have tried nationalizing their steel industries that didn't go well but we've tried
00:21:39 privatizing education and that didn't go well so you'd find out what works what about this new world of tech how do you
00:21:49 see what do you think works for tech is a more regulation or less regulation there are some things that need more
00:21:58 regulation and we're finding out that you know the world of social media is is one in which competitive forces aren't
00:22:09 working very well and trusting the companies to regulate themselves isn't working very well but I'm on the whole a
00:22:17 tech skeptic not in the sense that I think the tech doesn't work and it doesn't do stuff but the idea that we're
00:22:22 living through greater technological change than ever before is really an illusion we've ever since the beginning
00:22:31 of the Industrial Revolution we've had a series of ethical shifts in the nature of work and in the kinds of jobs that
00:22:40 are available and it's not at all clear that what we're at what's happening now is any bigger or faster or harder to
00:22:49 cope with than past shocks it is a popular notion in today's sort of public discourse that automation is going to
00:22:58 have a huge impact on job market now yeah there is something something transformational happening now he talked
00:23:07 about that maybe elaborate a little bit more do you not see the software revolutions happening now with with
00:23:16 machine learning availability of data that kind of automation being able to sort of process clean fine patterns and
00:23:25 data and you know you don't see that disrupting any one sector to a point where there's a huge loss of jobs there
00:23:33 may be some things I mean actually translators there's really reduced demand for translators because we've
00:23:40 translation ain't perfect but it ain't bad there are some kinds of things that are changed but it's not overall
00:23:53 productivity growth has actually been slowed in recent years now it's been much slower than in some past periods so
00:24:01 the idea that automation is taking away all the jobs the counterpart would be that we would be able to you know
00:24:07 produce stuff with many fewer workers than before and that's not happening there are a few isolated you know
00:24:13 sectors there are some kinds of jobs that that are going with but that keeps on happening I mean they New York City
00:24:20 used to have thousands and thousands of longshoremen taking stuff off off ships and tow putting them on ships they're
00:24:30 almost all gone now now you have these the giant cranes taking containers on and off ships in Elizabeth New Jersey
00:24:40 that's not robots it's doesn't doesn't sound high-tech but it actually pretty much destroyed that occupation well you
00:24:48 know that was it wasn't fun for the longshoremen to say the least and but it it's not we coped we moved on and that
00:24:57 that sort of thing happens all the time you mean farmers we we used to be a nation which was mostly farmers there
00:25:07 are now very few farmers left the end the reason is not that we've stopped eating it's that farming has become so
00:25:14 efficient that we don't need a lot of farmers and cope with that too so the the idea that there's something
00:25:20 qualitatively different about what's happening now so far isn't true you see yeah your intuition is there is going to
00:25:28 be a loss of jobs but it's just the thing that just continues though you know there's nothing qualitatively
00:25:33 different about this moment some jobs will be lost others will be created as has always been the case so far
00:25:39 maybe there's a singularity maybe there's a moment when when the machines get smarter than we are and sky tech
00:25:45 kills us all or something right but the but that's not visible in anything we're seeing now
00:25:52 you mentioned the metric of productivity could you explain that a little bit because it's a really interesting one
00:25:57 I've heard you mentioned that before the in connection with with automation so what what is that metric and if there
00:26:04 is something qualitatively different what should we see in that metric well okay productivity first of all
00:26:11 production we do have a measure of the total the economy's total production real GDP which is it's not that it's a
00:26:18 little bit of a construct because it's quite literally it's adding apples and oranges so we have to add together
00:26:25 various things which we basically do by using market prices but we try to adjust for inflation but it's kind of it's a
00:26:33 reasonable measure of how much the economy is producing and goods in sorry to interrupt is a goods and services and
00:26:38 services it's everything okay productivity is you divide that total output by the number of hours worked
00:26:47 so we're basically asking how much how much stuff does the average worker produce an hour of work and if you're
00:26:54 seeing really rapid technological progress then you would expect to see productivity rising at a rapid clip
00:27:03 which we did for in the generation after World War 2 productivity rose a 2% a year on a sustained basis then it
00:27:12 dropped down for a while then there was a kind of a decade of fairly rapid growth from the mid 90s to the mid 2000s
00:27:20 and then it's it dropped off again and it's not it's not impressive right now so you're just not seeing an ethical
00:27:29 shift in in in the economy so let me then ask you about the psychology of blaming automation a few months ago you
00:27:35 wrote in The New York Times quote the other day I found myself as I often do at a conference discussing lagging wages
00:27:42 and soaring inequality there was a lot of interesting discussion but one thing that struck me was how many of the
00:27:48 participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem that machines are taken away the good jobs or
00:27:55 even jobs in general for the most part this wasn't even a presented as a hypothesis just as part of what everyone
00:28:03 knows yeah so why is maybe can you psychoanalyze is our the puppet the public intellectuals or economists or us
00:28:12 actually the general public yeah why this is happening why this assumption is just infiltrated public discourse
00:28:20 there's a couple of things one is that the particular technologies that are advancing now are ones that are a lot
00:28:30 more visible to the chattering class the you know if when you had a point when containerization did away with the jobs
00:28:37 of longshoreman well not a whole lot of college professors are close friends with longshoremen right and so so we see
00:28:46 this one then there is a second thing which is you know we just went through its severe financial crisis and a period
00:28:52 of very high unemployment has finally come down the there's really no question that that high unemployment was about
00:29:01 macroeconomics it was about a failure of demand but macroeconomics is really not intuitive I mean people just have a hard
00:29:08 time wrapping their minds run it and among other things people have a hard time believing that something as trivial
00:29:14 as well people just aren't spending enough can lead to the kind of mass misery that we saw in the 1930s or that
00:29:21 not quite so severe but still serious misery that we saw after 2008 and there's always a tendency to say it must
00:29:27 be something big it must be technological change that means we don't need workers anymore that was a lot of
00:29:33 that in the 30s and that same thing happened after 2008 the assumption that it has to be something some deep cause
00:29:42 not something as trivial as a failure of investor confidence and inadequate monetary and fiscal response and the
00:29:54 last thing that wages did a lot of what's happened on wages is at some level political if the collapse of the
00:30:00 union movement it's the it's policies that have squeezed workers bargaining power and for kind of obvious reasons
00:30:07 there are a lot of influential people who don't want to hear that story they wanted to be an inevitable force of
00:30:14 nature technology is made it impossible to have people earn middle-class wage and they so that they don't they don't
00:30:23 like they they don't like the story that says actually no it's kind of the political decisions that we made that
00:30:28 have caused this this income stagnation and so there are a receptive audience for technological determinism so what
00:30:37 comes first in your view the economy or politics in terms of what has impact on the other
00:30:44 oh they looked at it everything interacts she has some one of the rules of that I was taught in economics
00:30:49 everything everything affects everything else in at least two ways but the the I mean clearly the economy drives a lot of
00:31:01 political stuff but also clearly politics has a huge impact on on on the economy there we we look at the decline
00:31:11 of unions in America and said well you know it's the world has changed and unions don't have a role but you know
00:31:17 two-thirds of workers in Denmark are unionized and Denmark face has the same technology and faces the same global
00:31:25 economy that we do is just a difference in political choices that leads to that difference so I actually teach a course
00:31:33 here at CUNY on called economics of the welfare state which is about things like health care and retirement and to some
00:31:40 extent wage policy and so on and the message I keep on trying to drive home is that look in all advanced countries
00:31:47 they've got roughly equal competence we all have the same technology but we make very different choices not that America
00:31:54 always makes the wrong choices we do some things pretty well our retirement system is is one of the better ones but
00:32:00 but the point is that the there's a huge amount of political choice involved in the in the shape of the economy what is
00:32:09 what is a welfare state well in welfare state is the old term that but it basically first all the programs that
00:32:17 are there to mitigate if you like the the risks and in justices of the market economies so in the US welfare state is
00:32:25 Social Security Medicare Medicaid minimum wages food stamps when you say welfare state my
00:32:34 first sir feeling is a negative one well I know I like all I probably generally at least theoretically like all the
00:32:41 welfare programs well that's it's been demonized and to some extent I'm being a little doing a
00:32:48 little bit of thumbing my nose at all of that by just using the term welfare state although it's not I see ya there I
00:32:56 got you but everybody every advanced country actually has a lot of of a welfare state than the US I mean we
00:33:05 that's fundamental part of the fabric of our society the Social Security Medicare Medicaid are just things we take for
00:33:15 granted as part of the scene and so if you you know that there there's a lot of there's people on the right wing who are
00:33:23 say oh it's it's it's all socialism and well I guess mean what you want them to mean and we just just today I I told my
00:33:37 class about the the record that Ronald Reagan made in 1961 warning that Medicare would destroy American freedom
00:33:47 and but sort of didn't happen on the topic of welfare state what are your thoughts on universal basic income and a
00:33:55 sort of a a gin not a generic but a universal safety net of this kind there's always a trade-off when we talk
00:34:04 about social safety net programs there's always a trade-off between universality which is clean but means that you're
00:34:12 giving a lot of money to people who don't necessarily need it and some kind of targeting which makes it easier to
00:34:23 get to deal with the crucial problems with limited resources but but both has incentive problems and kind of political
00:34:33 and I would say even psychological issues so the great thing about Social Security and Medicare is no questions
00:34:43 asked you know no you don't have to prove that you need them i it's comes you know I didn't I'm on medic
00:34:50 here I allegedly I mean it's it's run through my my my New York Times health insurance but you know I didn't have to
00:35:00 file an application with the Medicare office to prove that I needed it just happened when I turned 65 there's that's
00:35:08 good for dignity and it's also good for the political support because everybody gets Medicare on the other hand if you
00:35:20 and and we can do that with health care to give everybody a guarantee of an income that's enough to live on
00:35:28 comfortably but that's a lot of money what about enough income to carry you over to difficult periods like if you
00:35:37 lose a job that kind of well we have unemployment insurance and I think our unemployment insurance is too short
00:35:44 lived and too stingy it would be better to have a more comprehensive unemployment insurance benefit but the
00:35:52 trouble with with something like universal basic income is that either the bar is set too low so it's really
00:36:00 not something you can live on or it's an enormous ly expensive program and so at this point I think that we can do far
00:36:09 better by building on the kinds of safety net programs we have I mean food stamps Earned Income Tax Credit we
00:36:16 should have a lot more family support policies those things can deal with can do a lot more to really diminish the
00:36:25 amount of misery in this country ubi is something that is being I mean it it goes kind of hand-in-hand with with this
00:36:34 belief that the robots are going to take all of our jobs and if that was really happening then I might reconsider my
00:36:39 views on UPI but I don't see that happening so are you happy with this course as going on now in terms of politics so you
00:36:50 mentioned a few political candidates is is the kind of thing going on and on both on Twitter and debates in the media
00:36:59 through the written words is a spoken word how do you assess the public discourse now in terms of politics we're
00:37:08 in a fragmented world so more so more so than ever before so at this point the public discourse that you see if if
00:37:21 you're if Fox News is your principal news source is is very different from the one you get if you read the New York
00:37:27 Times on the whole my sense is that mainstream political reporting policy reporting is a not too great but be
00:37:38 better than it's ever been because of what when I first got into the you know the pundit business it was just awful
00:37:45 lots of things just never got covered and if things did get covered it was always both sides I mean it's the line
00:37:53 that comes back from me writing during the 2000 campaign was that it if one of the candidates said that the earth was
00:38:00 flat the the headline would de use differ on shape of planet I mean it's a and and it's that's less true there's
00:38:07 still a fair bit of that out there but it's less true than there used to be and there are more people reporting writing
00:38:14 on on policy issues who actually understand them than ever before so though that's good but I still I have
00:38:28 how much the typical voter is actually informed unclear I mean they the the Democratic debates I think we I'm hoping
00:38:40 that we finally get down to having a not having 27 people on the stage or whatever it is they have but but yeah
00:38:50 they're reasonably substantive certainly better than before and while there's a lot of still you know theater criticism
00:38:58 instead of actual analysis and the reporting it's it's not as totally dominant as in the past it can ask maybe
00:39:08 a dumb question but from an open-minded perspective when you know people on the left and people
00:39:15 on the right I think view the other the others as sometimes Complete Idiot's yeah it what
00:39:27 do we do with that you know is it possible that the people on the right are correct about their what they
00:39:37 currently believe is that kind of open-mindedness helpful or is this division long term productive for us to
00:39:49 sort of have this food fight well the trouble you have to confront is that there's a lot of stuff that just is
00:39:57 false out there and but commands extensive political allegiance so the idea well both sides need to listen to
00:40:04 each other respectfully I'm happy to do that when there's a view that is worthy of respect but a lot of stuff is not and
00:40:16 so take economics is something where I think I know something and I'm not sure that I'm always right in fact I know
00:40:24 I've been wrong plenty of times but I think there is a difference between economic views that are within the realm
00:40:33 of we can we can actually have an interesting discussion and those that are just crank doctrines or things that
00:40:43 that are purely being disseminated because people are being paid to disseminate them so there are there are
00:40:50 plenty of good serious center-right economists that are happy to to talk to none of those center-right economists
00:40:57 has any role in the Trump administration the Trump administration and by a large Republicans in Congress only want to
00:41:07 listen to people who are cranks and so I think it's being dishonest with my readers too to pretend otherwise there's
00:41:13 no way I can reach out to people who think that that reading ain't ran novels is is is how you learned about monetary
00:41:22 economics let me linger on that point so if you look at Iran okay so you said center-right what about
00:41:28 extreme people who have like radical views you think they're not grounded in any kind of data in the kind of reality
00:41:40 I'm just sort of curious about how open we should be to ideas that seem radical Oh radical ideas is fine but then you
00:41:48 have to asked I have to ask is there some basis for the radicalism and if it's if it's a if it's something that is
00:42:00 not grounded in anything then and particularly by the way if it's something that's been refuted by
00:42:06 evidence again and again and people just keep saying if it's a zombie idea and there's a lot of those out there then
00:42:13 there comes a point when it's not worth trying to fake respect for it I see so there's a through the
00:42:19 scientific process you've shown that this idea does not hold water but I like the idea zombie ideas but they live on
00:42:28 through it's like the idea that the earth is flat for example has been for the most part that's proven yeah but it
00:42:36 lives on actually is growing in popularity currently yeah and there's a lot of that out there and there you
00:42:44 can't you can't wish it away and it's you're not being fair to either yourself or if you're somebody who writes for the
00:42:50 public you're not being fair to your readers to pretend otherwise so quantum mechanics is a strange theory but it's
00:42:59 testable and so while being strangest widely accepted among physicists how robust and testable our economics
00:43:09 theories if we compare them to quantum mechanics and physics and so on okay economics look it's a complex system and
00:43:17 it's also one in which by and large you don't get to do experiments and so economics is never going to be like
00:43:26 quantum mechanics that said you get natural experiments you get tests of rival doctrines you know in the
00:43:33 immediate aftermath of the financial crisis there was one style one one basic theory of macroeconomics which
00:43:43 ultimately goes back to John Maynard Keynes that made a few predictions it said under these circumstances printing
00:43:51 money will not be inflationary running big budget deficits will not react cause a rise in interest rates slashing
00:43:59 government spending austerity policies will lead to two depressions if tried other people who had you know exactly
00:44:09 the opposite predictions and we got a fairly robust test and you know one one theory one interest rates stayed low
00:44:17 inflation stayed low austerity countries that implanted harsh austerity policies suffered severe economic downturns you
00:44:25 don't get much you know that's that's pretty clear and that's not going to be true on everything but there's a lot of
00:44:33 empirical I mean the younger economists these days are very heavy heavily data base syndrome and it's and that's great
00:44:41 and I'm I think that's that's the way to go what theories of economics there is there currently a lot of disagreement
00:44:51 about would you say Oh first of all there's just a lot less disagreement really among serious researchers in
00:44:57 economics than people imagine when we actually we contract that the Chicago Booth School has a panel an
00:45:04 ideologically diverse panel and they  oppose the regularly posed questions and on most thing there
00:45:13 there's a huge that there's remarkable consensus there's a lot of of things where there you people imagine that
00:45:20 there's dispute but that the the illusion of dispute is something that's basically being fed by political forces
00:45:27 and and there isn't really I mean there are I think we questions about what are effective ways to regulate technology
00:45:41 industries we really don't know the answer is there there's a or what I don't follow every part minimum wages
00:45:51 I think there's there's pretty overwhelming evidence that that a modest increase in the minimum wage from
00:46:00 current levels would be would not have any noticeable adverse effect on jobs but if you asked how high could it go
00:46:12 $12 seems pretty safe given what we know 15 is 15 okay there's some legitimate disagreement there I think probably but
00:46:23 but I can people have a point 20 where where is the line at which it starts to become a problem and the answer is truly
00:46:29 we don't know it's fascinating to try to such a cool economics is cool in that sense a you because you're trying to
00:46:35 predict something that hasn't been done before the impact the effects of something that hasn't been done before
00:46:41 yeah you're trying you're going out-of-sample and and we have good reason to believe that that there are no
00:46:48 that it's nonlinear that there comes a point at which it doesn't work the way it has in the past so as an economist
00:46:55 how do you see science and technological innovation when I took various economics courses in college technological
00:47:03 innovations seem like a no-brainer way of growing an economy and we should invest in it aggressively yeah I may be
00:47:11 biased but it seemed like the various ways to grow an economy it seems like the easiest way especially long term is
00:47:19 that correct and if so why aren't we doing it more well that's okay the first question is yeah I mean all
00:47:28 it's pretty much overwhelming we think we can more or less measure this although there are some assumptions
00:47:33 involved but it's something like 70 to 80 percent of the growth in per capita income is is basically the advance of
00:47:40 knowledge it's not just it's not just a crude accumulation of capital it is it is the fact that we can get smarter a
00:47:48 lot of that by the way is more prosaic kinds of technology so you know we I like to talk about things like
00:47:57 containerization or you know an earlier period the you know the invention of the flat a cardboard box I have to be invented
00:48:10 and and now all of your deliveries from Amazon are made possible by the existence of that technology that the
00:48:17 web stuff is important to but but what would we do without cardboard boxes so but all of that stuff is really
00:48:24 important in driving economic progress why don't we invest more why don't we invest more in you again
00:48:35 more prosaic stuff why aren't why haven't we built another goddamn real tunnel under the Hudson River which is
00:48:43 for which the need is is so totally overwhelmingly obvious how do you think about first of all I don't even know
00:48:48 what the word prosaic means but I inferred it but how do you think about prosaic is it the really most basic dumb
00:48:58 technology innovation or is it just like the lowest hanging fruit of war benefiting me gained when I say prosaic
00:49:08 I mean stuff that is not sexy and and fancy and high-tech it's building bridges and tunnels having inventing the
00:49:23 cardboard box were the I don't know where do we put EZ Pass in there that's a it is it is actually using some the
00:49:33 modern technology and all that but it it's you're not gonna have I don't think you're gonna make a movie about about
00:49:41 the fact that the guy who ever wasn't that easy pass but but it's actually a pretty significant productivity booster
00:49:48 to me it always seem like it's something that everybody should be able to agree on and just invest so like in the same
00:49:57 way there's the investment in the military and the DoD is huge so everyone kind of not everyone but there's a
00:50:09 there's a there's an agreement amongst people that somehow that a large defense is important it always seemed to me like
00:50:20 that should be shifted towards if you want to grow prosperity of the nation you should be investing in knowledge
00:50:27 yes prosaic stuff infrastructure investing infrastructure and so on I mean sorry to linger on it but do you
00:50:33 have any intuition do you have a hope that that changes the idea of intuition why it's not changing it's uncommon in
00:50:40 tradition I have a theory I'm reasonably certain that I understand why why we don't do it and it's it's because
00:50:53 because we have a real values dispute about the welfare state about how much the government should do to help the
00:51:03 unfortunate and politicians believe probably rightly that there's a kind of halo effect that surrounds any kind of
00:51:12 government intervention that even though providing people with enhanced Social Security benefits is really very
00:51:19 different from building a tunnel under the Hudson River politicians of both parties seem to believe that it's the
00:51:26 government is seen to be successful at doing one kind of thing it will make people think more favorably on doing
00:51:33 other kinds of things and so we have conservatives tend to be opposed to any kind of increase in government spending
00:51:43 except military no matter how obviously a good idea it is because they fear that it's the thin end of the wedge for
00:51:50 bigger government in general and to some extent liberals tend to favor spending on these things partly because they see
00:51:59 it as a way of proving that government can do things well and therefore it can turn to broader social goals it's
00:52:09 clearly can there's a if you like the what you might have thought would be a technocratic discussion about government
00:52:15 investment both in research and in infrastructure is contaminated by the fact that government is government and
00:52:23 people link it to other government actions perhaps silly question but as a species we're currently working on venturing out
00:52:30 into space one day colonizing Mars so when we start a society on Mars from scratch what
00:52:40 political and economic system should operate under oh I'm a big believer in first of all I don't think we're
00:52:46 actually gonna do that but does let's  let's imagine hypothesize that we colonize Mars or something look
00:53:00 representative democracy is vs. pure democracy well yeah but pure democracy where people vote directly on everything
00:53:09 his is really problematic because people don't have time to to to try and master every issue I mean we could see what
00:53:18 government by referendum looks like there's a lot of that in in California and it's  it doesn't work so good
00:53:23 because it's hard to explain to people that the various things they vote for may conflict so representative democracy
00:53:36 is it's got lots of problems and I kind of Winston Churchill thing right it's the worst system well you know except
00:53:43 for all the others but so yes thinking with a representative and basically the American system of regulation and
00:53:52 markets and the economy we have going on is a pretty pretty good one for Mars if you start from scratch if you didn't
00:53:59 start from scratch you wouldn't you wouldn't want to send it where sixteen percent of the population has half the
00:54:07 seats you probably would want one which is more actually more representative than what we have and the details it's
00:54:19 unclear I mean the we when times are good all of the various representative democracy systems whether it's
00:54:28 parliamentary democracies or a us-style system whether you have a prime minister or the head of state as an elected
00:54:35 president they all kind of work well then they all when times are good and they all have different modes of breakdowns
00:54:40 I'm not sure I know what the answer is but but something like that is given what we've seen through history it's the
00:54:51 least bad system out there I mean I don't know I'm a big fan of the TV series the expanse and it's kind of
00:55:05 gratifying that out there they the it's the Martian congressional republic okay in a brief sense so amongst many things
00:55:15 you're also an expert in international trade what do you make of the the complexity so I can understand trade
00:55:27 between two people say to neighboring farmers it seems pretty straightforward to me but international we need to start
00:55:34 talking about nations and nations trading seems to be very complicated so from a high level why is it so
00:55:41 complicated what are all the different factors that weigh the objectives need to be considered an international trade
00:55:49 and maybe feeding that into a question of you have concerns about the two giants right now of the u.s. in China
00:55:59 and an intention that's going on with the international trade there with the trade war well first of all
00:56:04 international trade is not really that different from trade among individuals when it's it it's vastly more complex
00:56:12 and there are there are many more players but in the end the reasons why countries trade are pretty much the same
00:56:18 as the reasons why individuals trade you countries trade because they're different and they can derive mutual
00:56:25 advantage from concentrating the things they do relatively well and also there are the economies of scale you know you
00:56:36 don't not individuals have to decide whether to be a surgeon or a or an accountant it's probably not a good idea
00:56:43 to try and be both in countries benefit from specializing just because of the inherent advantages of specialization
00:56:51 and that's so the now the the fact it's a big world and they were talking about millions of
00:56:57 products being traded and in today's world often trade involves many stages so that made in China iPhone is actually
00:57:07 assembled from components that are made all over the world and but it doesn't really change the the fundamentals all
00:57:16 that much there's a recurrence I mean that the baked the big the dirty little secret of international trade conflict
00:57:26 is that actually it's not conflicts among countries are really not that important most trade is beneficial to
00:57:35 both sides and to both countries but it has big impacts on the distribution of income within countries so the growth of
00:57:45 US trade with China has made both US and China richer but it's been pretty bad for people who were employed in the
00:57:54 North Carolina furniture industry who did find that their jobs were displaced by a wave of imports from China and so
00:58:03 that's where the complexity comes in not at all clear to me I mean they we have some real problems with China though
00:58:11 they really involve trade so much as as things like respect for intellectual property not clear that those real
00:58:20 problems that we do have with China have anything to do with the current trade war trade war seems to be driven instead
00:58:29 by a fundamentally wrong notion that when we sell goods to China that's good and when we buy goods from China that's
00:58:35 bad and that's that's misunderstanding the whole point he's a is trade which I'm in both directions a good thing yeah
00:58:43 we would be poorer if it wasn't for it but it but there are there are downsides as there are for any economic change
00:58:49 it's like any new technology makes us richer but often hurts some place some people trade with China
00:58:56 makes us richer but hurt some people and I I wouldn't undo what has happened but I wish we had had a better policy for
00:59:06 supporting incumbents the losers from that growth so we live in a time of rec reticle ization of
00:59:14 political ideas Twitter mobs and so on and yet here you are in the midst of it both tweeting and writing in New York
00:59:24 Times articles strong opinions riding this chaotic wave of public discourse do you ever hesitate or feel a tinge of
00:59:33 fear for exploring your ideas publicly and unapologetically oh I feel fear all the time
00:59:39 it's not too hard to imagine scenarios in which this is I might personally find myself kind of in there in the
00:59:49 crosshairs and I mean I'm the I am the king of hate mail I get them amazing correspondents  does it affect you it
00:59:57 did that it did when I started these days I've developed a very thick skin so I know I don't usually get in fact if I
01:00:06 if I don't get a wave of hate mail after a column then then I've probably wasted the that that day so what do you make of
01:00:15 that as a as a person who's putting ideas out there if you look at the history of ideas the way it works is you
01:00:21 write about ideas you put them out there but now when there is so much hate mail so much division what advice do you have
01:00:30 for yourself and for others trying to have a discussion about ideas difficult ideas well I don't know what about
01:00:38 advice for others I mean if for most economists you just do your research that's a we can't all be public
01:00:46 intellectuals and we shouldn't try to be and in fact I I I'm glad that I didn't get into this business until I was and
01:00:55 until I was in my late 40s I mean this is it's probably best to spend the the your decades of greatest intellectual
01:01:04 flexibility addressing deep questions not not confronting Twitter mobs and the and as for the rest point I think when
01:01:17 you're writing about stuff the sort of dance it's like no one's watching like nobody is reading right right what
01:01:23 your than what you think is right Jaya trying to make it obviously trying to make it it comprehensible and
01:01:31 persuasive but don't let yourself get intimidated by the fact that some people are going to say say nasty things it's
01:01:44 you can't you can't do you can't do your job if you are worried about criticism well I think I speak for a lot of people
01:01:51 and saying that I hope that you keep dancing like nobody's watching on Twitter and New York Times and books so
