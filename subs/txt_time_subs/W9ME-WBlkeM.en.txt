00:00:10 the milky way galaxy is home to billions of stars many of which are larger brighter and
00:00:15 hotter than the sun stars exist in a wealth of different varieties which drive their unrivaled sizes with
00:00:24 the scale ranging from stars the size of jupiter to stars larger than jupiter's orbit around the sun
00:00:31 you've likely all seen pictures of the latter various giant stars which completely dwarf the sun
00:00:37 rendering it as nothing more than a grain of sand next to a beast of the cosmos but how do we arrive at these conclusions
00:00:46 how do we measure stars to identify these mind-blowing sizes and above all which of them is the
00:00:56 biggest a star is a massive luminous sphere of mostly hydrogen and helium in a plasma state
00:01:13 a kind of ultra-energetic soup of free roaming atomic nuclei within a sea of electrons within the core of a star atoms are
00:01:21 under so much pressure from the body's gravitational influence that they are undergoing nuclear fusion
00:01:27 whereby the nuclei are stripped of their electrons and crushed into one another for most of a star's life hydrogen atoms
00:01:39 are fused into helium atoms like in our sun which converts some 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every
00:01:46 single second this process generates an incredible amount of outward pressure
00:01:52 which is counteracted by the star's gravity keeping the body held together so essentially a star is a
00:02:00 giant continuous explosion but how does this explosion start well to make a star the first thing you
00:02:08 need is gas stars form inside gaseous clouds containing large amounts of neutral
00:02:13 hydrogen and helium which are two of the most abundant elements in the universe
00:02:37 whereby the atoms can pack tightly enough to begin raising the temperature at the core of the cloud eventually
00:02:44 the atoms at the center are so tightly compressed that the pressure and energy strips off the atom's electrons
00:02:51 creating ions and the exposed hydrogen nuclei begin being crushed into one another thus igniting the star's fusion plasma furnace
00:03:01 the fusion in the core of the star forces the plasma outwards increasing the star's size however
00:03:09 the body itself has gained so much mass that it is generating an enormous gravitational influence
00:03:14 lugging the plasma back in towards the center these inward and outward forces counteract each other before settling
00:03:23 into a fragile balance of hydrostatic equilibrium where gravity and radiation pressure are in equal measure
00:03:30 the edge of the star where this balance is struck is marked by the photosphere the outer surface from which light is emitted
00:03:39 this is the edge we use to determine the star's absolute radius and thus its size when comparing other stars
00:03:49 the value is often given in solar radii a unit of measurement equivalent to the radius of the sun
00:03:57 about 695 700 kilometers this serves as an effective way to grasp the bewildering sizes of the largest stars
00:04:05 the size of a star depends largely on its mass and a number of factors affect how massive a star can become
00:04:12 particularly the amount and composition of star star-forming gas from which it came however
00:04:18 there is thought to be an upper bound limit for example you wouldn't find a star as large as a galaxy
00:04:24 because it wouldn't be able to keep itself held together the energy output of fusion at the core
00:04:32 of a star scales with the star's mass and so if a star is too massive then the fusion will be too energetic
00:04:38 and gravity will not be able to hold on to the star's structure similarly molecular clouds from which
00:04:49 stars form need to be a certain mass density and temperature in order to collapse and begin star formation
00:04:56 when gas clouds collapse pockets of greater density fragment from the global structure of
00:05:00 the cloud so instead of a gas cloud thousands of times the mass of the sun producing one
00:05:05 hypergiant star it is more likely to produce hundreds of smaller ones instead
00:05:12 with these constraints in mind old theoretical models have suggested size limits of around 1 500 solar radii
00:05:20 for the largest possible stars so that's 1 500 times the diameter of the sun
00:05:27 that is a size difficult to comprehend but what's even more surprising is that since then we have discovered a
00:05:33 handful of stars which seem to sit well above this incredible benchmark after a star has formed and its fusion
00:05:45 burning is underway it enters what is known as its main sequence with the hydrogen in the core of the
00:05:53 star gradually being turned into helium depending on the mass and composition of the star this main sequence burning
00:05:59 phase can take anywhere from a few million years in the most massive stars to billions of years for more stable
00:06:06 stars like the sun however stars do not vary that greatly in size during their main sequence
00:06:13 the main stage hydrogen burning is the coolest and thus least energetic kind of fusion that a
00:06:18 star will undergo and so does not produce as much outward pressure as other kinds
00:06:25 it is only when a star begins fusing elements heavier than hydrogen within its core
00:06:29 that it enters a much larger and more at the end of a star's main sequence all the hydrogen within the star's core has
00:06:38 been exhausted and fused into helium helium fusion requires much higher temperatures to occur
00:06:46 and so initially the outward pressure produced by the star lags tipping the balance of the forces in
00:06:52 favor of gravity causing the star to contract and shrink however as the core contracts more
00:06:59 matter is pulled into the center compressing the core further and heating it up again
00:07:05 meanwhile gravity pulls the precious little hydrogen remaining in the outer layers of the star further
00:07:11 in towards the area of the core which is hot enough for hydrogen fusion this leftover hydrogen then wraps around
00:07:18 the helium center in a shell-like structure within which fusion resumes the outer layers of the star then begin
00:07:26 absorbing the majority of this energy causing the star to balloon in size to tens or hundreds of times the size it
00:07:36 when this happens the surface area of the star greatly increases spreading the energy release more
00:07:43 sparsely across the surface this causes the star's surface temperature to fall to between 3000
00:07:51 and 5000 kelvin or so and appear redder the star has become a red giant thus the surface temperature of the star
00:07:58 falls but inside the core the temperature again begins increasing until the star reaches the threshold at
00:08:05 which the all helium core can be fused into carbon this significantly increases the energy output
00:08:13 of the fusion causing the star to swell up even more in about 5 billion years or so the sun
00:08:19 will eventually exhaust its hydrogen fuel and follow this process expanding to over 250 times its current
00:08:27 diameter engulfing mercury venus and probably the earth as well however our sun is only a medium mass star
00:08:37 which places limits on its fusion when the sun has finished fusing helium into carbon
00:08:42 it will not be able to reach the temperature required to fuse anything heavier and will become unstable initially
00:08:47 growing larger but ejecting around half of its mass into a surrounding nebula
00:08:55 before becoming a small white dwarf star in contrast stars much more massive than the sun can reach the compression levels
00:09:02 required in their cause to fuse the carbon leftover from helium fusion into heavier elements still
00:09:10 like oxygen sulfur and even silicon this generates even greater outward pressure allowing the largest giant
00:09:16 stars to expand to billions of kilometers in diameter this is how stars become truly huge in
00:09:24 the twilight of their lives red supergiant and hypergiant stars are the largest type of star we see in the galaxy
00:09:31 with some so large that they could engulf our entire inner solar system within their spheres
00:09:42 to determine a star's radius we need to know two key pieces of information one which we can directly and easily
00:09:51 measure is its angular diameter that is the size it appears when viewed from the earth
00:09:57 the second and much more elusive value is its distance from earth when we know the two we can scale up the
00:10:05 angular diameter and we have our star's actual size but this is easier said than done as it
00:10:11 is very difficult to calculate stellar distances precisely even with space telescopes most stars
00:10:18 appear as nothing more than tiny featureless dots of light due to their immense interstellar distances
00:10:25 and also due to interstellar radiation which hampers the light as it travels towards earth
00:10:31 there are also other problems for example many of the largest red giants and supergiants are unstable
00:10:38 and expel large amounts of material into their surrounding space creating nebulae dust bubbles and even
00:10:44 radiating taurus-like structures which obscure the star within and unfortunately a great many of the
00:10:51 stars in the milky way galaxy are impossible to see altogether the light from the milky
00:10:55 way's core drowns out a large number of stars within the densely populated heart of
00:11:01 the galaxy and similarly the dark dusty clouds along its arms block out large swathes
00:11:09 of outlying stars in short it is impossible to say what the largest star in the universe universes
00:11:15 or even the largest star in the galaxy for that matter but nevertheless we have managed to
00:11:23 identify our fair share of contenders fortunately for the stars that are large and local
00:11:28 their distances can be calculated directly using a form of triangulation also known as parallax
00:11:37 as shown in this demonstration when moving from side to side objects in the foreground appear to be
00:11:43 moving faster than background objects and we can apply this phenomenon to the stars as earth orbits the sun its position
00:11:51 changes every half year and so if we record the viewing angles of a star every six months
00:11:59 we can use some trigonometry to work out in practice this may not be done with visible light from a star
00:12:09 but rather through very long baseline radio emissions which are produced by mazers random spectral emissions generated by a
00:12:18 star's atmosphere parallax allows us to measure interstellar distances with a great
00:12:22 degree of accuracy but it only really works for nearby large and luminous red giants
00:12:30 for smaller or more distant stars the displacement of the object's emissions against the backdrop of space becomes
00:12:35 too subtle and standard parallax techniques have margins of error too large for the
00:12:44 as such we can only survey stars through parallax measurements accurately out to a distance of about 400 light years
00:12:52 not a very useful sample size when trying to find the largest star in the galaxy however all is not lost there are other
00:13:01 means to determine the distance of a star albeit in direct means but because we have a selection
00:13:07 of nearby stars that we can measure precisely through parallax this gives us a dictionary of known
00:13:13 stars whose well-understood properties can be used to deduce the characteristics of more remote stars
00:13:21 by comparing the spectral data of distant stars with the spectrums of stars whose properties we know
00:13:27 we can estimate the two things we need to find the radius of the star the luminosity and surface temperature
00:13:36 a star's luminosity is its intrinsic brightness not how bright it appears from the earth but rather a measure for the amount of
00:13:43 electromagnetic energy that is being emitted in watts when dealing with other stars we measure
00:13:50 this in terms of solar luminosity the energy output of the sun given by the international astronomical union to
00:13:58 be about 3.828 times 10 to the power of 26 watts because the most remote stars are too
00:14:06 far away to take direct spectral measurements astronomers instead take measurements of the star's emissions at different wavelengths
00:14:13 and then reproduce a spectrum that would best fit the data recorded once we have recreated our spectrum by
00:14:20 measuring the width of certain absorption lines it is possible to assign a spectral
00:14:25 class to the star the luminosity and temperature we can then infer from no nearby stars of same
00:14:33 spectral type certain spectral types are indicative of cooler red giants
00:14:39 with surface temperatures of around 5000 kelvin or lower whereas other types are indicative of
00:14:45 hot blue stars burning at tens or in truth there is a lot of guesswork and there are a number of variable factors
00:14:57 which makes some data harder to predict but once we have estimates for the luminosity and temperature of a distant star
00:15:03 we can apply these values to the equation used to deduce stellar luminosity based on the surface area and
00:15:11 temperature of said star by doing a bit of algebra we can extract the radius from the surface area
00:15:17 and rearrange the equation to solve for the radius of the star and finally with all these values
00:15:24 plugged in we arrive at an estimate for the star's size so with all that said and done what are
00:15:40 for a time it was thought that vy canis maduris was the largest star callus maduris is a red hypergiant
00:15:48 oxygen-rich pulsating variable star located in the constellation of canis major its distance is thought to be around 3
00:15:58 900 light years from the earth and it is thought to be located either within or slightly in the foreground
00:16:05 of a large molecular cloud known as sh2310 one of the largest star-forming regions in the milky way
00:16:12 and consequently home to many giant stars canis majiris is the largest and brightest of them all
00:16:20 it is extremely luminous even for a red supergiant owing to a heated disc or bubble around the star which gives off a
00:16:28 high infrared excess the star was first noted as early as 1801 and it continued to be observed
00:16:36 throughout the century by the start of the 1900s it was accepted that the star was an extreme object
00:16:43 and during this time astronomers had noted no less than six distinct bright patches around the star
00:16:50 leading to the hypothesis that it may be a binary star system or even larger by the end of the 20th century it was
00:16:58 known to be a post-main sequence red supergiant star and we now know that the bright
00:17:04 components observed are part of a highly reflective surrounding asymmetric nebula caused by explosions
00:17:11 and jets from the star's photosphere canis majiris is in the final stages of its life
00:17:17 and it is losing a lot of its mass as it fuses oxygen and other heavy elements within its core
00:17:23 much of the mass ejection is thought to have happened fairly recently within the last millennium or so and it
00:17:29 is indicative that the star does not have long left before it goes supernova
00:17:35 estimates of the star's size have varied over the decades due to its uncertain distance and also due to the fact that it is a
00:17:43 variable star which changes in size as it pulses studies in the late 90s suggested a
00:17:48 distance of around 1 800 light years thus implying a smaller radius but more recent and accurate studies
00:17:57 have yielded distances closer to 4 000 light years in 2006 and then again in 2007
00:18:04 it was estimated to be somewhere in the region of 1800 solar radii making it a hyper giant star as well as
00:18:13 the largest known star at the time today its radius has been more accurately measured to be around 1
00:18:20 420 solar radii but even at this size it would be sufficiently large as to engulf the
00:18:25 orbit of jupiter some 750 million kilometers away from the sun
00:18:34 of the few stars that are believed to rank above canis majeuris ui scooty is probably the most well known
00:18:41 spending much of the last decade as the largest known star like the former ui scooty is a pulsating
00:18:49 variable red supergiant star which is located in the constellation of scutum it is not visible to the naked eye and
00:18:58 even appears faintly to telescopes due to its location within the milky way's zone of avoidance
00:19:04 the section of the galaxy whose stars are obscured by the light from the galactic core
00:19:11 in addition the star pulses every two years or so and is shedding much of its mass making
00:19:16 accurate estimations difficult to constrain in 2013 ui scooty's distance was estimated to be around nine or ten
00:19:25 thousand light years away from the earth yielding a mind-blowing size of around 1 700 solar radii give or take about 200
00:19:35 to account for margins of error like canis majuris this size is enough to engulf the orbit of jupiter when
00:19:42 placed at the center of the solar system and photons traveling at light speed would take around
00:19:47 seven hours to travel along its circumference compared to the 14 and a half seconds they would require to
00:19:55 circle the sun like many other supergiant stars ui scooty is shedding a lot of its
00:20:00 material and blasting away its outer layers as it fuses heavier elements within its core and inevitably it will go supernova
00:20:08 soon because of its location deep within the galactic disk it may be a metal rich star if this is
00:20:15 the case then instead of going supernova by fusing iron and collapsing it may instead reach a hotter
00:20:21 temperature before death possibly evolving into either a yellow hypergiant luminous blue hypergiant or perhaps a
00:20:28 wolf reyes star a kind of very hot and very volatile star with a high metal content in all
00:20:36 three cases the star will produce strong eruptive stellar wind emissions so powerful that they will blow the
00:20:42 outer layers of the star away and expose the core causing a much brighter and more violent
00:20:49 kind of supernova however the star ends its life it spells bad news for any planetary system
00:20:55 orbiting the beast like the sun ui scooty may have a system of planets
00:21:01 many times larger than the solar system due to the star's tremendous size ui scooty's habitable zone the distance
00:21:09 from the star at which water could exist on the surface of a planet is thought to start at over 600
00:21:16 astronomical units away from the surface which would mean any life on a planet like this would experience
00:21:24 seasons that lasted for millennia in reality it is unlikely that anything is around to witness the star up close
00:21:31 as the constant ejections of mass and radiation from ui scooty's dying breaths will have rendered all but the most
00:21:39 remote planets uninhabitable the star's eventual supernova would send this planetary system
00:21:45 into further disarray likely obliterating most of the planets and perhaps ejecting very distant ones
00:21:50 on a trajectory out of the system casting them into the wilds of the galaxy as starless rogue planets
00:22:02 in 2018 data from the esa's gaia spacecraft re-evaluated ui scooty's distance using parallax measurements
00:22:09 giving a much lower distance of around 5000 light years which would correspond to a radius of
00:22:14 only 755 solar radii still enormous but not big enough to be record-breaking
00:22:23 however as we said earlier parallax measurements are less reliable for the very distant objects
00:22:29 and until further tests are done to validate the finding this lower distance and thus lower
00:22:34 radius for ui scuti ui scooty was the king of stars for many years but after the gaia data release cast
00:22:45 doubt over its true size the throne was once again opened for a new stellar champion
00:22:51 and though there have been a few proposed stars with larger diameters than ui scooty
00:22:57 one stands out as by far the largest beast discovered to date enter the latest and new largest known star
00:23:09 stevenson 2 18. stevenson 218 is located within the constellation of scutum
00:23:16 the same as ui scooty but lying significantly further away around 19 000 light-years from the earth
00:23:25 it lies within a densely populated star-forming region home to several massive open clusters
00:23:30 each containing their own enormous red giant and supergiant stars rs gc2 aka stevenson 2
00:23:42 is one such open cluster estimated to be around 20 000 light years distant and containing more than two dozen red supergiants
00:23:52 stevenson 218 lies within this area and it is the brightest star among them but it was not initially considered to
00:23:57 be a member of the cluster due to its outlying position and also its abnormally high luminosity when
00:24:05 compared to other cluster constituents however a later study concluded that the star was perhaps part of an outlying
00:24:12 group of stars to the cluster which is thought to lie at a similar distance to the rest of it
00:24:20 thus stevenson 218 had its name assigned as a member of the cluster however it stands out from its
00:24:25 neighboring giants being both significantly larger and more luminous than its surroundings
00:24:32 assuming that the star lies at a similar distance to the rest of the cluster then its luminosity is thought to be
00:24:38 around 440 above the theoretical luminosity limit for most stars which was once believed
00:24:47 to be around 320 the 1 500 solar radii size limits we spoke
00:24:56 about earlier but by applying stevenson 218's observed properties to the luminosity formula
00:25:04 they correspond to a staggering radius of 2149 solar radii making stevenson 218 by far the largest
00:25:12 star discovered yet and the first whose photosphere when replacing the sun would be capable of
00:25:19 engulfing not just the orbits of jupiter but the orbit of saturn as well which lies almost 10 times further away from
00:25:28 the sun than earth does this corresponds to a volume of almost 10 billion times that of our sun
00:25:34 and it's hard to appreciate just how large that truly is but what is even more bewildering is the
00:25:41 fact that it may get larger still as it ages stevenson 218 is thought to be a relatively young star
00:25:48 and the older it gets the hotter it will burn perhaps swelling further and evolving into a yellow hypergiant before it goes supernova
00:25:58 in any case it is considerably larger than both ui scooty and canis maduris and is by far the largest node star in
00:26:06 the local group over the years we have continually found larger and larger
00:26:12 stars and so it's reasonable to assume that something else will come along and knock stevenson 218 off the top of
00:26:19 the list before long but make no mistake it will take something truly remarkable to knock this monster
