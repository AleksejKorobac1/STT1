00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Colin angle he's the CEO and co-founder of iRobot a robotics company that for 29
00:00:09 years has been creating robots that operate successfully in the real world not as a demo or on a scale of dozens
00:00:17 but on a scale of thousands and millions as of this year iRobot has sold more than 25 million
00:00:26 robots to consumers including the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot the Bravo floor mopping robot and soon the Terra
00:00:35 lawn-mowing robot 29 million robots successfully operating autonomously in real people's homes to me is an
00:00:42 incredible accomplishment of science engineering logistics and all kinds of general entrepreneurial innovation most
00:00:52 robotics companies fail iRobot has survived and succeeded for 29 years I spent all day at iRobot including a
00:01:01 long tour and conversation with Colin about the history of iRobot and then sat down for this podcast conversation that
00:01:09 would have been much longer if I didn't spend all day learning about and playing with the various robots in the company's
00:01:15 history I'll release the video of the tour separately Colin iRobot its founding team its current team and its
00:01:24 mission has been and continues to be an inspiration to me and thousands of engineers who are working hard to create
00:01:33 AI systems that help real people this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it

00:01:47 Friedman spelled Fri D ma a.m. and now here's my conversation with Colin angle in his 1942 short story runaround from
00:01:58 his iRobot collection as a Asimov proposed the Three Laws of Robotics in order don't harm humans obey orders
00:02:07 protect yourself so two questions first does the Roomba follow these three laws and also more seriously what role do you
00:02:17 hope to see robots take in modern society in the future world so the three laws are very thought-provoking and
00:02:32 require such a profound understanding of the world a robot lives in the ramifications of its action and its own
00:02:44 sense of self that it's not a relevant bar at least it won't be a relevant bar for decades to come and so if Roomba
00:02:56 follows the three laws and I believe it does you know it is designed to help humans not hurt them it's designed to be
00:03:05 inherently safe and we design it to last a long time it's not through any AI or intent on the robots part it's because
00:03:15 following the Three Laws is aligned with being a good robot product so so I guess it does but it does by not by
00:03:27 explicit design so then the bigger picture well what role do you hope to see robotics robots take in our what's
00:03:37 currently mostly a world of humans we need robots to help us continue to improve our standard of living we need robots
00:03:53 because the average age of humanity is increasing very quickly and simply the number of people young enough and spry
00:04:05 enough to care for the elder growing demographic is inadequate and so what is the role of robots today the role is to
00:04:15 make our lives a little easier a little cleaner maybe a little healthier but in time robots are going to be the
00:04:24 difference between real gut wrenching declines in our ability to live independently and maintain our standard
00:04:33 of living and a future that is the bright one where we have more control of our lives can spend more of our time
00:04:47 focused on activities we choose and so honored and excited to be playing a role in that journey so you give me a tour it
00:04:54 showed me some of the long histories now 29 years that I iRobot has been at it creating some incredible robots who
00:05:01 showed me Pat bot he showed me a bunch of other stuff that led up to Roomba that led to Brava and Terra so let's
00:05:14 skip that incredible history in the interest of time because we already talked about it I'll show this
00:05:17 incredible footage you mentioned elderly and robotics and society I think the home is a
00:05:26 fascinating place for robots to be so where do you see robots in the home currently I would say once again
00:05:33 probably most homes in the world don't have a robot so how do you see that changing woody things the big initial
00:05:42 value add that robots can do so iRobot has sort of over the years narrowed in on the home the consumers home as the
00:05:53 place where we want to innovate and deliver tools that we'll help a home be a more
00:06:04 automatically maintained place a healthier place a safer place and perhaps even a more efficient place to
00:06:14 be and you know today we vacuum we mop soon we'll be mowing your lawn but where things are going is when do we get to
00:06:27 the point where the home not just the robots that live in your home but the home itself becomes part of a system
00:06:34 that maintains itself and plays an active role in caring for and helping the people who live in that home and I
00:06:43 see everything that we're doing as steps along the path toward that future so what are the what are the steps so if we
00:06:51 can summarize some of the history of Roomba the you've mentioned and maybe you can elaborate on it but you
00:06:57 mentioned that the early days were really taking a robot from something that works either in the lab or
00:07:04 something that works in the field that helps soldiers do the difficult work they do to actually be in the hands of
00:07:14 consumers and tens of thousands hundreds of thousands robots that don't break down over how much people love them over
00:07:21 months of very extensive use so that was the big first step and then the second big step was the ability to sense the
00:07:29 environment to build a map to localize to be able to build a picture of the home that the human can then attach
00:07:37 labels to in terms of you know giving some semantic knowledge to the robot about its environment okay so that's
00:07:46 like a huge two big huge steps now maybe you can comment on them but also what is the the the next step of of making a
00:07:56 robot part of the home sure so the goal is to make a home that that takes care of itself
00:08:04 takes care of the people in the home and gives a user and experience of just living their life in the home is somehow
00:08:11 doing the right thing lights when you leave cleaning up the environment and we went from robots that
00:08:26 were great in the lab but we're both too expensive and not sufficiently capable to ever do an acceptable job of anything
00:08:36 other than being a toy or curio in your home to something that was both affordable and sufficiently effective to
00:08:47 drive you know be a threshold and drive purchase intent now we've disrupted the entire vacuuming industry the number one
00:08:59 selling vacuums for example in the u.s. our room bows so not robot vacuums but vacuums and that's really crazy and
00:09:06 weird and yes we need to pause and that's incredible that's this is incredible that a robot is this is the
00:09:14 number one selling thing that does something yep everything as essential as vacuuming so we're it's still kind of
00:09:24 fun to say but they just because this was a crazy idea that that just started you know in a room here we're like do
00:09:35 you think we can do this hey let's give it a try but but now the robots are starting to understand their environment
00:09:45 and if you think about the next step there's two dimensions I've been working so hard since the beginning of iRobot to
00:09:56 make robots are autonomous that you know they're smart enough and understand their task enough they they can just go
00:10:04 do it without human involvement now what I'm really excited and working on is how do I make them less autonomous
00:10:14 meaning that the robot is supposed to be your partner not this automaton that just goes and does what a robot does and
00:10:23 so that if you tell it hey I just dropped some flower by the fridge in the kitchen not can you deal with it
00:10:30 wouldn't be awesome if the right thing just happened based on that utterance and to some
00:10:38 extent that's less autonomous because it's actually listening to you understanding the context and intent of
00:10:46 the sentence mapping it against its understanding of the home it lives in and knowing what to do and so that's an
00:10:57 area of research it's an area where we're starting to roll out features you can now tell your robot to clean up the
00:11:04 kitchen and it knows what the kitchen is and can do that and that's sort of 1.0 of where we're going
00:11:12 the other cool thing is that we're starting to know where stuff is and why is that important well robots are
00:11:22 supposed to have arms right data had an arm Rosie had an arm yeah Robbie the robot Hatter I mean brother you know
00:11:28 they are physical things that move her around in an environment they're supposed to like do work yeah and if you
00:11:34 think about it if a robot doesn't know anything where anything is why should it have an arm but with this new dawn of
00:11:45 home understanding that we're starting to go enjoy I know where the kitchen is I might in the future know where the
00:11:53 refrigerators I might if I had an arm be able to find the hand I'll open it and even get myself a beer obviously that's
00:12:02 one of the true dreams of robotics as Deb robots bringing us a beer while we watch television but you know I think
00:12:11 that that new category of tasks where physical manipulation robot arms is a just a potpourri of new opportunity and
00:12:21 excitement and you see humans as a crucial part of that so you kind of mentioned that and I
00:12:28 personally find that a really compelling idea I think full autonomy can only take us so far
00:12:36 especially in the home so you see humans is helping the robot understand or give deeper meaning to the spatial
00:12:44 information right it's it's a partnership the robot is supposed to operate according to descriptors that
00:12:56 you would use to describe your own home the robot is supposed to in lieu of better direction kind of go about its
00:13:05 routine which ought to be basically right and lead to a home maintained in a way that it's learned you like but also
00:13:21 be perpetually ready to take direction that would activate a different set of behaviors or actions to meet a
00:13:29 current need to the extent it could actually perform that task so I gotta ask you I think this is a fundamental
00:13:37 and fascinating question because iRobot has been a successful company and a rare successful robotics company so Anki
00:13:46 geebo Mayfield robotics with a robot curry sci-fi works rethink robotics these were robotics companies that were
00:13:54 founded and run by brilliant people but all very unfortunately for at least for us roboticists that and all went out of
00:14:02 business recently so why do you think they didn't last longer why do you think it is so hard to keep a robotics company alive
00:14:13 you know I say this only partially in jest that back in the day before Roomba you know I was a I was a high-tech
00:14:24 entrepreneur building robots but it wasn't until I became a vacuum cleaner salesman that we had any success so
00:14:32 though I mean the point is technology alone doesn't equal a successful business we need to go and find the
00:14:44 compelling need where the robot that we're creating can deliver clearly more value to the end user than it costs and
00:14:59 it's this is not a marginal thing where you're looking at the skin like it's closed maybe we can hold our breath and
00:15:06 make it work it's clearly more value than the the cost of the robot to bring you know in the store and I think that
00:15:18 the challenge has been finding those businesses where that's true in a sustainable fashion
00:15:31 you know the the when you get into entertainment style things you could be the cat's meow one year but 85% of toys
00:15:44 regardless of their merit fail to make it to their second season it's just super hard to do so and so that that's
00:15:56 just a tough business and there have been a lot of experimentation around what is the right type of social
00:16:05 companion what is the right robot in the home that is doing something other than tasks people do every week that they'd
00:16:19 rather not do and I'm not sure we've got it all figured out right and so that you get brilliant roboticist with super
00:16:29 interesting robots that ultimately don't quite have that magical user experience and thus the that value benefit equation
00:16:41 remains ambiguous so you as somebody who dreams of robots you know changing the world what's your estimate why how big
00:16:54 is the space of applications that fit the criteria that you just described where you can really demonstrate an
00:17:00 obvious significant value over the alternative non robot bought a solution well I think that we're just about none
00:17:11 of the way to achieving the potential of robotics at home but we have to do it in a really eyes wide open
00:17:23 honest fashion and so another way to put that is the potentials infinite because we did take a few steps but you're
00:17:29 saying those steps is just very initial steps so the Rumba is a hugely successful product but you're saying
00:17:35 that's just the very very just the very very beginning it's the foot in the door and you know I think I was lucky that in
00:17:45 the early days of robotics people would ask me when are you gonna clean my floor it was something that I grew up saying I
00:17:54 got all these really good ideas but everyone seems to want their floor clean and so maybe we should do that Betty
00:18:04 your good ideas earned the right to do the next thing after that so the good ideas have to match with the desire of
00:18:12 the people and then the actual cost has to like the business the financial aspect has to all mash together yeah I
00:18:20 during our partnership back a number of years ago Johnson wax they would explain to me that they would go into homes and
00:18:32 just watch how people lived and try to figure out what were they doing that they really didn't really like to do but
00:18:42 they had to do it frequently enough that it was top of mind and and understood as a a burden hey let's make a product or
00:18:56 come up with a solution to make that pain point lesyk less challenging and sometimes we
00:19:06 do certain burdens so often as a society that we actually don't even realize like it's actually hard to see that that
00:19:12 burden is something that could be removed so it does require just going into the home and staring it wait how do
00:19:20 I actually live life what are the pain points yeah and it getting those insights is a lot harder than it would
00:19:30 seem it should be in retrospect so how hard on that point I mean one of the big challenges of robotics is driving the
00:19:41 cost to something driving the cost down to something that consumers people would afford so people would be less likely to
00:19:51 buy a Roomba for cost $500,000 right which is probably sort of what a Roomba would costs
00:20:00 several decades ago so how do you drive which I mention is very difficult how do you drive the cost of a Roomba or a
00:20:06 robot down such that people wouldn't want to buy it when I started building robots the cost of the robot had a lot
00:20:14 to do with the amount of time it took to build it and so that we build our robots out of aluminum I would go spend my time
00:20:21 in the machine shop on the milling machine cutting out the the the parts and and so forth and then when we got
00:20:32 into the toy industry I realized that if we were building at scale I could determine the cost of the rope instead
00:20:38 of adding up all the hours to mill out the parts but by weighing it and that's liberating you can say wow the world is
00:20:50 has just changed as I think about construction in a different way the 3d CAD tools that are available to us today
00:21:00 the operating at scale where I can do tooling and injection mold an arbitrarily complicated part and the
00:21:10 cost is going to be basically the weight of the plastic in that part is incredibly exciting and liberating and
00:21:18 opens up all sorts of opportunities and for the sensing part of it where we are today is instead of trying
00:21:30 to build skin which is like really hard for a long time spent creating strategies and and ideas around how
00:21:41 could we duplicate the skin on the human body because it's such an amazing sensor the instead of going down that path
00:21:55 why don't we focus on vision and how many of the problems that face a robot trying to do real work could be solved
00:22:07 with a cheap camera and a big-ass computer yeah and Moore's Law continues to work the cell phone industry the
00:22:17 mobile industry is giving us better and better tools that can run on these embedded computers and I think we passed
00:22:28 a an important moment maybe two years ago where you could put machine vision capable processors on robots at consumer
00:22:41 price points and I was waiting for it happed to happen we avoided putting lasers on our robots to do navigation
00:22:51 and instead spent years researching how to do vision based navigation because you could just see it where these
00:23:03 technology trends were going and between injection molded plastic and a camera with a computer capable of running
00:23:11 machine learning and visual object recognition I could build an incredibly affordable incredibly capable robot and
00:23:21 that's gonna be the future you know on that point with a small tangent but I think an important one another industry
00:23:28 in which I would say the only other industry in which they're true there is automation actually touching
00:23:35 people's lives today is autonomous vehicles mm-hmm what the vision each is described of using computer vision and
00:23:44 using cheap camera sensors that's there's a debate on that of lidar versus computer vision and sort of the Elon
00:23:54 Musk famously said that lidar is a crutch that really in camera in the long term camera only is the right solution
00:24:02 which echoes some of the ideas you're expressing of course in terms of its safety criticality is
00:24:08 different but what do you think about that approach in the autonomous vehicle space and in general do you see a
00:24:17 connection between the incredible real-world challenges you have to solve in the home with Roomba and I saw a
00:24:23 demonstration of some of them corner cases literally and autonomous vehicles so there's absolutely a tremendous
00:24:35 overlap between both the problems you know a robot vacuum and a Thomas vehicle are trying to solve and the tools and
00:24:42 the types of sensors that are being applied in the pursuit of the solutions in my world my environment is actually
00:24:55 much harder than the environment and automobile travel we don't have roads we have t-shirts we have steps we have a
00:25:06 near infinite number of patterns and colors and surface textures on the floor especially from a visual perspective
00:25:14 yeah wait William looks it's really tough is an infinitely variable on the other hand safety is way easier on the
00:25:25 inside my robots they're not far you heavy they're not very fast if they bump into your foot you think it's funny and you
00:25:37 know and autonomous vehicles kind of have the inverse problem and so that for me saying vision is the future
00:25:49 I can say that without reservation for autonomous vehicles I think I believe what you know I'm saying about the
00:25:58 future is ultimately going to be vision maybe if we put a cheap lighter on there as a backup sensor it might not be the
00:26:03 worst idea in the world so the something so much hi thanks so much higher that's you much more careful
00:26:09 thinking through how far away that feature is right right and but I think environmental understanding sensor is
00:26:22 going to be a visual system visual system so on that point well let me ask do you hope there's an AI robot robot in
00:26:30 every home in the world one day I expect there to be at least when I robot robot in every home you
00:26:40 know we've we've sold 25 million robots so we're in about 10 percent of US homes which is a great start but I think that
00:26:51 when we think about the numbers of things that robots can do you know today I can vacuum your floor mop your floor
00:27:00 cut your lawn or soon we'll be able to cut your lawn but there are more things that we could do in the home and I hope
00:27:11 that we continue using the techniques I described around exploiting computer vision and low cost manufacturing that
00:27:19 we'll be able to create these solutions at affordable price points so let me ask on that point of a robot in every home
00:27:27 that's my dream as well I'd love love to see that I you know I think the possibilities there are indeed infinite
00:27:35 positive possibilities but you know in our current culture no thanks to science fiction and so on there's a serious kind
00:27:45 of hesitation anxiety concern about robots and also a concern about privacy and it's a fascinating question to me
00:27:58 why that concern is amongst a certain group of people as as intense as it is so you have to think about it because
00:28:06 it's a serious concern but I wonder how you address it best so from a perspective of a vision sensor so robots
00:28:12 that move about the home and sense the world how do how do you alleviate people's privacy concerns how do you
00:28:21 make sure that they can trust iRobot and the robots that they share their home with I think that's a great question
00:28:33 and we've really leaned way forward on this because given our vision as to the role the company intends to play in the home
00:28:46 really for us make-or-break is can our approach be trusted to protecting the data and the privacy of the people who
00:28:55 have our robots and so we've gone out publicly the privacy manifesto stating we'll never sell your data we've adopted
00:29:04 GDP are not just where GDP are is required but globally we have ensured that any that images don't leave the
00:29:21 robot so processing data from the visual sensors happens locally on the robot and only semantic knowledge of the home with
00:29:33 the consumers consent is sent up we show you what we know and are trying to go use data as an enabler for the
00:29:45 performance of the robots with the informed consent and understanding of you know we take it very seriously and
00:30:00 ultimately we think that by showing a customer that you know if you let us build a semantic map of your home and
00:30:09 know where the rooms are well then you can say clean the kitchen if you don't want to robot to do that don't make the
00:30:16 map it'll do its best job cleaning your home but it won't be able to do that and if you ever want us to forget that we
00:30:23 know that it's your kitchen you can have confidence that we will do that for you so we're trying to go and be a sort of a
00:30:36 data 2.0 perspective company where we treat the data that the robots average of the consumers home as if it were the
00:30:45 consumers data and that they have rights to it so we think by being the good guys on this front we can build the trust and
00:30:57 thus be entrusted to enable robots to do more things that are thoughtful you think people's worries will diminish
00:31:06 over time as a society broadly speaking do you think you can win over trust not just for the company but just the
00:31:13 comfort of people have with AI in their home enriching their lives in some way I think we're an interesting place today
00:31:22 we're less about winning them over and more about finding a way to talk about privacy in a way that more people can
00:31:30 understand I would tell you that today when there's a privacy breach people get very upset and then then go to the store
00:31:38 and buy the cheapest thing paying no attention to whether or not the products that they're buying honor privacy
00:31:44 standards or not in fact if I put on the package of my Roomba the privacy commitments that we have I
00:31:57 would sell less than I would if I did nothing at all and that needs to change so it's it's not a question about
00:32:03 earning trust I think that's necessary by not sufficient we need to figure out how to have a comfortable set of what is
00:32:12 the grade a meet standard applied to privacy that customers can trust and understand and then use in the buying decisions
00:32:24 that will reward companies for good behavior and that will ultimately be how this moves forward and maybe be part of
00:32:33 the conversation between regular people about what it means what privacy means if you have some standards you can say
00:32:40 you're gonna start talking about who's following them who's not have more because most people are actually quite
00:32:46 clueless about all aspects of artificial intelligence of data collection so on it would be nice to change that for people
00:32:52 to understand the good that AI can do and it's not some some system that's trying to steal all the most sensitive
00:33:02 data yep do you think do you dream of a Roomba with human level intelligence one day so you've mentioned a very
00:33:11 successful localization and mapping of the environment being able to do some basic communication to say go clean the
00:33:19 kitchen do you see and you're maybe more bored moments once you get the beer to sit back with that beer and have a chat
00:33:31 on a Friday night with the Roomba about how your day one so true your latter question absolutely
00:33:40 - your former question as to whether robot can have human level intelligence not my lifetime you can have you I think
00:33:49 you can have a great conversation a meaningful conversation with a robot without it having anything that
00:33:59 resembles human level intelligence and I think that as long as you realize that conversation is not about the robot and
00:34:08 making the robot feel good that conversation is about you learning interesting things that make you feel
00:34:18 like the conversation that you had with a pretty awesome way of learning something and it could be about what
00:34:31 kind of day your pet had it could be about you know how can I make my home more energy-efficient it could be about
00:34:40 you know if I'm thinking about climbing Mount Everest what should I know and that's a very doable thing you know but
00:34:51 if I think that that conversation gonna have of the robot is I'm gonna be rewarded by making the robot happy but I
00:34:58 couldn't have just put a button on the robot you could push in the robot would smile and that sort of thing so I think
00:35:04 you need to think about the question in the the right way and and robots can be awesomely effective at helping people
00:35:16 feel less isolated learn more about the home that they live in and fill some of those lonely gaps that we wish we were
00:35:25 engaged learning cool stuff about our world last question if you could hang out for a day with a robot from science
00:35:36 fiction movies books and safely pick safely pick its brain for that day who would you pick data data from Star Trek
00:35:49 I think that a data is really smart data's been through a lot trying to go and save the galaxy and I'm really
00:35:59 interested actually in emotion and robotics and I think he'd have a lot to say about that because I believe
00:36:08 actually that emotion play is an incredibly useful role in doing reasonable things in situations where I
00:36:17 have imperfect understanding of what's going on in social situations on there's been perfect information in social
00:36:25 situations also in competitive or dangerous situations that we have a motion for a reason and
00:36:36 so that ultimately this my theory is that as robots get smart and smarter they're actually going to get more
00:36:46 emotional because you can't actually survive on pure logic because only a very tiny fraction of the situations you
00:36:55 find ourselves and can be resolved reasonably with logic and so I think data would have a lot to say about that
00:37:00 and so I could find out whether he agrees what if you could ask data one question you would get a deep honest
00:37:08 answer to what would you ask what's Captain Picard really like okay I think that's the perfect way to end the call
