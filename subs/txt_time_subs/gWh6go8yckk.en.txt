00:00:01 surely you're not gonna wear that sure for this video I am and don't call me Shirley TV networks cancelled good shows
00:00:13 all the time usually they're very stupid reasons however perhaps no network as up harder than ABC when they
00:00:20 cancelled police squad is exactly one executive for the show told too many jokes for audiences to keep up with a
00:00:24 police squad I'd like to see captain Harper of course lieutenant Fleming it driven I'm
00:00:33 assuming some people will have seen police work and that's not all that surprising because there were a grand
00:00:40 total of six episodes of police squad released for his own ceremoniously booted off the air for reasons we'll
00:00:45 discuss in a moment however it's quite easy to described it's basically a serialized version of The Naked Gun
00:00:51 movies and if you've not seen the Nickey good movies here's a clip to demonstrate I probably also point out after showing
00:01:05 you that clip that the naked girl movies grossed hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office
00:01:09 after police squad was kicked off the air and the writers we cycled all the plot lines they never got to use for the
00:01:15 movies so yeah double good work on that one ABS leaders took the idea they're gonna use for your police procedural
00:01:21 show and using to make multi-million dollar grossing movies what a great lateral move that is that instead of
00:01:26 having three movies that are an hour and a half long each we could've had like 15 seasons of this that Leslie Nielsen
00:01:32 his comedic prime and they also had wish point as well this show was written by the guys who wrote airplane No thank you
00:01:43 I take it back like my man all right so let's see they've got the guys who wrote one the funniest movies ever made and
00:01:48 they've got Leslie Nielsen on the greatest comedy actors ever and then the actual general plot of the show was
00:01:54 later recycled into one the funniest series of films ever made and they cancelled it because you had too many
00:02:01 jokes in it Wow Wow may I check your code thank you Greta's talked about Leslie Nielsen for a moment
00:02:12 as well I need to point this out for noting any of people know Leslie Nielsen started his career as a serious actor
00:02:18 people today know he was like this comedy actor but no you start screaming like 20 years it's like a leading man in
00:02:25 like romance films us what none of which you've aged very well we cease delivery and all the comedy films he later did is
00:02:30 the exact same as it wasn't he was a serious actually didn't change anything so you can point like a cliff think of
00:02:35 Poseidon Adventure or something like that where he was the captain or some and it's still hilarious to me now
00:02:46 is one of fun of his work here's my favorite part Brad you know how Leslie Nielsen went with me like a leading man
00:02:52 in romantic dramas so like the like lead in comedy police films it Ferrer playing when they were casting the film
00:03:01 and the writers Zuka Abrams oka when you know what hiring comedy actors cuz comedy actors can't read our lines
00:03:06 properly what we're going to do is only hire serious drama actors and they got Leslie Nielsen
00:03:13 the idea was read these lines like you're being 100% serious excuse me sir I'm sorry I have to wake your your
00:03:21 doctor that's right and obviously comedy actors cavities they trying I'll try and make it kooky
00:03:26 and wacky so no read it out actually the most serious thing in the world and that's what Leslie Nielsen Kaif and so
00:03:31 his deadpan delivery and that's how they realize like oh my god this guy's a gene I don't feel like
00:03:37 these videos as funny as it could be we don't have any jokes so far away well we don't need to all right yeah Leslie's
00:03:45 got our back honey thanks Leslie oh good I sent the note for the lab they're demanding $1,000,000 I would the lab
00:03:53 demand a billion dollars kidnappers made the demand Frank I don't do anything it's great yeah well I was taking a load
00:04:00 off I get to relax now I feel like this shirt is very relevant to the video I'm just taking a really relaxed day you
00:04:06 know what I want to crack open this boob and you see over the next video I'm gonna crack it open early you just made
00:04:13 me put me at complete ease I don't have to be funny because Leslie Nielsen's gonna make all the jokes for me just
00:04:18 don't drink your beer for a bit I'll just throw in a few clips now we go at a sidebar Sears
00:04:34 clip these another one this one's quite good and this one's a personal favor as an idea of how funny police squad was
00:04:53 twenty years after the series was taken off the air a DVD boxset of the only six episodes ever produced in film was
00:04:59 immediately nominated for a Satellite Award and was only narrowly beaten out by season 8 of The Simpsons that's one
00:05:06 of the early seasons of the citizeness even it's a good season oh yeah it's not just a good season Brad it's the one
00:05:24 police squad have six episodes in total ever like The Simpsons I only have like you know the decade I sold like public
00:05:31 goodwill and let you know brand recognition he had bought at that point and all the previous episodes like
00:05:35 season eight box that of the Simpson had like 25 episodes on it all of which were solid gold
00:05:41 and like it was competing toe-to-toe with like police squad six episodes and some behind the scenes forties they
00:05:48 might just great together that's I oh my god so the police people watching home after him that's not that
00:05:53 impressive because like it didn't win the award but I think the fact it was even nominated when there were six
00:05:59 episodes total in existence it's competing against like 30 episodes of Golden Age Simpsons which at the time
00:06:07 was I know more relevant here we got this show from 20 years ago at six episodes ever and The Simpsons was like
00:06:13 yeah and people were generally thinking oh yeah I think police squad might being informed a winner here because obviously
00:06:18 in the realm of comedy seems like holy grail of like comics like the guys who made airplane and
00:06:24 Leslie Nielsen in his prime working together to make a half an hour of this amazing television per week that
00:06:30 was like just erased from existence before his time yes I know well speaking of The Simpsons I'm not just mentioning
00:06:40 it because I'm not feeling all farms day what Brad's putting some funny clips to make up for that fact Matt Groening the
00:06:45 creator The Simpsons has gone on record as saying if police squad had been released 20 years later it would have
00:06:51 been a ratings juggernaut which Shandy why not grant line why was Mike really sort of because of the success of The
00:07:01 Simpsons and he saw a lot of similarity view in the comedy of each show so I've seen police squad and the Simpsons a lot
00:07:05 of like sight-gags a lot of like slapstick but also the Saints have a lot more nuanced humor and
00:07:10 I don't think like migraines all the ups giving like you know police squaddies fair dues because I think the humor in
00:07:15 police squad and in the writing of it there was like a lot more nuance and there is in the Simpsons small the
00:07:20 wordplay so if you know that sauce they asked what soccer offenses are called really well-known forces a lot of like
00:07:25 police squadron that not police well a lot of that in the naked girl moves a lot of in air playing I think one of my
00:07:31 favorite lines obviously is like how did you get in here and who are you a locksmith and I'm a locksmith Brit like
00:07:39 eats there's so much in that like to unpack in that line another one where it's just like oh we're really sorry for
00:07:44 your loss we would have come earlier but your husband wasn't dead then so brilliant and just so flat
00:07:50 I don't think since it has a lot of that wordplay in it so it has an extra layer that I think might elevates it above all
00:07:57 the forms of like you know comedy on TV which is why I think so many like comedy writers and comedians like respect it so
00:08:04 much and feel like the fact it was cancelled he's like such an injustice to the world of comedy it basically robbed
00:08:09 us of like hundreds of hours of Leslie Nielsen just being Leslie Nielsen yes very impressive but we just like to ask
00:08:17 a few questions apparently ABC disagreed that police what was the wall on the funniest shows
00:08:23 on television and cancelled after just four episodes have aired citing a poor audience reaction as the reason it was
00:08:42 an audience's actually loved the show I should mention that it was aired after airplane had been released so I you know
00:08:47 well Leslie Nielsen was quite a big star town a lot of draw and star power so the excusive ABC that you know poor
00:08:54 audience response is the reason we know we canceled the show didn't sit well with people so they
00:08:59 pressed ABC for the real reason they canceled the show and boy was the answer stupidest
00:09:05 so go on Kyle what is this stupid reason that it was cancelled well after a lot of prodding a executive
00:09:11 ABC Cortona Thermopolis revealed or no much duress and the reason the show was canceled is because executives at ABC
00:09:17 were worried that audiences couldn't keep up with the amount of jokes being told specifically smokeless would later
00:09:27 be quoted as saying an audience has to watch police squad to appreciate it well yeah you know like a TV show and like
00:09:36 people aren't regressing this this was like you know before the era of Netflix and YouTube so like people weren't
00:09:41 watching this thing in the background while while looking at their phone like police squad had a completely passive
00:09:48 audience so if people miss Joe that were told that was completely on them I should also point out as well in
00:09:55 no review or any feedback from any like no audience at the time was the fact they missed the jokes
00:10:01 a complaint as well add great reviews people love this show so the fears that they had about people not getting the
00:10:08 jokes were completely unfounded there wasn't like a feedback they'd had from audience members say no he's getting
00:10:13 really about critics loved it but audiences hate --ax extract there's too many jokes they did it because they were
00:10:19 genuinely worried that some point in time in the future someone somewhere might feel stupid if they didn't get
00:10:25 every joke which I'm guessing why shows someone's gonna make that joke in the comments i snotted get there first so ii
00:10:36 thought the show was too clever yeah they thought people were too stupid to understand jokes and i get it some of
00:10:42 the jokes probably would go over some people's heads you know I in the Simpsons wears a lot of jokes in there
00:10:47 that went over people's head I think the famous ugly Sneed seed and feed which is a sight gag in one episode I forget
00:10:53 which one I think it's the tomato episode yeah you put the clip in it's only if it formally Chuck's and that's
00:11:06 why those jokes are always comes almost like old dirty jokes you missed in the Simpsons and people to this day still
00:11:11 don't get all that joke it's and I'm not going to explain X you either get it or you don't but the facts like that people
00:11:16 might not get it isn't reason to not put it in and the father ABC what I'll people might not get every single joke
00:11:22 told if there's a good job like 40 per minute isn't there it's good job these each of these absolutely crammed
00:11:28 with like you know not only wordplay but I you know sight gags and slapstick and just
00:11:34 regular jokes mr. Drebin dr. zubowski will see you now you're next you might like soul-crushing that wants to be in
00:11:44 fact Leslie Nielsen the people like the writers so why we getting canceled is too funny to say awful why we break you
00:11:52 know you sat down a restaurant where you girlfriend in the site Oaks I think we should see other people
00:11:57 what's wrong I thought I've been a good boy for you have a bit attentive to all my knees you've been the most part
00:12:01 boyfriend ever say so why are we breaking she just like sitting up it I think it's nice your penis he's just too big you
00:12:09 see that she leaves it's not there in the restaurant everyone there's just a grid and that my crane is in the corner
00:12:18 kawin mate if only they knew appreciate you appreciate I can't believe how naive I was to think that you were gonna say
00:12:28 you're too good you know in this show it always comes back to peanuts there's a quote for a t-shirt there is
00:12:37 back feed it always comes back to the peanuts and that ladies and gentlemen is a story of how potentially when the
00:12:43 funniest TV show ever made was canceled for perhaps one of the stupidest reasons ever given by an executive working for a
00:12:48 TV studio perhaps though there's an upside of the cancellation of police squad you know it can serve as an
00:12:53 example to all the TV studios that randomly cancelling hype a popular police procedural comedy show saying
00:12:58 famous comedy actors but no real reason what is your favorite Leslie Nielsen appearance on movie we've talked about
00:13:17 it before I mean it's obviously scary movie 3 we've talked about that length of the video so what's yours I like you
00:13:23 in Dracula dirt illuminator which I don't think gets as much credit as it sure I've not seen that one so you did a
00:13:28 lot of spoof films in the after the success of police squad and yes by out I like that one because and there's a
00:13:36 theme song isn't the theme song sung by Weird Al and I believe doing the theme so it's like a spoof of all like the
00:13:42 Bond movie like you know and Bala's they always have like here by the famous like soul singers and stuff Weird Al holds a
00:13:48 high note for like a minute and a half and people thought it was loops and he's like Weird Al confirm no the high no
00:13:55 inspire but that's a real thing I did live in one take I think he sings it live every night
00:14:09 again people don't believe him that he pulled it off in one go but no Dracula dead love in it like I would advise you
00:14:14 to go and watch that one because it's just so stupid it's got I can't remember the actor's
00:14:19 name but he's in beam oh yeah he's always bit actors into out he's ones people you recognize but you don't know
00:14:24 he's now yet oh I love those actors those actors are you look at angle and know that guy I don't know his name
00:14:30 what's your favorite one of those guys those guys with no facts those guy actors for my favorites the another one
00:14:38 is 20j who does a voice in Soul Reaver you just apply to the Eldar copy his voice is so distinctive when you hear it
00:14:44 you know it's in alright I was thinking I think the only voice that's right get like that with that is John DiMaggio
00:14:50 obviously the voice of Jake the dog he's just on the same voice five six years for you guys Jake the dog and bender
00:14:55 from Futurama the same guy it's the same basic voice Wow so Finn is just running around playing up saving princesses with
00:15:04 just a alcoholic robot cool somehow makes the show back it'd be a different show we'll put it that way
00:15:12 maybe that site you know crossed over maybe you know what we've where plot you know adventures I won't be surprised oh
00:15:17 that's weird I saw one episode that where it started really knives watching random that shows
00:15:26 putting pretty great though man the veg time is good it's just you can tell they had aliens
00:15:32 oh yeah and then you know what they had good writers as well if then it got really successful and Joe it didn't now
00:15:40 police squad such a such a show you know if you think about it right how many shows can you compare a police for that
00:15:45 night Brooklyn nine-nine obviously the most direct comparison he makes they even got the deadpan delivery right I am
00:15:50 and Ray Brower who plays captain hull he's like the most direct parallel farm tonight Frank Drebin and right police
00:15:57 squad and that show so popular he got renewed I've been canceled in 24 hours he police what existed today he'd be one
00:16:04 of those shows like ABC that are canceling police squad this like amazingly funny show sounds beloved
00:16:10 actor and like written by this like oh this dream team of comedy writers it's like I bet I'd be renewed in like four
00:16:19 hours like Netflix will be on that yeah leave it released just ten years later you know the or even if it
