00:00:01 the following is a conversation with michael malus an anarchist political thinker author and a proud
00:00:10 part-time andy kaufman-like troll in the best sense of that word on both twitter and
00:00:16 in real life he's a host of a great podcast called you're welcome spelled y-o-u-r
00:00:22 i think that gives a sense of his sense of humor he is the author of dear reader the unauthorized
00:00:29 autobiography of kim jong-il and the new right a journey to the fringe of american politics
00:00:36 this latter book when i read it or rather listened to it last year helped me start learning about the
00:00:42 various disparate movements that i was undereducated about from the internet trolls to alex jones
00:00:50 to white nationalists and to techno anarchists the book is funny and brilliant and so is michael
00:00:57 unfortunately because of a self-imposed deadline i actually pulled an all-nighter before this conversation
00:01:03 so i was not exactly all there mentally even more so than usual which is tough because michael is really
00:01:09 quick-witted and brilliant but he was kind patient and understanding in this conversation
00:01:16 and i hope you will be as well today i'm trying something a little new looking to establish a regular structure
00:01:21 for these intros of first doing the guest intro like i just did
00:01:27 second quick one or two sentence mention of each sponsor third my side comments related to the episode
00:01:35 and finally fourth full ad reads on the audio side of things and on youtube going straight to the
00:01:40 conversation so not doing the full ad reads and as always no ads in the middle because to me they get in the way of the conversation
00:01:49 so quick mention of the sponsors first scm rush the most advanced seo optimization tool
00:01:54 i've ever come across i don't like looking at numbers but someone probably should
00:02:00 it helps you make good decisions second sponsor is doordash food delivery service that i've used for
00:02:05 many years to fuel long uninterrupted sessions of deep work at google mit
00:02:12 and i still use it a lot today third sponsor is masterclass online courses from the best people in the world
00:02:18 on each of the topics covered from rockets to game design to poker to writing and to guitar with carlos santana
00:02:26 please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast as a side note
00:02:31 let me say that i hope to have some conversations with political thinkers including
00:02:38 liberals and conservatives anarchists libertarians objectivists and everything in between i'm as allergic to trump bashing and trump worship
00:02:48 as you probably are i have none of that in me i really work hard to be open-minded and
00:02:54 let my curiosity drive the conversation i do plead with you to be patient on two counts first i have an intense busy life
00:03:02 outside of these podcasts like it's 4 00 am right now as i'm recording this
00:03:07 so sometimes life affects these conversations like in this case i pull on all nighter beforehand
00:03:12 so please be patient with me if i say something ineloquent confusing dumb or just plain wrong i'll try to
00:03:19 correct myself on social media or in future conversations as much as i can i really am always learning and working
00:03:25 hard to improve second if i or the guest says something about for example our current president donald trump
00:03:35 that's over the top negative or over the top positive please don't let your brain go into the
00:03:40 partisan mode try to hear our words in an open-minded nuanced way and if we say stuff from a place of
00:03:47 emotion please give us a pass nuanced conversation can only happen if we're patient with each other

00:04:09 episode where he starts mixing like sleeping pills with like pet pills and he's driving his truck and i like i
00:04:15 want to see what happens with this red there's a lineup of drugs this is gonna be so fun
00:04:28 yeah let's start with love yes yeah so one one thing we'll eventually somehow talk about it'll be a theme
00:04:34 throughout is that you're also russian yes a little bit less than me but how loud why because i'm from ukraine oh you're
00:04:41 from ukraine okay wow no because you came here a little bit when you were younger
00:04:47 yeah i i i came here when i was 13 so i saturated a little bit of the russian soul i i marinated in there so a little
00:04:53 deeper i haven't told anyone this but i'll be glad to tell you davidish i haven't been back since
00:05:00 i was two and next summer it looks like me my buddy chris williamson who's also a podcaster he's british modern wisdom
00:05:05 he looks like apollo we're we looks like we got a so we're going to go for the first time
00:05:18 to see where i came from which is ukraine we're going to go to level and either st petersburg or moscow
00:05:24 probably st petersburg or both it's going to be intense it's going to be a lot of panic attacks i feel
00:05:35 no you can't talk russian ukraine or it's like they get offended yeah but then you also want to go to russia
00:05:42 yeah i don't know for me there's several people in russia i want an interview on a podcast
00:05:49 okay so one one of them is  guerrilla promon which is a mathematician and the other person is putin you know
00:05:55 my favorite food and story is do you know this no when he had merkel with him do you know this story no
00:06:01 merkel's scared of dogs like petrified of dogs so he brings in his like like like  black lab it's a labrador
00:06:08 it's like the sweetest animal and it's all over her and there's pictures and she's sitting like this and
00:06:12 she's terrified and he's like what's wrong angela it's just completely trolling her yeah
00:06:19 he's aware of the sort of  the narrative around him yeah and then he plays with it yes he
00:06:24 enjoys it it's a very russian thing my friend wanted to film about me he goes i realize you guys aren't like us
00:06:29 at all you just like like look at us and then i started telling him stories about the upbringing
00:06:33 and he's like oh my god and as i'm telling them like wow this stuff is really crazy like what
00:06:39 how we are wired who's the we your friend is the russian the friends american i'm saying the way russians are
00:06:42 brought up and the way maybe i don't think it was just my family i bet you had similar
00:06:46 things like here's an example i i was i had a buddy staying with me he had a problem with
00:06:52 his roommate so he crashed in my place fine i went to the gym and i come back and he goes oh there was and my
00:06:59 apartment buildings has four four apartments so it's not like a huge thing he goes oh there was someone knocking at
00:07:04 your door so you know i i told him blah blah and and for me and i wonder if you're the same way
00:07:12 if i'm at someone's house that's not my own and someone knocks on the door i wouldn't even think to answer it like
00:07:18 if i had an apple here might be i'd eat it i'd cut it whatever i'm not gonna it just
00:07:22 doesn't enter my head to smash into my face the the thought of answering the door if it's not my house
00:07:27 it would never enter my head would it enter your head no but why but he's an american so someone's at the door he
00:07:32 goes and opens it even though it's not his house i would never do that i would never
00:07:36 think to do that that is so strange you pick some very obscure thing to
00:07:42 delineate americans i don't think that's obscure because i think it speaks to how we perceive strangers
00:07:48 with americans everyone's friendly and with us it's like no no like you have that moat and i think
00:07:53 that's a that percolates into many different aspects of how we relate to people and i had to
00:07:58 undo a lot of that that's true you're right there's  the relationship i formed there were in russia
00:08:04 or very deep yeah close and then there's the strangers the other that you don't trust by default it takes
00:08:10 a long time to go over the moat of trust for a long time until recently whenever i said anything to anyone my brain
00:08:19 ran a scan that said if this person turns on you would this can they use this against you
00:08:23 and i would do everything i said with strangers and after a while it's like you know what maybe they will but i'm strong
00:08:28 enough to take it but this is not how americans think well here's another one let me ask you this
00:08:32 sorry i'm taking over the interview people asked about like advice for work right like i had this
00:08:37 there was this party i went to and basically everyone had their own problems and everyone else gave their
00:08:41 advice right and someone was having a problem with the co-worker and the advice these
00:08:47 dupoy americans gave them is oh sit down and have a talk with them and to me this is like the last case last
00:08:54 resort like first you have to see what you can without showing your hand sharing your vulnerability only when
00:08:58 everything hasn't worked out or you're like all right let me sit down with you and try to have it out with you probably
00:09:03 but for them the first thing is like sit down and be like oh you're causing me problems and blah blah
00:09:08 so i perceive that right away as a threat that this person sees an antagonism between us and also as a
00:09:13 weakness that i'm getting to them so my reaction isn't how do i make it better my reaction is to reinforce
00:09:21 my position and see what i can to marginalize them usually i haven't worked in a corporate setting in a long time
00:09:27 but it's not i don't approach it the way an american would like i'm glad you came and talked to me now i probably would
00:09:32 because it's gonna be a friend so you attribute that to the russian upbringing as opposed to you have deep
00:09:38  psychological issues i think those are synonymous wait am i would you think differently
00:09:45 maybe a few years ago i don't know i i i think you lost me at the
00:09:52 because you kind of said that you're kind of implying you have a deep distrust of the world
00:09:58 like the world does i think the default but i would put it differently is i almost
00:10:10 ignore the rest of the i don't even acknowledge it i just  savor i save my love and trust for the small
00:10:18 circle of people i agree but when that person is being confrontational or as they perceive it
00:10:23 as being open now there's a situation how do you how would you handle that
00:10:30 like like a cold wind blows he's just kind of like yeah but it's not like this is an opportunity for us to work
00:10:36 out our differences it's a cold wind you're so suspicious what it really is is a cold wind
00:10:50 i'm so inhumane to be scared of it's a cold wind person but it's not this is great
00:10:56 but it's not a source of like i'm not suspicious of like i'm not  anxious i would say or
00:11:03 like living in fear of the rest of the world anymore oh i agree but you're not receptive to that person right
00:11:09 that's all i'm saying and they are got it so speaking of which let's talk about love yes which requires
00:11:15 to be receptive of the world yes of strangers i agreed
00:11:22 how do we put more love out there in the world especially on the internet one mechanism i have found to
00:11:31 increase love and that's a word that has many meanings and is you know used in a very intense sense
00:11:35 and it's used in a very loose sense can you try to define love sure love is a strong sense of attraction
00:11:45 toward a another person entity or place that causes one to tend to react in a disproportionately
00:11:54 positive manner that's off the top of my head disproportionately yes so for example if why not proportionally
00:12:01 because like if you're someone's about to who you love is about to get harmed you're moving
00:12:05 heaven and earth to make sure  or like a book you love you know like i love this book like
00:12:10 you're going through the fire to try to save it whereas if it's a book you really like
00:12:15 it's like huh i'll get another one i don't you know and a book's a kind of a loose example but
00:12:19 so you're going with the love that's like you're saving for just a few people almost like romantically like love for a
00:12:25 close family but it's also just love to even the broader like the kind of
00:12:31 love you can put out to people on the internet which is like just kindness sure i would say in that case it's
00:12:38 important to make them feel seen and validated and i try to do this when people who i
00:12:45 have come to know on the internet and there's a lot i try to do that as much as possible
00:12:49 because i don't think it's valid how on social media and i do this a lot myself but not towards everyone
00:12:57 it's just there to be aggressive and antagonistic you should be antagonistic towards bad people and that's fine
00:13:03 but at the same time there's lots of great people and especially with my audience and i would
00:13:08 bet disproportionately with yours there's a lot of people who are because of their psychology and intelligence
00:13:15 are going to be much more isolated socially than they should and if i and i've heard from many of
00:13:20 them and if i'm the person who makes them feel oh i'm not crazy it's everyone else around
00:13:25 me who is just basic  the fact that i can be that person which i didn't have at their age
00:13:32 to me is incredibly reaffirming you mean a source of love but i mean love in the sense of like
00:13:37 you know you care about this person and you want good things for them not in a kind of romantic way but i mean you're
00:13:41 using in a broad sense now yeah but you're also a person who kind of
00:13:49 i mean  attacks this power structures in the world by mocking them
00:13:57 yes effectively yes and  love i would say requires you to be non-witty and simple and fragile
00:14:06 which i see it as like the opposite of what trolls do trolls are if i if there is
00:14:15 someone coming after what i love there's two mechanisms right at least two i go up and i'm fighting them and in
00:14:21 which case you bring in if you are getting hurt and i fight even if you win the knife fight
00:14:29 or if you disarm them and you preclude the possibility of a fight and you drive them off or render them
00:14:34 powerless you can you keep your person intact as yourself and you also protect your values so how
00:14:41 do you render them powerless as you just said by mocking them one of the most effective mechanisms for those
00:14:46 in power we're much closer to brave new world than 1984. the people who are dominant
00:14:52 and in power aren't there because of the threat of you know the gulag or prison they're
00:14:56 there because of social pressures look at the masks i was on the subway not that long ago in new york city
00:15:03 no one cared who i was until i put out the mask i was in the subway that long in new york city there was and i
00:15:07 put this on my instagram i've told this story before there was an asian dude in his early 30s
00:15:11 he was like in western clothes it's not like he had a rickshaw or something an older man in
00:15:15 his 50s stood up over him on the subway screamed at him
00:15:20 said go back where you came from you're disgusting i'm going to get sick if you think this guy is a vector of
00:15:24 disease which is your prerogative why are you coming close to him why are you getting in his face
00:15:29 and what that was sorry so it was because he was asian it was both it was the not having a mask gave him the permission
00:15:39 to act like a despicable aggressive person toward him right and the point being a lot of these
00:15:46 mechanisms for social control are outsourced to low-quality people because this is their one chance to assert dominance and
00:15:53 status over somebody else so the best way to defuse that isn't with weaponry or fighting
00:15:58 it's through mockery because all of a sudden their claims to authority are effectively destroyed
00:16:03 so let me push back on that what about fighting that with with love with um
00:16:10 patience and like kindness towards them i i don't think kindness is i think that would be  a mismatch
00:16:15 and inappropriate there's superman is batman okay and superman's job is to help the good
00:16:20 people and batman's job is to hurt the bad people and i will always be on the batman side
00:16:27 than the superman side both work the silly tight costumes one has pointy ears both are ridiculous so it's
00:16:34  it was a billionaire who gets you know he's swimming in trim which one is the best batman
00:16:41 okay i'm  i'm undereducated on okay on the superhero movies i apologize okay but
00:16:47 but you're just saying you your predisposition is to be on the batman side is to  fighting
00:16:56 the bad guys yeah and that's what i'm good at that's what you're good at but just to
00:17:03 play devil's advocate or actually in this case i am the devil because that's what i usually
00:17:07 do watch the devil here the other angels advocate exactly to be the to be the angel advocate yeah
00:17:12 it's like i feel like mockery is is a as a path towards escalation of conflict
00:17:24 yes in many ways yes so you're not i mean it's kind of like guerrilla warfare it means you're not going to win i am
00:17:32 winning we're all winning we're winning on a daily this is my next book we're winning we've won before i'm
00:17:37 not joking the net the topic of the next book yes is the white pill
00:17:42 the white pill is that we're gonna we are winning the most horrible people are being
00:17:47 rendered into laughing stocks on a daily basis social media this is glorious i so disagree with you i disagree with
00:17:54 you because there's side effects that are very destructive it feels like you're winning but
00:17:59 we're completely destroying the possibility of having like a cohesive society that's
00:18:06 called oncology what's that mean curing cancer no your concept of a cohesive society
00:18:15 is in fact a society based on oppression and not allowing individuals to live their personal freedom
00:18:22 oh so your your utopian view of this you're the utopian you're saying cohesive society
00:18:26 i'm saying i don't need that i'm saying there's going to be conflict right there's going to be conflict
00:18:30 you and i are disagreeing right now that's not cohesive doesn't mean we like each other less doesn't mean we respect
00:18:34 each other less cohesive doesn't it it's just a euphemism for like everyone's submitting
00:18:39 to what i want no i mean cohesive could could  could be that it could be
00:18:47 it could be like enforced with violence all that kind of stuff sort of the  the libertarian view of the world
00:18:54 but it could just be being respectful and kind of each other and kind towards each other and loving
00:19:02 towards each other i mean that's what i mean by cohesive so when people say free
00:19:08 it's it's funny like freedom is a funny thing because freedom can be painful to a lot of people
00:19:17 it's it's all matters how you define it how you implement it how it actually looks like
00:19:24 sure and i'm just saying it feels like the mockery of the powerful leads to further and further the
00:19:32 divisions it's like it's turning life into a game to where it's always you're playing
00:19:40 you you're creating these different little tribes and groups and you're constantly
00:19:48  fighting the groups that become a little bit more powerful by undercutting them through guerrilla
00:19:53 warfare kind of thing and that's what the internet becomes is everyone's just mocking each other
00:19:58 and then certain groups become more and more powerful and then they start fighting each other and into
00:20:03 basic they they form groups of ideologies and they start fighting each other in the internet
00:20:12 where the result is it doesn't feel like the common humanity is highlighted it doesn't feel like
00:20:19 that's a path of progress now like when i say cohesive i don't mean like
00:20:25 everybody has to be you know enforcing equality all those kinds of ideas i just mean like not being so divisive
00:20:32 that's like so it's going back to the original question of like how do we put more love out in the world
00:20:38 than the internet i i want divisiveness oh you see you think that this is that's that goal it's very
00:20:42 interesting it's the goal so you we started this conversation with you talking about you have love for that
00:20:47 small group  i think we both would agree to have a bigger group be better especially if
00:20:53 that love comes from a sincere place i think our country specific i wrote an article about this four years ago
00:20:58 that it's time to disunite the states and to secede this country has been held together with at
00:21:04 least two separate cultures with thumbtacks and string for over 20 years  there's an enormous amount of contempt
00:21:10 from one group toward another this contempt comes from sincere place they do not share each other's values
00:21:16 there's absolutely no reason just like any unhealthy relationship where you can't say you know what it's
00:21:20 not working out i want to go my own way and live my happiness and i genuinely want you to go your way
00:21:27 live your happiness if i'm wrong prove me wrong i'll learn from you and and take lessons
00:21:31 and vice versa but the fact that we all have to be in the same house together is not coherent
00:21:37 and that's not love that is the path towards friction and tension especially do you think there's
00:21:44 concrete groups like is it as simple as the two groups of blue and red no it's it's it's it's also very fluid
00:21:51 because you and i are allied as jewish people as russians as males
00:21:57 as podcasters  you're an academic i'm not there so there's there we're different but we each are a
00:22:02 venn diagram even within ourselves and i can talk to you about politics and then we can talk
00:22:09 about russia stuff and then you could talk about your your work which i don't know
00:22:12 anything about so that would be where you're way up here in our way down here so there's lots every relationship with
00:22:17 just between individuals there's it's very dynamic so how do we succeed like how do we form individual states
00:22:25 sure there's a little bit more cohesion sure the and voluntary cohesion so the first step is to
00:22:32  eliminate and the concept of political authority as legitimate and to  denigrate and humiliate those
00:22:40 who would put themselves in a position in which they are there to tell you how to live your life
00:22:45 from any semblance of validity and that's starting to happen if you look at what they had with the
00:22:52 lockdowns cuomo and de blasio new york  we have i was  tired a couple weeks ago and i said to my friend oh just click
00:22:58 maybe i've covered and he goes it's not possible like what do you mean and he goes we haven't had any deaths in
00:23:04 like two months and there's only 100 cases a day for like two months and i go
00:23:09 you're exaggerating because everything was still closed and i looked at the numbers and he wasn't exaggerating
00:23:15 and there's no greater american dream to me than an immigrant family comes to the states forms their own little business
00:23:22 maybe mom's a good cook it's a restaurant dry cleaner fruit stand and those people aren't going to have a
00:23:28 lot of money those are the first ones who lost their companies because of these lockdowns
00:23:34 they cuomo who's the governor of new york opened up the gyms he said you're clear to open up
00:23:39 de blasio said and we don't have enough inspectors you're gonna have to wait another couple of weeks
00:23:44  to regard that as anything other than literally criminal is something that i am having a hard and
00:23:49 harder time wrapping my head around you said i mean that's something i'm deeply worried
00:23:54 about as well which is like thousands it's actually millions of dreams being crushed that amer
00:24:02 american dream of starting a business of running a business what about all the young people who you
00:24:07 and i have in our audiences who are socially isolated at best and now they can't leave their homes
00:24:14  isolation and ostracism are things that are very well studied in psychology these have extreme consequences i read a
00:24:21 book called ostracism and this wasn't scientific but basically the author was a psychiatrist at college whatever
00:24:26 and he had one of his colleagues they did an experiment let's for a week you ostracized me completely we know
00:24:31 it's an and he goes even knowing it's the experiment the fact that he wouldn't make eye contact
00:24:36 with me and the fact that he ignored me had an extreme emotional impact on me knowing full well this is purely for
00:24:44 experimental purposes now you multiply that by all these p the suicide the number of kids were
00:24:48 thinking about suicide was through the roof during all this  and my point is until these people
00:24:55 it's gonna i would predict like 2024 that's where we're going to have to start having conversations about what
00:24:59 personal consequences have to be done for these people because until then they're going to do the same thing
00:25:04 so you think there's going to be society-wide consequences of this that we're going to see like ripple effects
00:25:11 because of the social isolation i i know i mean we also need to talk about consequences or cuomo de blasio
00:25:16 because if politicians respond to incentives and the incentives are there for them to be extremely conservative
00:25:22 because if you have to choose as cuomo said a press conference between a thousand people dying and a thousand
00:25:26 people losing their business it's not a hard choice and he's right but at a certain point it's like all
00:25:31 right you're losing both you're losing not losing the you're making these decisions
00:25:36 and not having consequences for it and you're going to do it again the next time so we need to make sure you're you're a
00:25:41 little scared okay and i don't know what that would mean but you're laying this
00:25:49 problem this this incompetence i don't think it's incompetence i think it's very competent
00:25:54 i think they're just they're jobs yes but what but you're laying it not at the the hands of the individuals but the
00:26:00 structure of the of government it's both yes how would we deal with it better without
00:26:07 centralized control well we didn't really have centralized control because every country and every
00:26:12 state you know handled it in a different mechanism but a city has centralized control just yeah
00:26:17 right i mean no that's not true so cuomo de blasio they had a lot of disagreements over this
00:26:21 over the months and this was actually a source of great interest and tension de blasio wanted at one point was
00:26:26 talking about like quarantining people in their homes home was like you're crazy  something
00:26:31 same thing with the schools same thing with the gyms and there are other such  examples
00:26:36 but the point being this was an emergency this is world war one i talked about some timpool show was
00:26:43 very dangerous because it gave a lot of evil people some very useful information about what
00:26:49 the country put up with and what they can get away with under wartime and this set the model for
00:26:54 things like the new deal and the other things of that nature it is undeniable you're a scientist so
00:26:59 you understand this perfectly well that this lockdown gave some very nefarious people
00:27:06 some very valid data about how much people will put up with  under  pressures from the state
00:27:14 so fundamentally what is the problem okay well but but   to play angel's advocate again
00:27:27 you know government is the people so come on you don't you you you're do you do you really think this
00:27:33 at as best i think it's possible to have represent representation can you imagine if you have an attorney
00:27:37 you're like oh you can't have the attorney you want you're gonna have this guy who you absolutely hate who you
00:27:42 share no values with why because he drives i mean leaders political leaders and
00:27:47 political representation drive the discourse like we you know  the majority of people voted for him
00:27:52 or whatever however however he defined that and now we get to have a discussion well
00:28:01 was this the right choice and then we get to make that choice again in four years and so on
00:28:05 first of all the fact that i have to be under the thumb of somebody four years makes no sense there's no other
00:28:10 relationship that's like this including a marriage you can leave any other relationship at
00:28:15 any time number one number two is it always impeach but they did that part of it i'm
00:28:20 in just saying yeah that there's yeah the mechanisms are  flawed in many ways yeah yeah
00:28:25 right and and so that's number one number two is it doesn't make sense
00:28:31 that if i don't want someone to represent me that because that person is popular that
00:28:37 they are now in a position to so having  representation and and having citizenship based on
00:28:44 geography is a pre line technology in a post-cell phone world there's no reason why
00:28:49 i have to just because we're physically in between two oceans we all have to be represented by the
00:28:53 same people whereas i can very easily have my security be under someone and switch it as easily as cell phone
00:29:00 providers so okay but it doesn't have to be geographical it can be ideas sure i mean this country represents a
00:29:05 certain set of ideas yes it does it started out geographically it still it was just it started off as
00:29:11 ideas as well but like there's a it's it was intricately i mean that's the way humans are there's
00:29:17 i mean there was no internet so it was you were geographically in the same location and you signed a bunch of
00:29:22 documents and then you kind of debated and you wrote a bunch of stuff and then you
00:29:26 agreed on it okay so you understand that no one signed these documents and no one agreed
00:29:30 to it as lysandra spooner pointed out over 150 years ago
00:29:35 the constitution or the social contract if anything is only binding to the signatories and
00:29:41 even then they're all long dead  so it's it's this fallacy that somehow because i'm in a physical place
00:29:47 i have agreed even though i'm screaming to you a face that i don't agree to be subordinate to  some
00:29:54 imaginary invisible monster that was created 250 years ago and this idea of like if you don't like
00:29:59 it you have to move that's not what freedom means freedom means i do what i want not what
00:30:03 you want so if you don't like it you move okay just to put some i don't like words
00:30:09 and terms one one one zero one one one zero yeah exactly is that what your language is it is
00:30:14 i'm translating it all in real time but  would you call the kind of ideas that  you're advocating for and we're
00:30:23 talking about anarchy yes anarchism yes okay so let's get into it can you can you try to
00:30:30 paint the utopia that an anarchist worldview dreams about the only people who describe anarchism
00:30:37 as utopia are its critics if i told you right now and i wish i could say this factually that i have a
00:30:42 cure for cancer that would not make us a utopia that would still probably be expensive
00:30:48 we would still have many other diseases however we would be fundamentally healthier happier and better off all
00:30:56 of us than democracy so that democracy sorry i jump back from the cancer no that democracy or
00:31:03 government so it's only curing one major major life-threatening problem but in no sense is it a utopia so what can we try to 
00:31:13 answer this question same question many times which is what exactly is the problem with
00:31:18 democracy the problem with democracy is that those who need leaders are not qualified to choose them
00:31:26 those who need leaders are not qualified to choose them so that's the central problem of democracy not all of us need leaders
00:31:32 right what does it mean to need a leader are you saying like people who are
00:31:42 actually like free thinkers don't need leaders kind of thing sure that's but like take a wave but
00:31:47 like you don't okay so do you acknowledge that there's some value in authority
00:31:56 in different subjects so what what that means is i don't mean an authority somebody who's in control of you
00:32:04 but you're doing the definition switch because i am i am you're right you're right it's unfair okay those those bad
00:32:09 but that's what they do that's their trick yeah and it's this is one of the useful things by the way less is total sidebar
00:32:15 if people ask me for advice i always tell them if you're going to raise your kids raise them bilingual
00:32:20 because i was trilingual by the time i was six and that teaches you to think in concepts whereas if you only know one language
00:32:26 you fall for things like this because using authority in the sense of a policeman and someone is an authority in physics
00:32:32 it's the same word conceptually they're extremely different but if you're only thinking in one
00:32:37 language your brain is going to equate the two and that's a trap that people who only speak one language have
00:32:42 for sure but even if you know multiple languages you can still use the trick of using your c or convenience
00:32:47 yeah absolutely to manipulate the conversation you weren't trying to do that but you
00:32:51 you fell in i accidentally did it yeah right we all tend to do that if you only speak one language and think of one language
00:32:58 but if i guess let me rephrase it i are you against do you acknowledge the value of like offloading your own
00:33:08 effort about a particular thing to somebody else absolutely like an accountant a lawyer a doctor
00:33:15 absolute a chef infinite isn't that ultimately what a democracy is broadly defined like
00:33:22 you're basically electing a bunch of authorities using the word you in two senses using the word you meaning me as an
00:33:29 individual now using you as a mass yes as a math not use an individual so i have i would absolutely want someone to
00:33:35 provide for my security i would absolutely want someone to negotiate with me for foreign power or something
00:33:39 like that that does not mean it has to be predicated and what lots of other people
00:33:45 who i do not know and if i do know them probably would not respect think about it's of no moral relevance
00:33:51 to me nor eye to them so do you think this kind of there could be
00:33:58 a bunch of humans that behave kind of like ants in a distributed way there could be an emergent behavior in them that
00:34:07 results in a stable society like isn't that the hope with anarchy is like without an overarching  but answer
00:34:15 i i mean answer the worst example here because ants have a very firm authority the queen yeah and they're all they're
00:34:21 all drones they're all clones of each other yeah but so if you forget the queen their behavior they're all
00:34:29 well from your perspective from your human intelligence perspective but from their perspective they'll probably see
00:34:33 each other as a bunch of individuals no they don't ants are very big on altruism in the
00:34:42 they do not think the individual matters they routinely kill themselves for the sake of the hive
00:34:47 in the community but they see that's from the outside perspective from the individual perspective of the
00:34:53 individual they probably they they don't see it as altruism right but they they view and they're
00:35:01 right because the aunt's life is very ephemeral and cheap that it's more important to continue this
00:35:07 mass population that that one individual ant live like bees are another even better
00:35:11 example the honey bee when they sting they only sting once and they die and they do it
00:35:15 gladly because it's like okay this community is much more important than me and they're right
00:35:22 yeah okay so fine let's forget i'm being pedantic but it's important i think i'm not just being for the sake of being fed but
00:35:28 there's something beautiful that i won't argue about because i do there's an interesting point there about
00:35:33 individualism of ants i do think they're more individual but like
00:35:38 let's let's give your view of ants that they're it's their communists okay let's go with the communist view of ants
00:35:44 okay yeah  but there's still a beautiful emergent thing which is like
00:35:52 they can function as a as a society and so is that the hope for anarchy it's like you just throw a bunch of people
00:36:04 that voluntarily want to be in the same place under the same set of ideas and they kind of like
00:36:11 the doctors emerge the police officers emerge the  the different necessary structures of a functional society emerge
00:36:18 do you know what the most beautiful example of anarchism is that is just beyond beautiful when you
00:36:24 stop to think about it i'm not being tongue-in-cheek language there's infinite languages language the
00:36:33 things that language can be used for are bring tears to people's eyes quite literally it's also used for basic things no one
00:36:40 is forcing us we speak two languages each at least no one's forcing us to use english
00:36:46 no one's forcing us to use this dialect of english  it's a way and and despite there being
00:36:52 so many different languages  lingua franca emerge you know people the language that everyone is in latin
00:36:58 even in north korea they refer to the fish and the different animals by the latin scientific  no one decided this sure
00:37:05 there's an organization that sets a binomial nomenclature but there's no gun to anyone's head
00:37:12 referring to  seamoth as a pegasus species and when you think about how amazing language is
00:37:18 and someone other context would say like well you you need to have a world government and they're deciding which is the verbs
00:37:24 and you have to have an official definition and an official dictionary and none of that happened
00:37:30 and i think anyone even if they don't agree with my politics or my worldview cannot deny that the creation of
00:37:36 language is one of humanity's most miraculous beautiful achievements
00:37:42 absolutely so there there you go there's one system where a kind of anarchy can result in
00:37:50 in beauty stability like sufficient stability and yet dynamic flexibility to adjust it and so on
00:37:58 and the internet helps it you get some something like urban dictionary which which starts creating absurd both humor and
00:38:06 wit but also language and syntax and jargon immediately you size people up if you use if you say vertebral i know
00:38:12 you're a doctor because that's how they pronounce it the the spinal column  i'm sure in your field there's
00:38:17 certain jargon right away you can know if this person's one of us or not i mean it's infinite i mean i don't need
00:38:23 to tell you and it's emojis too yes there's so much there to study with language it's fascinating but
00:38:29 do you think this applies to human life the the meat space the physical space yes so these there's that kind of beauty can
00:38:37 emerge without  without writing stuff on paper without laws you could have rules you
00:38:41 don't need you don't have to be laws so enforced by violence like that's what what's a law a law is
00:38:49 something that is unchosen a rule is something if i go to my pool and i i sign up to remember a pool
00:38:56 on the wall lists certain things it's like you know certain number of people in the pool
00:39:00 no peeing in here good luck enforcing that one and so on and so forth well that's the problem
00:39:05 aren't you afraid that people are gonna pee in the pool that's not as my biggest concern is mass incarceration
00:39:12 as the fact that the police can steal more money than burglars can the fact that innocent people can be
00:39:18 killed with no consequences the fact that war can be waged and with no  consequences for those who waged it
00:39:25 the fact that so many men and women are being murdered overseas and here and the people who are
00:39:30 guiding these are regarded as heroic so you think there might that in an anarchist system
00:39:37 there's a possibility of have of having less wars and less what would you say corruption and  less abuse of power let's talk
00:39:47 yes and let's talk about corruption because and i made this point on rogan you and i
00:39:52 again this the russian background we realize that when it comes to corruption american is very naive
00:39:58 corruption they think is oh i got my brother a job and he's getting money on the table
00:40:02 that's not when we're talking about like state corruption things that are done in totalitarian
00:40:06 states and even to some extent in america like jeffrey epstein julian maxwell things that stalin did things that
00:40:12 hitler did you know when the cia was torturing people at gitmo they had to borrow kgb manuals because
00:40:17 they didn't know how to torture correctly because they never thought of these things
00:40:22 we it's very hard for us to get into the mindset of someone who's like a child predator someone who  let me give you an
00:40:28 example from my forthcoming book there was a guy who was the head of ukraine in the 30s i forget his name now these
00:40:34 old soviets they were tough i mean they pride stalin means steel you know they pride themselves in their cruelty
00:40:40 and how strong they were and this was the purge you know stalin is trying to you know killing lots of people left and right
00:40:48 and his henchman beria had the quote  find me the man i'll find you the crime you know they would accuse someone
00:40:52 and they would torture him until he talked and confessed and then he had to turn people in
00:40:58 and they took this guy in like beginning the year i think it's 36 38 he was had ukraine by may he's arrested and they take him
00:41:04 to the le blanca the basement in the red square where they're torturing people and they put they did the works on him
00:41:10 and he was a good soviet he stood up and he who knows what they did to him he didn't talk
00:41:16 so they said okay one moment they brought his teenage daughter in raped her in front of him he talked so
00:41:24 when we talk about corruption we would never in a million years think of this that's not how our minds work
00:41:31 so when you're talking about states and people where you don't have ease of exit
00:41:37 where you are forced to be under the auspices of an organization creating a monopoly that leads to
00:41:45 in extreme cases but in not as extreme cases really  nefarious outcomes whereas if you have the option to leave as a
00:41:54 client or customer that would have a strongly limiting effect on  how a business and what it can get
00:42:01 away with so but don't you think maybe i don't know who the right example is whether it's stalin
00:42:07 i think hitler might be the better example of don't you think or jeffrey epstein perhaps
00:42:16 don't you think people who are evil will will find ways to manipulate human nature to attain power no matter the system
00:42:27 yes and like the the corollary question is do you think those people can get more power in in the democracy in a you know
00:42:37 in when there's a government already in place they can it's easily they get more power more dangerous they have a
00:42:40 government place first of all sociopaths are known for their charm and for their
00:42:47 warmth here's the two situations in in a free society i'm a sociopath i'm an evil person
00:42:53 i'm the head of macy's in a state society i'm an evil person i'm a sociopath i'm the head of the us government
00:42:58 which of these are you more concerned with it's like night and day so you would have far more decentralized
00:43:03 military you would have far more decentralized security forces and they would be much more subject to feedback from the market
00:43:14 if you have an issue with macy's or any store with a sweater look at that transaction if you have an
00:43:20 issue with the state to you hiring a lawyer costs more than a surgeon to even
00:43:25 access the mechanism for dispute is going to be exorbitant and price poor people out of the market for um
00:43:31 conflict resolution immediately so right away you have something that's extremely regressive and even though this is
00:43:37 touted as some great equalizer it's quite the opposite so in current society there's a deep
00:43:42 suspicion of governments and states they're not that's not really like just your example of macy's i mean
00:43:49 don't you think a hitler could rise to be at the top of a social network like twitter and
00:43:54 facebook okay let's suppose hitler ran twitter okay let's take this thought experiment seriously literally what could he do so all the
00:44:01 only tweets are gonna be about how much the jews suck right okay fine okay all the cool people
00:44:07 are leaving there could be some compelling like you said evil people are charming there could
00:44:14 be some compelling narratives that could be with conspiracy theories  untruths that could be spread
00:44:23 like propaganda every criticism of anarchism is in fact a description well the strongest criticisms of anarchism are in
00:44:29 fact description of the status quo your concern is under anarchism propaganda would spread and people would
00:44:36 be taught the wrong ideas unlike the status quo that's not even a criticism of anarchism
00:44:41 i'm not actually criticizing it's an open question of in which system will human nature thrive be
00:44:55 be able to thrive more and in in which system would the evils that arise in human nature would be more
00:45:01 easily suppressable there that's that's the question it's a scientific experiment and i'm asking
00:45:07 only from our perspective of the fact that we've tried democracy quite a bit recently and we i don't
00:45:15 maybe you can correct me we haven't yet seriously tried anarchy in a large scale well we don't need to try to
00:45:21 so anarchy isn't like a country right it's like it's you can't i'm not it's like saying well if anarchy
00:45:25 works how can we've never had an anarchist government right so anarchism is a relationship and
00:45:31 language is an example of this it's a worldwide and our system you and i have an anarchist relationship there's almost no
00:45:36 circumstances we'd be calling the police on each other i mean it's i'm asking the same question in
00:45:42 a bunch of different directions out of born out of my curiosity is why is anarchy going to be
00:45:51 better at preventing the darker sides of human nature which presumably your criticism of government
00:45:55 because it's this because of decentralization so the darker side of human nature is an extreme concern
00:46:02 anyone who says it's going to go away is absurd and fallacious i think that's a non-starter when people say that
00:46:07 everyone's going to be good human beings are basically animals we're capable of great beauty and kindness we're capable of
00:46:13 just complete cruel and what we would call inhumanity but we see it on a daily basis even today
00:46:19  and what's interesting is the corporate press won't even tell you the darkest aspects
00:46:25 because that's too upsetting to people so they'll tell you about atrocities and horrors but only to a point
00:46:30 and then when you actually do the homework you're like oh it's so much worse than
00:46:34 like that thing about stalin right so we know in a broad sense that stalin was a dictator we know
00:46:41 that he killed a lot of people but it takes work to learn about the hall of demore it
00:46:45 takes work to learn about what those literal tortures were and that this is the person who later
00:46:51 fdr and harry truman were shaking hands with and taking photos with and was being sold to us as uncle joe you
00:46:57 know he's just like you and me so when you have a decentralized information network as opposed to having three
00:47:07 media networks it is a lot easier for information that doesn't fit what would be the corporate america narrative
00:47:14 to reach  the populations and it would be more effective for democracy because they're in a much
00:47:19 better position to be informed now you're right it also means well if everyone has a mic that means every
00:47:23 crazy person and with their wacky views and at a certain point yeah it has to become
00:47:29 then there's another level which is then the people have to be self-enforcing and and you see that on social media all
00:47:34 the time when someone says this the other person jumps in you think but isn't social media a good
00:47:40 example of this like so you think ultimately without centralized control
00:47:48 you can have stability like what about the mob outrage and the mob rule the
00:47:54 the power of the mobs that that emerge power of the mob is is a very  serious concern  gustav labon
00:48:01 wrote a book in the 1890s called the crowd and this was one of the most important books i've written because it
00:48:04 influenced both mussolini and hitler and stalin and they all talked about it and he made the point
00:48:11 that under crowd psychology human lynching is another example this none of those individuals or very few
00:48:16 would ever dream of doing these acts but when they're all together
00:48:22 and you lose that sense of self you become the ant and you lose that sense of individually
00:48:28 you're capable of doing things that like in another context you'd be like i should kill myself i'm a monster so
00:48:34 you're worried about that but like is in the mob doesn't the mob have more power under anarchy
00:48:39 no the mob has much less power on anarchy because under anarchism every individual is fully empowered you wouldn't have  um
00:48:48  gun restrictions you would have people creating communities based on shared values
00:48:53 they would be much more collegial they'd be much more kind as opposed to when you're forcing people
00:48:59 to be together in a polity when they don't have things in common that is again like having a bad roommate
00:49:06 if you're forced to look at jails if you're forced to be in locked in a room with someone even if
00:49:11 you at first like them after a while you're going to start to hate them and that leads to very
00:49:16 nefarious consequences so as an anarchist what do you do in a society like this
00:49:23 thrive i think i'm doing okay i mean i mean there's an election coming up there's  as as you talk
00:49:38  you're welcome is one of the it's you talk about libertarianism a little
00:49:52 bit yeah i mean political direction like in terms of we as a society should
00:50:02 should go i don't mean we as a nation i mean we as a collective of people should go to  to make a better world from an
00:50:09 anarchist point of view sure  i think politics is the enemy  and anything i need to find politics
00:50:19 so anything that lessens its sway on people anything that delegitimizes it is good i wrote an article a few years ago about
00:50:27 how wonderful it is that trump is regarded as such a buffoon because it's very very useful
00:50:33 to have a commander-in-chief who's regarded as a clown because it's going to take a lot to get
00:50:39 him to convince your kids to go overseas and start killing people and making widows and orphans
00:50:43 as well as those kids coming home in caskets whereas if someone is regarded with prestige
00:50:48 and they're like oh we need to send your kid overseas oh absolutely i mean this guy's great so that is a
00:50:54 very healthy thing where people are skeptical of the state but there's a lot of people
00:51:02 that  regard him as as one of the greatest leaders we've ever had yeah
00:51:08 dinesh d'souza he's another lincoln i when you talk about trump or talk about biden
00:51:16 i think i'm trying to find a line to walk where you they don't immediately put you into the
00:51:21 this person has trump derangement syndrome or they have the other the alternative to that i i'm
00:51:27 more than happy when people are preemptively dismissing me because then i don't have to waste
00:51:31 time engaging with them because those people will be of no use to me when i was on tim pool recently tim
00:51:37 poole's show  tim poole's known for his little like hat i got a propeller beanie
00:51:41 motorized and it was just spinning the whole two hours like the 1950s thing the point being i wore it
00:51:47 because there's lots of people who would say i can't take seriously someone who wears a hat like that
00:51:52 and my point being if you are the kind of person who takes your cues based on someone's wardrobe as opposed
00:51:58 to the content of your ideas you're of no use to me as an ally so i'd be more than happy you preemptively
00:52:05 abort rather than waste our breath this is the deep this is a very very deep thing that you and i
00:52:10 disagree on which is this is goes to the trolling versus the love is i believe that person instinctually
00:52:18 dismisses you on the very basic surface level yes but deep down
00:52:26 there actually there's a wealth of a human being that seeks the connection to seeks to understand
00:52:34 deeply to connect with other humans that we should speak to i think you and i completely disagree see
00:52:40 you're saying i'm saying there's no mind there literally okay so let's i naturally i think that majority
00:52:47 so i naturally think the majority of people are have the capacity to be thoughtful
00:52:57 intelligent and you know learn about ideas ideas that they instinctually based on their own likes
00:53:07 current inner circle disagree with and learn to understand to empathize with the other like i and
00:53:12 in the current climate there's a divisiveness that discourages that and
00:53:19 that's where i see the value of love of of encouraging people to to  to strip away that surface instinctual
00:53:28 response based on the thing they've been taught based on the things they listen to to actually think deeply
00:53:35 have you ever had  gone to cvs or dwayne reed and your bill how much you owe them is
00:53:40 six dollars and you give them a ten dollar bill in a single and watch the look on their face
00:53:45 you watch them void their bowels and panic because you give them eleven dollars on a six dollar bill
00:53:52 this is not a mind capable or interested in thoughts and ideas learning no you're talking about the first moment
00:53:58 of  a for a first moment where there's an opportunity to think
00:54:05 they are desperate to avoid it no they're just it's and incapable of it i just it's  they're they have these
00:54:12 same exact experiences i have every single day when i know it's time for me to go on on
00:54:17 a run of five miles or six miles or ten miles i'm desperate to avoid it
00:54:25 and at the same time i know i have the capacity to do it and i'm deeply fulfilled when i do do it
00:54:30 when i do overcome that challenge you are one of the great minds of our generation you are telling me that any
00:54:35 of these people can do anything close to the work you do not in artificial intelligence but
00:54:45 in in inability to be compassionate towards other people's ideas like understand them enough to be able
00:54:52 passion requires a certain baseline of intelligence because you have to perceive other people as being different but of value
00:54:57 yeah exactly that's a sophisticated mindset i think i think most people are are capable of it you don't think so no
00:55:06 and nor are they interested in it but in that kind of if you don't believe they're capable of it how can anarchy be stable
00:55:16  if you have a farm there's one farmer and 50 cows it's very stable you're just not you're
00:55:21 not asking the cows where to force or where to farm things yeah but the cows aren't intelligent
00:55:29 enough to do damage cows cows certainly bulls because they could do a lot of damage they could
00:55:34 trample things they could attack you the cows are like how much they weigh like four thousand pounds can you
00:55:39 connect the analogy then because like sure you can't expect yeah saying a cow is a cow
00:55:45 isn't a slur it's not saying you hate cows cows or even let's say the example i always use with good
00:55:50 reason is dogs okay  i always say to study how human beings operate watch caesar milan
00:55:56 because human beings and dogs have co-evolved our minds have both evolved in parallel tracks to
00:56:02 communicate with each other dogs are can be vicious dogs for the most part are great
00:56:08 wonderful but you can't expect the dog to understand certain concepts it's not an ins and out most people are offended
00:56:13 are you saying like a dog if you're a dog person like i am this is actually a huge compliment most dogs are
00:56:18 better than most people but to get the idea that this is something that is basically your peer
00:56:27 is nonsensical now of course this sounds arrogant and elitist and so on and so forth and i'm perfectly happy with that but it
00:56:32 is very hard to persuade me or anyone that if you walk george carlin has that joke think
00:56:37 how smart the average person is then realize 50 of people are dumber than that if you
00:56:42 walk around and see who's out there these people are very kind they are of value they they deserve to
00:56:46 be treated with respect they deserve to be secure in their person they deserve to feel
00:56:53 safe and to have love but the expectation that they should have any sort of semblance of power over
00:57:01 me in my life is as nonsensical as asking lassie to be my accountant so but that goes to power that not to 
00:57:10 the ability the capacity to be empathetic compassionate intelligent what if i were to try to prove you wrong
00:57:18 that's a good question okay what would what would what would you be impressed by about society
00:57:25 well how would i show it to you that's a good question how would you show it to me because i think something has to be
00:57:29 falsifiable if you're going to make a claim right so what would it what would it
00:57:36 because we both made claims that are a kind of our own like interpretation based on our interaction
00:57:43 like when i open twitter everyone seems to say why do you only follow one person who do you follow
00:57:47 who's the one person you follow  stoic emperor i i follow a lot of people i this is real love it's not ironic love i love
00:58:04 watching it and i'm sure you do too i love watching a quality mind at work because when someone has a quality of
00:58:10 mind they're often not self-aware i catch this on myself of how it operates and then when other
00:58:14 people see it they're like oh my god this is so beautiful because there's such an innocence to it
00:58:19 yeah but like when i open twitter i'm energized there's a lot of love on twitter people say like
00:58:25 i love to i agree i have you don't think i have a lot of love on twitter my fans pay my rent i mean i don't know your
00:58:33 experience of twitter but when i look at your which is a fundamentally different thing i'm saying my experience from the so
00:58:38 maybe you can tell me what your experience is like as a human so when i observe your twitter i
00:58:46 think i i wouldn't call it love i would call it fun yes and because of that
00:58:55 that's a different kind of like love emerges from that because people kind of learn that we're
00:59:01 having this is like game night like yes  you know we're we can talk a little bit we can  and you can
00:59:10 you can even like pull in you can make fun of people you can have the crazy uncle come over that
00:59:17 is a huge trump supporter somebody who hates trump and you can have a little fun yes i get it's a different kind of thing
00:59:22 i i wouldn't be able to  be the you're the host of game night yes yes so i wouldn't be
00:59:31 able to host that kind of game you night your robots and you're asking what is fun and it just starts sparkling
00:59:38 exactly what is fun so the robots in my life that survive are the ones that
00:59:47 that don't that like survive that whole programming  process so they're kind of like
00:59:52 they're kind of like the idiot from dostoevsky they're very like simple-minded robots it's just one is moving a can
01:00:00 from one table to another yeah that's game night for  for our kin you know what my quotes is and i i i
01:00:06 think about this every day and i mean it with every fiber of my being  we are born knowing that life is a magical adventure
01:00:12 and it takes them years to train us to think otherwise and i think that willy wonka approach it's a
01:00:17 very camu approach it's something i believe with every fiber of my being i try to spread that
01:00:22 as much as possible i think it is very sad i'm not being sarcastic i this
01:00:27 it comes off as condescending i mean it at face value it's very sad how many people are not receptive to that
01:00:32 and i think a lot of those functions how they were raised and i i could have very easily with my
01:00:38 upbringing have not maintained that perspective and there's a lot of
01:00:44 i have a lot of friends in recovery like aa and they have an expression not my circus not my monkeys right
01:00:50 that you can't really take on other people's problems on your own at a certain point they have to do the work
01:00:55 themselves because you can only do so much externally and there are a lot of very damaged
01:01:00 people out there and there are damaged people who revel in being damaged
01:01:05 and they are damaged people who desperately desperately desperately want to be well
01:01:10 who desperately want to be happy who desperately want to find joy so if i can be the one and as arrogant
01:01:16 as it sounds i'll own it who does give them that fun and to tell them it doesn't have to be like you you thought
01:01:23 like it could be it's going to hurt it's gonna suck but it's still a magical adventure and
01:01:27 you're gonna be okay because you've been through worse like that if that could be my message i
01:01:32 would own it all day long and so what does adventure look like for you because i mean it actually boils
01:01:38 down to i still disagree with you i think trolling can can be and very often as destructive for
01:01:44 society you yes i want to destroy society that is the goal
01:01:50 i want i want to help many people what do i do with that okay so whatever you want do what that will
01:02:00 is the hall of the law like i just wanna so you're hosting game night and i just wanna play monopoly i wanna play 
01:02:08 what's the risk okay i want to play these games and you're saying lots of games yeah i was trying to think like of a
01:02:13 friendlier game but they're all kind of aggressive  battleship access and allies you know fun stuff
01:02:24 but like  so that's an adventure but you're saying that we want to destroy everything even like
01:02:31 the rules of those games are are not like you voluntarily agree to those rules the point is
01:02:35 if someone comes in who's not who no one invited to game night and are telling you no when you play
01:02:41 monopoly you have to get money when you land in free parking or you don't yeah it's like who are you
01:02:46 yeah we're having our own fun and you smell i don't know but there's there's a an aggressive there's an aggression let me let me
01:02:54 speak to that which i think you're picking up on  i had a friend named martha marcia
01:02:59 excuse me she ran something called cuddle parties which people laughed at about a lot
01:03:02 back in the day and the premise of the cuddle parties everyone got together and cuddled right and it's like ah
01:03:06 then you stop to think about and you realize  physical contact is extremely important and a lot of people don't have it and if
01:03:12 this is a mechanism of people getting that it actually is going to have profound positive psychological
01:03:16 consequences so after she explained it i'm like okay we laughed at this because it's weird
01:03:19 and now that i think about this is wonderful and and i asked her about like like the tough question i go
01:03:26 what if guys get turned on and on their website it even has a rule like do not fear the erection right because it's
01:03:30 going to be a natural consequence of physical proximity and the point she goes she said this i think about us all
01:03:34 the time people will take as much space as you let them it is incumbent on each of us
01:03:43 to set our own boundaries we all have to learn when to say no you're making me uncomfortable if someone doesn't respect your right to
01:03:50 have your boundary to be uncomfortable this person is not your friend now they can say i don't understand like why
01:03:56 is this okay why is that not i let me know you better so i'm respectful of you but if they roll their eyes and
01:04:01 they're like get over i'm gonna do what i want this person is not interested in knowing
01:04:08 okay that is the aggression it is you have to draw those lines i mean but that's a very positive way of
01:04:14 phrasing that aggression i'm a very positive person but the trolling there's a destructive thing to it yes
01:04:21 that hurts others yes but it's not bad people oh i only troll as a reaction or towards
01:04:28 those in power okay so maybe let's talk about trolling a little bit because
01:04:35 trolling when it can maybe you can correct me but i've seen it become a game for
01:04:39 people that's enjoyable in itself i i'm not i'm not i i disagree with that
01:04:45 but that's not a good thing if you are there just to hurt innocent people you are a horrible human being but
01:04:52 doesn't trolling too easily become that  i don't know about easily let me give you an example
01:04:56 of the the where trolling came from the original troll was andy kaufman
01:05:03 he was on the show taxi he was a stan he was a performance artist not a standard comedian and this is a quintessential example of
01:05:09 trolling he had a character where he was basically like a lounge singer he had these glasses on
01:05:14 and just a terrible terrible singer and so on and so forth and he denied it was him and he came out and i'm blanking on the
01:05:21 guy's name i can't believe it tony clifton yeah he came out in the audience and he goes you know
01:05:28 my wife died a few years ago every time i look at my daughter sarah's eyes i could see my wife sarah come out here
01:05:32 let's do a duet and sarah's like 11. sits on his lap they start singing duet
01:05:38 her voice cracks he smacks her across the face what the hell are you doing you're making ass in front of these
01:05:43 people they're they're she starts crying the audience is booing and goes don't bore you're just going to make her cry more
01:05:51 now it ends this wasn't his daughter it wasn't even a child was an actress this was all set up he's exploiting
01:05:58 their love of children in order to force them to be performers that is trolling no one is actually
01:06:02 getting hurt it's a humorous the twisted exchange if you go online looking for weak people
01:06:13 and you are there to denigrate them just for them being weak or in some way inferior to you that is
01:06:18 the wrong approach i am best on the counter punch a lot of times people come to me and
01:06:24 they'll be like i hope you die you're ugly you're disgusting and there's this great quote from billy idol
01:06:29 which i'm going to mangle where he sums in the effect of i love it when people are rude to me
01:06:33 then i can stop pretending to be nice then you start fights now it's a chance for me to finish it and make an example
01:06:38 of this person but that's very very different from i'm gonna go around
01:06:43 and humiliate people for the sake of doing it in my view and i can see how one would lead to the
01:06:50 other yeah but that's my fundamental concern with it so i my dream is to put use technology
01:06:58 create platforms that  increase the amount of love in the world and to me trolling is
01:07:07 doing the opposite so like andy kaufman is brilliant so i love obviously it sounds like i'm a robot saying i love
01:07:15 humor okay humor is good one one zero one one one one but but like it's
01:07:26 i just see like 4chan i see that you can often see that humor quickly turn yeah because what happens is a lot of
01:07:32 low status people this is their one mechanism through sadism  to feel empowered and then they can hide behind well i'm
01:07:40 just joking that people do which is like they'll say like the
01:07:49 shittiest thing right and then they feel lol after like as if i don't i don't even know
01:07:56 like what is happening in the dark mind of yours because they are feeling powerless in their lives
01:08:01 right and they see someone who they perceive as higher status or more powerful than them or even not appear
01:08:07 and they through their words cause a reaction in this person so they feel like they are in a very literal sense making a
01:08:13 difference on earth and they matter in a very dark way  it's it's disturbing this is not i
01:08:18 mean it's unfortunate that that term trolling is used for that as opposed to what andy kaufman does as opposed to what i do
01:08:28 it's it really is  a sinister thing and it's something i'm not at all a fan of or how do we
01:08:35 how do we fight that so like a neighboring concept of that is conspiracy theories
01:08:40 which is i don't think they're neighboring at all well let me let me give myself a naive
01:08:46 perspective maybe you can educate me on this from my perspective conspiracy theories are these constructs
01:08:52 of ideas that go deeper and deeper and deeper into creating worlds
01:09:05 where there's powerful pedophiles controlling things like these  very sophisticated models of the world
01:09:14 that you know in part might be true but in large part i would say are are figments of imagination that become
01:09:22 really useful constructs and self-reinforcing self-reinforcing for then feeding like empowering the trolls
01:09:32 to attack the powerful the conventionally powerful i i don't think that that's a function conspiracy
01:09:38 theories now let's talk about conspiracy theories because one of my quotes is you take one red pill not the whole bottle
01:09:45 this concept that everything in life is at the function of a small cadre of individuals would be for many people reassuring
01:09:54 because as bad as it looks you know they whoever they are it's usually the jews
01:09:59 aren't going to let it get that bad that they will pull back or the the black pill is that they are intentionally
01:10:07 trying to destroy everything and there's nothing we can do and we're doomed and there's an amazing book by arthur herman
01:10:11 called the idea of decline western history i it's one of my top 10 books where he goes through every 20 years how there's
01:10:18 a different population that say it's the end of the world here's the proof and very often the proof is
01:10:22 something that is kind of self-fulfilling where there's no it's not falsifiable
01:10:27 and we both have to think of ways to falsify our claims from earlier yeah so it is a big danger it's a big danger online
01:10:37 because very quickly if someone who you thought was good but now is bad on one aspect well
01:10:41 they're controlled opposition or they've been  taken over or they've been kind of
01:10:47  appropriated by the bad people whoever those bad people would be i don't know that i have a good
01:10:52 answer for this i don't think it's as pervasive as people think
01:10:56 the number of people who believe conspiracy theory right the i mean and also conspiracy theory is a term
01:11:03 used to dismiss ideas that have some currency the constitutional convention was a conspiracy
01:11:07  the founding fathers got together secretly under water secrecy in philadelphia said we're throwing out the
01:11:11 articles of confederation we're making new government right yeah yeah and luther martin left and he told
01:11:16 everyone this is a conspiracy and they're like yeah whatever luther morgan so and jeffrey epstein was a conspiracy
01:11:21 harvey weinstein was a conspiracy bill cosby conspiracy they all knew they didn't care  communist
01:11:26 infiltration in america there's a great book by eugene lyons called the red decade they
01:11:31 all knew they every atrocity that  was done under stalinism was
01:11:37 excused in the west and if you didn't believe it oh you've got this crazy anti-russian conspiracy
01:11:42 so it's a term that is weaponized  in a negative sense but that does not all imply that it does
01:11:46 not have very negative real life consequences because it's kind of a cult of one right like
01:11:54 i'm at home on my computer i bang to this ideology anyone who doesn't agree with me they're blind
01:12:01 they're oblivious mom and dad my friends you don't get it we were warned about people like you and
01:12:08 i think there's a very heavy correlation and i'm not a psychiatrist of course between that and certain types of mild
01:12:13 melt illness like  you know some kind of paranoid schizophrenia things like that because
01:12:17 after a certain point if everything is a function this conspiracy it's it's there's no randomness or
01:12:22 beauty in life yeah i mean i don't know if you can say anything interesting about it
01:12:30 in the way of advice of how to take a step into conspiracy theory world without completely going like diving deep
01:12:39 because it seems like that's what happens people can't look at jeffrey epstein i can tell you
01:12:44 what the device i'd have seriously and rigorously without going because you can look at jeffrey epstein
01:12:51 and say there's a deeper thing you can always go deeper right it's like jeffrey epstein was just the tool
01:12:59 of  the lizard people and the lizard people are well they say satanists in this case and
01:13:07 somehow recently very popular pedophiles somehow always involved i'm not understanding any of that i
01:13:14 legitimately i say this both humorously and seriously i need to look into it and i guess the bigger question i'm
01:13:21 asking how does a serious human being  somebody with a position at a respectable university
01:13:27 like look at a conspiracy theory and look into it when i look at somebody like jeffrey epstein
01:13:32 who had a role at mit yeah oh yeah and i and i think i'm not happy personally
01:13:41 i didn't i wasn't there when jeffrey epstein was there i'm not happy with the behavior of people
01:13:48 now about jeffrey epstein about the bureaucracy and the everybody's trying to keep quiet hoping
01:13:54 it blows over without really looking into any like looking in a deep philosophical way of like how do we
01:14:02 let this human being be among us can i give you a better example sure that that is
01:14:08 kind of conspiratorial the speaker of the house the longest serving republican speaker of the house dennis hastert was
01:14:12 a pedophile he went to jail the democrats don't throw this in the republicans faces
01:14:18 every five minutes not even democratic activists i find that very very odd
01:14:24 and not what i would predict now i'm not saying there's some kind of conspiracy but when it comes to things like sexual
01:14:29 predation which is something that i'm very very concerned about i'm an uncle now my sister just had her second
01:14:34 kid recently he's adorable it's something that i don't understand if it feels
01:14:44 as if there's a lot of people who want this to all go away now i think it's also because we don't
01:14:49 have the vocabulary and framework to discuss it because when you start talking about
01:14:52 things like children these kind of issues we want to believe it's all crap because it's for those of us who aren't in this
01:14:59 kind of mindset the idea that this happens to kids and happens frequently is something so horrible
01:15:04 yeah that we it's just like i don't even want to hear it and that does these children and adult survivors an
01:15:08 enormous disservice so i don't know that i have any particular insight on this but see like
01:15:13 how do you i mean the catholic church again there's all these topics that
01:15:18 public school teachers are far more proportionally  better as the children of the catholic church
01:15:23 i mean i don't know what i you're right you're right perhaps some  i've been you know reading a lot about
01:15:31 stalin and hitler yeah somehow it's more comforting yeah like to be here and then and then and then
01:15:38 the atrocities that are happening now it's a little bit more difficult because there was a new york times article
01:15:43 interrupted where they were had a people tracking down child pornography and i think the article said they didn't
01:15:48 have enough people just to cover the videotapes of infants being raped and we can even wrap our heads around like
01:15:54 reading lolita like okay she's 14 12. okay it's still a female an infant
01:16:00 it's it's something that again like with the stalin example we sat down here for a hundred years we
01:16:03 would never think of something like this think of in a sexual context it makes no sense yeah so and the fact that this is
01:16:09 international okay we eliminated completely in america well then they're gonna go find this
01:16:14 there's infants all over the world there's video cameras over the world so then it has to become a conspiracy
01:16:18 because i someone has to film it i'm filming it you're buying it your kid
01:16:25 it is literally a conspiratorial not in the sense of like a mafia conspiracy or some government illuminati
01:16:31 but there is our networks designed to produce this product see but like what i'm
01:16:39 i'm trying to do now i mean part of the one of the nice things with like a podcast and other things i'm involved with
01:16:45 is i'm removing myself from having any kind of boss so i can do whatever yes oh it's so it's
01:16:50 so wonderful that just happened to me it's it's the most wonderful thing ever so i could do i can actually in moderation
01:16:58 consider like look into stuff careful though i was going to write a book about this and people pointed out
01:17:02 you sure want to do this research because if you start googling around for this kind of stuff it's on your computer
01:17:09 oh in that sense yeah i'm more concerned about you know it's the nietzsche thing looking into the abyss like you want to
01:17:13 be very yeah i believe i can do this kind of thing in moderation without slipping
01:17:19 oh yes into the depths of course i think that's that's intelligence that's  like i recently quote unquote looked
01:17:26 into like the ufo community the extraterrestrial whatever community i think it always
01:17:34 frustrated me that the scientific community like rolled their eyes at all the ufo
01:17:39 sightings all that kind of stuff even though there could be fascinating beautiful physical fun
01:17:45 like first of all there could be like lightning or the ball lightning right that's at the very basic level is a
01:17:51 fascinating thing and also it could be something like i mean i i don't know but
01:17:59 this could be something interesting like worth looking into my grandfather was an air traffic controller back in
01:18:05 the soviet union and he said we saw this stuff all the time these are planes that were not
01:18:10 moving or whatever things that were not moving according to anything we knew about so it's
01:18:14 absolutely real he's not some jerk with an iphone in his backyard this is a a military professional
01:18:22 who understood technology who knew where the secret bases were so if he's telling me it's something doesn't mean it's
01:18:28 martians but he's telling me there's something there and there are many examples of of these like military
01:18:32 people these aren't some laymen who sees a story they're legit people yeah and and so it's you you can dismiss when
01:18:38 you're talking about professionals who are around aircraft all the time who are familiar
01:18:42 with aircraft at the highest levels and they're seeing things that they can't explain it's they're clearly not
01:18:47 stupid and they're clearly not under form so might there's different ways to dismiss ideas
01:18:51 for example i i'm  you were saying that trolling is a good mechanism
01:18:57 i'm against that but i'm not dismissing it by like rolling my eyes i'm considering
01:19:03 legitimately that you're way smarter than me and you understand the world better than
01:19:07 me like i'm allow myself to consider that possibility and thinking about it like maybe that's true like seriously
01:19:13 considering it that's what that's i feel the way people should approach intelligent people serious quote-unquote
01:19:21 people scientists should approach conspiracy theories like look at it carefully you know is first of all is
01:19:29 it possible that the earth is flat it's not trivial to show that the earth is not flat it's a very good exercise
01:19:34 you should go through it yes but once you go through it you realize that
01:19:41  based on a lot of data and a lot of evidence and there's a lot of different experiments you could do yourself actually
01:19:47 to show that the earth is not flat okay the same kind of process can be taken for a lot of different conspiracy
01:19:53 theories and it's helpful and without slipping into the depths of of lizard people running everything
01:20:03 that's where i i've now listened to two episodes of of alex jones's show because he goes crazy
01:20:16 into different kind of world views that i was not familiar with right and i don't know what to make of it i
01:20:21 mean the reason i've been listening to it is because there's been a lot of discussions
01:20:27 about platforming of different people and i've been thinking about what is censorship mean
01:20:34 i've been thinking about it whether because joe rogan  said he's gonna have alex on again
01:20:43 and then i enjoyed it as a fan just the entertainment of it but then i actually listened to alex
01:20:51 and i was thinking is this human being dangerous for the world like is the ideas he's saying dangerous
01:20:56 for the world i'm more concerned with the russian conspiracy that we had for three years
01:21:00 and the claim that our election was not legitimate and that everyone in the trump white house is a stooge of putin
01:21:05  and the people who said this had no consequences for this alex jones doesn't have the respect that they do
01:21:11  these are both areas of concern for me but he he might if there's if he's given more platforms so like the the
01:21:19 the the people who've and i'd be curious if i'm also a little bit i don't know what to think about the idea that
01:21:28 russians hacked the election the it seems too easily accepted in the mainstream media
01:21:32 hillary clinton said that how they did it was they had ads on the dark web now you and i both know what the dark
01:21:40 web is so the possibility of ads in the dark web having an influence
01:21:46 from a proportional influence on the election is literally zero perhaps i should look into it more
01:21:52 carefully but i've found very little good data on exactly what did the russians do to hack
01:21:58 elections like like technically speaking what are we talking about here like
01:22:03 as opposed to these kind of weird like the best thing there's a couple books and like reporting on like farms
01:22:12 control farms troll farms but let's see the data like how many exactly what are we talking about like
01:22:19 what were they doing relative not just like some anecdotal discussions of
01:22:26 but like relative to the bigger the size of facebook like if there's a few people several hundred say the posting
01:22:36 different political things on facebook relative to the full size of facebook let's look at the full
01:22:42 size like right you're thinking like a scientist the actual impact like the because it's fascinating the social
01:22:49 dynamics of viral information of videos when when  donald trump retweets something
01:22:55 i think that's understudied the effect of that  like he retweeted a clip with joe rogan on
01:23:05  with and mike tyson where mike tyson says that he finds fighting orgasmic i don't
01:23:10 understand that but it'd be fascinating to think like what is the ripple effect on the social
01:23:17  dynamic of our society from retweeting a clip about mike ty what's your favorite um
01:23:25 trump tweet i i tuned the model a long i have it's the this goes to the you and i have a different relationship
01:23:36 with donald trump you appreciate the art form of trolling non-sexual non-sexual yeah so
01:23:44 i i tend to prefer  bill clinton he's more my type no i'm just kidding  i don't know
01:23:48 you don't like that consent stuff no because no  no you appreciate the art form of
01:23:55 trolling and and  donald trump is is  a a master he's the da vinci of trolling so i tend to
01:24:04 think that trolling is ultimately destructive for society and then donald trump takes nothing
01:24:08 seriously he's playing a game he's making a game out of everything takes a lot of things seriously i think
01:24:12 he's very committed to international peace i say i i shouldn't speak so strongly i think
01:24:19 i think it takes actually yes a lot of things seriously i meant on twitter and the game of politics
01:24:27 yeah he is he only takes irreverently yeah yeah and i appreciate it i just
01:24:40 would like to focus on like genuine real expressions of humanity especially positive well this is my love this is my favorite
01:24:47 tweet my fans got it laser etched and put in a block of lucite for me and he said
01:24:53 every time i speak of the losers and haters i do so with great affection they cannot help the fact that they were
01:25:00 born up that's an actual trump tweet it's my favorite one and that's kind of nice that's love
01:25:08 that's love that's kind of nice that i mean exclamation point even i broke legs what is love
01:25:24 yeah the sparks are flying but  i have to kind of analyze that from like a literary perspective but
01:25:29 it seems like there's love in there like a little bit like it's a little bit light-hearted because
01:25:34 he's saying even when i'm going after them don't take it so seriously yeah that's that's nice it is nice
01:25:40 acknowledging the game of it yes that's nice  he's not always something he's very very vicious yeah
01:25:46 very vicious he's done things that i i can tell you about that i'm like this is a bad person
01:25:53 what do you think about one of the okay listen i'm not i for people listening i do not have
01:25:59 trump derangement syndrome i'm i don't i see i try to look for the good and the bad in everybody
01:26:07 one thing perhaps it's irrational but perhaps because i've been reading history i the one triggering thing for me
01:26:18 is the delaying of elections i believe in elections and this is this is the part that you
01:26:24 probably disagree with but i you know i believe in the value of people voting
01:26:32 and i just seen too many dictators the the place where they finally the big switch happens
01:26:39 when you question the legitimacy of elections who's been questioning the legitimacy of elections for the last
01:26:42 three years i've only heard donald trump do it last like year but the last three years
01:26:47 you're saying somebody else you don't think not my president illegitimate we're not going to
01:26:53 normalize him as president russia hacked this election impeached you're not a real president
01:26:57 you don't think that's questioning legitimacy of 2016. no it's a good  i haven't been paying
01:27:02 attention enough but i would i would imagine that argument has been
01:27:08 that i haven't actually heard too many people but i imagine that's been a popular oh very much yeah okay i
01:27:16 but nevertheless that's a part that didn't  that's not a statement that gained power
01:27:22 enough to say that barack obama will keep being president or hillary clinton should be president
01:27:31 newsweek had that article how hillary clinton could still be president newsweek no but she's not that's what i'm saying
01:27:37 my worry isn't my worry isn't  saying that the election was illegitimate and people
01:27:45 whining and mass scale and then the fox news or cnn reporting for years or books being written
01:27:53 for years my worry is legitimately martial law a person's ma stays president
01:27:59 so here's the issue like there's a there's a shift that i have not i i i did a book
01:28:04 on north korea i'm not someone who thinks dictatorship should be taken lightly
01:28:08 i'm not someone who thinks it can't happen here  i i think a lot of times people are desperate for dictatorship so
01:28:14 am with you and i think this is something if you're going to hand wave it away
01:28:18 everyone else hand waved it away hitler's never going to be chancellor he's a lunatic
01:28:22 he's a joke he's a joke that he they couldn't find a publisher from mineconf in english
01:28:27 because this is a guy from some random minor party in germany spouting nonsense who's going to read this crap
01:28:32 you know so i i completely agree with you  you don't think we're there my point is donald trump this year
01:28:40 had every  pathway open to him to declare martial law the cities were being burnt down he
01:28:46 could have very easily sent in the tanks  and people would have been applauding him from his side he feels so good right
01:28:51 now but am i wrong though no i what he did he tweeted out to mayor wheeler of
01:28:58 portland he said call me we will we will solve this in minutes but you
01:29:04 have to call and he sat in his hands and they said oh it's his fault the city is burning down he's not doing
01:29:09 anything and he goes i'm not doing anything until you ask me to do it so i think that
01:29:15 is even if you think he's an aspiring dictator that is at least a sign that there is some restraint
01:29:23 on his aspirations can i just take that in as a beautiful like moment of hope so i'm i'm gonna
01:29:30 remember this ted cruz beautiful ted i'm gonna i'm gonna remember that i mean
01:29:38  i i should say that perhaps i'm irrationally this is the one moment where i feel myself being a little
01:29:44 i i don't like it i think there's an asymmetry because it's kind of like okay either i if i leave the house it's like russian roulette
01:29:52 yeah maybe it's like a one and six shot i'm pulling the trigger i'm killing myself but
01:29:57 that's one in six that's not and and the consequences are so dire that a little paranoia would go a long
01:30:02 way there's something that you can't go back yeah you it's an asymmetry yeah and the the thing is
01:30:11 the thing that makes donald trump new to me and again i'm a little naive in these things but he surprised me
01:30:23 in how many ways he just didn't play by the rules yeah and he's made me a little ant in this
01:30:30 ant colony think like well do you have to play by the rules at all
01:30:38 right like why are we having elections why just say like it's coronavirus time like it's
01:30:44 it's  not healthy to have elections like we shouldn't be like i could if i put my dictator hat on
01:30:50 nancy pelosi said that joe biden shouldn't debate yeah  did she yes she says
01:30:56 she shouldn't dignify trump with the debate he's the president he could be the worst president on earth evil
01:31:00 despicable monster i'll take that as an argument so she's playing politics but she's i don't think
01:31:05 that's playing politics i think when there's a certain point where things get and when things get  when you start
01:31:10 attacking institutions for the the emergencies at the moment and acting arbitrarily that is when things
01:31:16 are the slippery slope yeah so you're saying debates is one of the institutions like that's one of the
01:31:20 traditions to have the debates i think the debates are extremely important  and now i don't think that
01:31:25 someone's a good debater is going to make a good president i mean that's that's a big problem but
01:31:29 you're just saying this is attacking just yet another tradition yet another you know like how
01:31:33 if you're dating if you're married to someone and someone throws out the word divorce you can't unring that bell you
01:31:37 threw it out there yeah i'm saying you don't throw things out like that unless
01:31:43 you really are ready to go down this road and i think that is there's nothing in the constitution
01:31:47 about debates we've only had them since 1980 but still i think they are extremely important it's also a great chance for
01:31:54 joe biden to tell him to his face you're full of crap here's what you did here's what you did here's what you did
01:31:57 it's so fascinating that you're both you acknowledge that and you you also see the value of
01:32:05 tearing down the entire thing so you're both worried about no debates or at least in your voice in your tone
01:32:13 there's a great quote by chesterton i'm not a fan of him at all but he says before you tear down a fence make sure
01:32:19 you know why they put it up first so i am for tearing it all down but there's something called a controlled
01:32:25 demolition like building seven we knew we were in tel aviv and hashtag building seven we knew we were intelligent
01:32:38 wow you're faster than me you're you're operating in a different level i need to upgrade my operating system i
01:32:46 told you when it was 95. yeah building seven if you're gonna  it's like indiana
01:32:53 jones right if you're gonna tear pull something away make sure you have something in place first as opposed to
01:32:57 just breaking it and then just especially in politics it because it escalates and when things escalate
01:33:03 without any kind of response it it can go in a very bad that's when napoleon comes in
01:33:11 so what's your prediction about the the biden trump debates again i just have this weird maybe we'll
01:33:18 return to maybe not in this how do we put more love into the world
01:33:23 and like one of the things that worries me about the debates is it'll be it'll be the the world's
01:33:33 greatest troll against the the grandpa and the porch who grabbed his pants
01:33:40 yeah yeah and it'll it will not put more love into the world it it will it will create more mockery
01:33:48 like  joe biden did a great job against paul ryan in 2012. paul ryan was no lightweight no one thought he was a lightweight
01:33:55 joe biden handed sarah pale in her ass in 2008 which isn't as easy to do as you think
01:33:59 because she's a female so you're going to come off as bullying that's something you have to worry about
01:34:04 so the guy isn't i think he is in the stages of like cognitive decline
01:34:10 so i think it's going to be interesting  i want it to be um
01:34:17 like mike tyson beating up a child because it'll be a source of amusement to me
01:34:22 but i don't know how it's gonna go because it's possible that joe biden will be the mike tyson
01:34:26 yes because in his last debate with bernie he was perfectly fine and again the guy was a center for
01:34:31 decades and i don't think anyone if you looked at joe biden in 2010 would have thought this guy is going to
01:34:37 be have his ass handed him a debate you wouldn't think that at all so i don't know who we're going to see
01:34:43 plus he's got a lot of room to attack trump so i'm sure he's gonna come strapped and ready
01:34:49 and he's gonna have his talking points and watch trump dance try to tap dance around him and if
01:34:53 he's in a position i know the rules of the debate are to actually nail him to the wall it
01:34:57 might actually i'm sure he's gonna have a lot of lines too the problem is trump is the
01:35:01 master counter puncher so he like when hillary's you know had her line she's like well it's a good thing
01:35:07 that donald trump isn't in charge of our legal system he's like yeah he'd be in jail it's like it's like oh like you lady you
01:35:15 set him up that's painful to watch yeah those those debates i mean there's something  i think it's actually
01:35:20 analogous i've come to think of it  your conversation with me right now
01:35:27 some sleepy joe i'm playing the role of sleepy joe i actually connect to  joe
01:35:35 because they're also incontinent there's like these weird pauses i do the same i do the same thing it
01:35:42 annoys the out of me that like  in mid-sentence i'll start saying a different thing
01:35:50 and take a tangent i'm not as slow and drunk as i sound always i swear i'm more intelligent underneath lower but less drunk
01:36:01 exactly but the result one of those is true but not both yeah and
01:36:08 and and trump just like you are a master counter puncher so it's going to be messy here's the other
01:36:13 thing in all seriousness chris wallace is the moderator chris wallace has interviewed trump several
01:36:18 times and he was a tough tough questioner so i don't think he's going to come in
01:36:25 there with softball questions i think he's really going to try to nail trump down which is tough to do
01:36:31 i like him a lot yeah he's rea and he's like mr president sir that's not accurate blah blah he's done it and
01:36:36 trump gets very frustrated because he doesn't just let him say whatever he wants and he he hits him
01:36:41 with the follow-up he's he's  i guess he's on fox news and he
01:36:46 i listen to his sunday program  every once in a while  he gives me hope that i don't know
01:36:52 there's something in the voice like that he's not bought he's i i there's no question he's going to take this seriously
01:36:58 which i think is the best you could hope for in a moderator like it feels like there's people that
01:37:04 might actually take the mainstream media into a place that's going to be better in the future
01:37:09 and like we need people like him you mean like rob spear what do you mean like taking the
01:37:14 mainstream media to a better future like bring out the guillotines okay see you you put your anarchist hat
01:37:20 back on i don't think robster is much of an anarchist but yeah i get what you're
01:37:24 saying yeah you don't think there should be a centralized place for news there isn't now
01:37:31 well that's what mainstream media is supposed to represent broken well it's not whatever  what
01:37:36 would he call that a place where people traditionally said was the
01:37:44 like the legitimate source of truth no that's what the media was supposed to represent no i
01:37:48 said i that's their that's their big branding  accomplishment it's okay that was never
01:37:53 true yeah because if we here's what happens we remember the spanish-american war remember the
01:37:58 maine we have to take cuba yellow journalism willie randolph first right then record scratch
01:38:04 and then we're all objective like when did this transition happen according to people when you were saying that the kaiser
01:38:10 is  the worst human being on earth when you were downplaying  stalin and down playing hitler's atrocities
01:38:15 when you were saying we had to be in vietnam at what point wmds when did it change it never changed you just are better con
01:38:22 artists at a certain point and now the mask is dropping yeah but don't you think there's 
01:38:28 at its best like investigative journalism can uncover truth in a way that um
01:38:38 that like reddit  subreddits can't you know read it sure i agree at its best absolutely that's not even dispute
01:38:47 but like don't you think  like fake it until you make it is the right way to do it meaning like
01:38:54 the take the news no no no i meant the new saying like we dream of doing of arriving at the truth and reporting
01:39:01 the truth they don't say that cnn had an advertisement that said this is an apple
01:39:07 we only report facts that's a lie no that's now and now it's clear things have changed and they haven't changed you're
01:39:12 just more you're more aware of chicanery but okay so the how many people died in iraq
01:39:20 because saddam hussein was about to launch wmds who had consequences for this no one
01:39:26 this isn't a minor thing this is lots of dead people yeah and also i mean dead people
01:39:35 it's horrible but also the money which has like we said economic effects marian williamson i think it was it was
01:39:41 had trump both of them had the great point that goes that's like a trillion dollars how many
01:39:43 schools would that build how many roads did that build even here why are we building hospitals in
01:39:47 iraq that we destroyed when we could building hospitals here it makes no sense it's horrifying so
01:39:53 who's responsible for that like who alex jones now meant for well  so who's
01:40:03 responsible for arriving at the truth of that of speaking to the money spent i think this is wars in iraq this is one
01:40:11 of the great things about social media twitter you have faith in twitter not not specifically twitter but yeah social
01:40:16 media as a whole what anyone could be here's a great another great example before if you were talking about police
01:40:23 brutality or these riots you would have to perceive it in the way it was framed and presented to nicholas
01:40:28 sandman is another example  brianna taylor all these things well you're not footage of her
01:40:33 you would have to perceive in the way that it's edited and presented to you by the corporate press
01:40:37 now everyone is a video who has video camera everyone has their perspective and it's very useful when these
01:40:43 incidents happen where you could see the same incident from several angles and you don't need don lemon or chris
01:40:49 wallace to tell me what this means i can see with my own eyes yeah i've been very
01:40:55 pleasantly surprised about the power see like people the mob again gets in the way they get emotional
01:41:02 and they destroy like the the ability for people to reason but you're right that truth is unobstructed
01:41:09 on social media like if you're if you're careful and patient you can see the truth yeah
01:41:16 like for example data on coven some of the best sources are doctors like if you want to know the
01:41:22 truth about the coronavirus of what's happening is  there's follow people on twitter yeah there's certain people there yes
01:41:29 like sourcing for me versus the cdc and the wa show it's that's that's fast i mean it's well it's
01:41:36 kind of anarchy right it's yes it is it's anarchy yes i mean well there's some
01:41:42 censorship and all that kind of stuff you have censorship under anarchy in the sense that you're talking about like
01:41:45 people be kicked off on twitter that's a drawing somebody okay
01:41:52 so i mean it's a private company private company most people wouldn't say twitter's working but they that's probably because
01:41:59 they take for granted how well it's working and they're just complaining about the small part of it
01:42:09 okay another question about don't you feel better no by the way i mean i had a personal
01:42:17 gripe with the situation about the not a personal gripe but i felt overly emotional about um
01:42:27 the possibility that there will be some of donald trump messing with the election process but
01:42:33 you made me feel better like saying like he if he had a bunch of opportunities to to do what like
01:42:41 to do what i would have done if i was a dictator i would the first time those rides over george
01:42:48 floyd i would instituted martial law do you know what i remember very vividly
01:42:54 is after 9 11 and everyone was waiting for george bush to give his speech and he had 98 approval rating and i
01:42:59 remember very vividly because if he had said we're suspending the constitution everyone had cheered for him
01:43:05 like he couldn't get enough support at that time and he didn't do it and i can't say anything really good
01:43:11 about george w bush i'm not a fan of his to say the least so i think you and i and you know other
01:43:16 people who are familiar with you know  totalitarian regimes to some extent from our ancestry or whatever from research
01:43:23 should always be the ones freaking out and warning but we should also be aware of we got a
01:43:28 ways to go before it's hitler and thankfully  there are a lot of dominoes that have
01:43:36 to fall into place before hitler it's like the game secret hitler it's a board game before hitler becomes hitler like it's not
01:43:43 e especially in america there's lots of things that have to happen before you really get to that point i
01:43:49 mean fdr was for all intensive purposes of dictator but even then the worst you could say
01:43:53 and this is not something that you take lightly was internment of japanese citizens but they weren't murdered
01:43:59  they weren't you know  you know under lock and key in the sense of like in cells
01:44:03 so things could have gotten a lot worse for him we have to i mean hitler is such a horrible person to bring up because
01:44:09 mussolini you know yeah mussolini is better because hitler is so closely connected to the
01:44:15 atrocities of the holocaust right there's all the stuff that led up to the war and the war itself say that there
01:44:19 was no  holocaust hitler will probably be viewed differently
01:44:24 i should yes i should think so well i mean but you think that's a very controversial stance you think hitler
01:44:30 viewed differently if it wasn't for the holocaust well i mean but it's a funny thing that the the the
01:44:43 i would say the death of how many 40 50 million i mean i don't know how you calculate it
01:44:50 as is not seen as as bad as the 6 million oh yeah because of mountain and stalin yeah yeah and it but it's interesting 
01:44:58 working on it you're working on yeah the next book i'm talking reminding what's good i'm i'm glad a good writer is because
01:45:04 i'm not reminded my last book the new right you know i had to deal with some like the nazis and one of the points
01:45:08 they make is how come everyone knows about the holocaust but no one knows about the holodomor
01:45:12 and they're right we should know about this because it is a great example of both how the western media
01:45:18 were depraved but also what human beings are capable of and those scars are still you know many
01:45:23 americans think russia and ukraine are the same thing you know that like oh trump's in bed
01:45:27 with ukrainians trump's about the russians they think it's the same thing is for us it's complete lunacy but this
01:45:33 is the kind of thing where pol pot is another example  where people have no clue
01:45:38 of what has been done to their fellow man on the face of this earth and they should know
01:45:42 how much of that do you lay at the hands of communism how much are you with like jordan pearson who has as
01:45:51 intricately connecting the atrocities like like you're saying 1930s ukraine where people were starved
01:45:57 i recently said my grandmother recently passed away and she she looked she survived that as like as
01:46:03 a kid which is it's fat those people i mean just they're tough they're tough
01:46:11 like that whole region is tough because they survived that and then right after the occupation of nazis
01:46:20 yeah of germans how much do you lay that at communism as an ideology versus stalin the man
01:46:29  i think you know lenin was building concentration camps you know while he was around in slave labor um
01:46:36 i i don't i think it's clearly both there are certain variants of communism that were far like khrushchev you know
01:46:41 and gorbachev  the reason the soviet union fell apart and this is kind of i'm going to
01:46:46 spoil the end of the book there's an amazing book called revolution 1989 it's like the most
01:46:50 beautiful book i've ever read by victor sebastian he's a hungarian author and basically what happens in
01:46:56 1989 poland has their elections and then then in 1990 they kind of let in the labor people into the government
01:47:02 and people start crossing borders you know in the eastern bloc and you had hanukkah from eastern
01:47:07 germany and  chances from romania colin gorbachev because those are the two toughest ones
01:47:13 by communist standards they go they're they're just escaping we're gonna we're gonna lose everything
01:47:17 you gotta send in the tanks like you did in hungary like you did in czech republic surviving 68
01:47:21 and gorbachev goes i'm not sending the tanks and they go dude if you don't sing in the tanks
01:47:27 it's all done and he goes nope i'm not that kind of guy and they were right i mean they 
01:47:31 coaches was personally shot with his wife up against the wall hanukkah i forget what happened to him
01:47:37 but it they all self-liberated my friend who was born in czech czechoslovakia his mom was pregnant you
01:47:42 know under communism and she never even imagined he'd be free and he was born under free
01:47:46  and they were all looking around all these countries that self-liberated because they're like this is a trick
01:47:50 right they're just they're trying to figure out who's like not good so that they can arrest us on mass and
01:47:56 they didn't so although even within communism there are bad guys and better guys but we talked
01:48:05 about anarchy we talk about democracy do you see like there's democratic socialism conversations going on
01:48:14 in the popular culture socialism is seen as like evil or for some people great sure
01:48:22 what like what are your thoughts about is in a political ideology evil so you're on the evil side yes fundamentally
01:48:34 you know what yeah what makes it evil what's like structurally if you were to try to analyze like sure
01:48:39 this i say three ways morally no person has the right to tell another person how to live their life
01:48:46 economically it's not possible to make calculations under socialism it's only the
01:48:51 price the prices that are information that tells me oh this is we need to produce more of this we need to produce
01:48:54 less of this without prices being able to adjust and give information to producers and
01:49:00 and consumers you have no way of being able to produce  effectively efficiently and also
01:49:07 it is  it turns people against each other when you force people to interact when you force them into relationships when
01:49:13 you force them into jobs and you don't give them any choice when there's a monopoly  the consequence of
01:49:18 monopoly everyone's familiar with ostensibly under capitalism but somehow when it's a government monopoly
01:49:22 all those economic principles don't work doesn't make any sense but there's force in democracy too
01:49:27 it's just you're saying there's a there's a bit more force in  in socialism yeah but that's interesting
01:49:34 that you say that there's not enough information i mean that's ultimately you need to have really good data yes
01:49:43 to achieve the goals of the system even even if there's no corruption right you just need to have the
01:49:48 information right which you can't like really strong real-time real-time information that and if like
01:50:02 capitalism at its best and cleanest which is like perfect information is available there's no manipulation of information
01:50:08 that's what you know that's one of the problems okay can we talk about some candidates
01:50:15 the ones we got and possible alternatives so one question i have is why do we have within this system why do we
01:50:26 have the candidates we have is it seems maybe you can correct me highly unsatisfactory like the
01:50:37 like is anyone actually excited about our current candidates i'm kind of excited because no matter
01:50:44 who wins the elections can be hilarious so that is something that i'm excited about from  from a human perspective yeah
01:50:50 is that what the whole system is  so that's the one theory of the case is the entire thing is optimized for viewership
01:50:59 yeah and  excitement by definitions of like the reality show kind of excitement i think it is if you look at what
01:51:06 happened with brett kavanaugh this is not a career that would draw people who are you might say quality
01:51:15 because no matter who they are there would be a huge incentive from the other team to denigrate them and humiliate them in
01:51:22 the worst possible ways because as the two teams lose their legitimacy among gen pop it's going to get harder and
01:51:28 harder for them to maintain any kind of claims to authority which is something i like
01:51:34 but which does kind of play out in you know certain nefarious ways so people the best of the best are not
01:51:39 going to want to be politicians yeah because like i could have a job or have a job interview and i'm running
01:51:47 yahoo or whatever or i could for 18 months have to eat you know corn dogs looking like i'm going down on someone and shake
01:51:52 hands and have all this my family and on social media daily
01:51:58 called the worst things for what and then i'm still not guaranteed the position but the flip side of that like from my perspective
01:52:09 is the competition is weak meaning like you need a certain a minimum amount of eloquence clearly
01:52:17 that i don't  the bar which i did not pass i don't think either of them would be considered particularly eloquent biden
01:52:21 or trump no i know but that's what i'm saying the competition like if
01:52:27 if you were wanted to be become a politician if you wanted to run for president the opportunity is there like if you
01:52:33 were at all competent like if you had so like andrew yang is an example of somebody who has a bunch
01:52:38 of ideas is somewhat  eloquent like young energetic it feels like there should be
01:52:47 thousands of andrew yangs like that would enter the domain and he went nowhere
01:52:53 well he j well i i wouldn't say he went nowhere he generated quite a bit of excitement he just didn't go very
01:53:00 far that's okay you don't have to run for president to generate excitement with your ideas you could be a podcast
01:53:04 host i'm not even joking that's right that's right that's right and he's both andrew yang oh he's a
01:53:12 podcast yeah he has a podcast called yang speaks no okay cool
01:53:23 oh wow the music of the way you said yeah cool is the way my mom talks to me when i tell her with
01:53:33 oh that's nice honey oh you made a robot that's cool that makes coffee oh you're still single
01:53:40 though aren't you ah i wonder why i wonder why make yourself a robot wife
01:53:49 give me some robot grandchildren okay but first of all okay let me ask you about
01:54:00 fresh energy you don't find him fresh or energetic you know like is there any candidate you wish was in the mix that was in the mix
01:54:09 you wish was one of the last two remaining yeah people like marion williamson i thought
01:54:14 was great  tulsi i thought was great amy klobuchar got a bad rap
01:54:21 i think she held her own smart she wasn't particularly funny and that's okay i think she was not threatening to a lot
01:54:27 of people what did you like about them i guess it's named all women that's interesting it wasn't even intentional um
01:54:33 tulsi i like that she was aggressive has a good resume and is not um
01:54:39 staying the course for the establishment marion williamson i like because she comes from a place
01:54:44 from what it seems of genuine compassion maybe she's a sociopath i don't know i read her book and it actually affected
01:54:50 me profoundly because it's very rare when you read a book and there's even that one idea that
01:54:55 blows your mind and that you kind of think about all the time and there was one of that such idea
01:54:58 in her book about she was teaching something called the course in miracles in
01:55:03 hollywood i think she still teaches it and this was during the 80s the high the aids crisis
01:55:09 and all these young men in the prime of their life were dropping like flies and she's trying to give him hope well
01:55:16 good luck they're dying no one cares and they're like you can't tell us that they're going to cure this
01:55:21 like you're that's a lie and she goes what if i told you they're not going to cure it what if i
01:55:26 told you it's going to be to like diabetes they cut off your foot and you're going to go blind would that be something that
01:55:32 you can hope for and when you put it like that it's like yeah like if you're talking to
01:55:36 him like a homeless junkie and you're like you could be a doctor you're a lawyer or a lawyer like cool
01:55:40 story like you could have a studio apartment with a terrible roommate and a shitty job
01:55:48 but when you're on the street you know cooking need breakfast in a teaspoon and you hear
01:55:52 that you're like wait would that really be so bad is that really so much worse than this no and it becomes
01:55:57 something so when she put it in those terms i'm like wow this woman that really did a number on me in terms of teaching
01:56:04 people how to be hopeful small steps but it's but it's also then it becomes less of
01:56:10 i need a miracle to be like oh this is really magical yeah it's and it's absurd to think it's impossible
01:56:17 what about what's your take on unity 2020 that brett weinstein 
01:56:24 pushed forward it i i it was doa  he couldn't even stand up to twitter dead on the rival in rival he couldn't
01:56:29 even stand up to twitter let alone or to facebook they got blocked let alone hugely problematic by the way that
01:56:35 twitter would block that not at all i don't know why they blocked it but i believe
01:56:40 i don't know problematic means that's a word that does a lot of work  that people wanted to do conceptually um
01:56:47 the idea that like unity is like taking the rejects from each party and we're gonna like have something that
01:56:52 no one likes and therefore it's gonna be a compromise is absurd the last time we had this kind of
01:56:57 unity ticket was the civil war when you had andrew johnson from the democrats and lincoln from the
01:57:02 republicans this was not something that ended well  particularly nicely for both halves
01:57:06 of the country so that that's the way you see it as like the way i saw i i guess i haven't
01:57:11 looked carefully at it i haven't either to be fair yeah the way i saw it is
01:57:17 emphasizing centrists which is  how's celsius centrist tulsa was involved yes he's trying to
01:57:22 push tulsi and like jesse ventura or something oh so oh okay i don't know i don't know the specific as a scientist you also
01:57:29 know centrism is not a coherent term in politics but see now you're like   what is it pleading to authority no i'm
01:57:37 treating my ego no no i'm pleading to how you approach data if someone is saying the mean is accurate
01:57:44 that only mean i mean the mean could be anywhere it's a function of what's around it doesn't mean it's true
01:57:48 i don't even know what  census is supposed to mean but what it means to me there's no idea essentia
01:57:56 centrist there's more of a center right or center left to me what that means is somebody who is
01:58:05 a liberal or conservative but is open-minded and  empathetic to the other side
01:58:15 joe biden had the crime bill joe biden voted for republican supreme court justices joe biden voted for a balanced budget
01:58:21 joe biden voted for bush's war he and i'm sure probably haven't looked this up the patriot act yeah if you want
01:58:25 a centrist you have joe biden yeah okay he's worked very well with the republicans that argument could be made
01:58:29 of course they'll everybody will always  resist that argument
01:58:34 you it's undeniable in fact during the campaign some   activists started yelling at him at a town hall
01:58:42 not yelling just saying hey we need open borders joe biden says i'm not for open borders go vote for trump and literally turned
01:58:48 his back on the man and this is during the primaries where it would behoove you to try to appeal to
01:58:54 the base and of course you can probably also make the argument that donald trump is center right if not
01:58:59 center left well i mean he's he's very  unique as a personality right but if you look at his
01:59:06 record and his first name is rhetoric you can say is not centrist at all but in terms of how he governs the
01:59:11 budgeting i mean has been very moderate it certainly hasn't been like draconian budget cuts
01:59:17  the supreme court you could say okay he's hard right immigration you could say in certain
01:59:21 capacities he's hard right but in terms of pro-life what has he done there in terms of you know so it's in many other aspects
01:59:28 he's been very much this kind of me too  republican but certainly the rhetoric
01:59:32 it's very hard to make in the case that he's a centrist so you don't like  is there any other
01:59:37 idea you find compelling like you what i like about unity 2020 is just an idea for  a different way for like a
01:59:46 different party a different path forward so ideas just like anarchy is an interesting idea
01:59:53 that's that leads to discourse at least i don't think it's interesting at all and here's why i think it's interesting
01:59:58  sweden has eight parties in its parliament iceland population's like 150 000 they've got nine i think it was czech
02:00:05 republic has nine britain has five so the claim that two  parties is the sensorious of speech but three oh
02:00:15 now all of a sudden it makes no sense doesn't import to the data number one number two is donald trump demonstrated
02:00:20 that you can be basically a third-party candidate seize the machinery of a existing party and appropriate to
02:00:26 your own hands as bernie sanders almost did bernie sanders has never been a democrat  major credit to him for
02:00:32 that's not easy to be elected as senator as an independent he's done it repeatedly so these are two examples of ossified elites
02:00:38  right for the picking so to have a third party makes  no real sense speaking of which
02:00:52 and  let's look this is a personal challenge to you let me bring up the libertarian party
02:00:56 yeah and the personal challenge is to go five minutes without mocking them okay in discussing  and discussing
02:01:04 this idea so first of all there was an episode where chandler had to not make fun of people like can you
02:01:19 go one day chandler and phoebe starts telling him about like this ufo she saw
02:01:25 and it's like that's very interesting nice for you this is exactly that okay so a true master would be able to
02:01:32 play within the game within the constraints so no i i'm pretty sure you'll still
02:01:38 mock them but no no i'll stick to the rules five minutes easy so first of all speaking broadly about libertarianism
02:01:44 can you speak to that how you feel about it and then also to the libertarian party which is the implementation of it in our current
02:01:52 system so i think libertarianism is a great idea and i think there's many libertarian ideas that have become
02:01:58 much more mainstream which i'm very very happy about i remember there was an article in either new york or new yorker
02:02:05 magazine in the early 90s where they talked about the cato institute which is a libertarian think tank
02:02:10 and they referred to the fact that keda was against war and against like regulation with a wacky consistency
02:02:17 because they didn't know how to reconcile these two things i remember what the two things were but i remember
02:02:22 that expression wacky consistency and it wasn't eve we were all taught and this is very much before the internet
02:02:29 that there's two tribes and if you're pro-life you have to hate gays and if you're for socialized medicine
02:02:38 that also means you have to be for  you know free speech it was just this very and like there's a whole menu and
02:02:43 you got to sign into all of them and that menu is terrible they hate america they want to destroy it
02:02:48 oh my god those are horrible evil this is the menu you want and the libertarian party to some extent and
02:02:54 just libertarian as a whole said you know you can do the chinese buffet and take a little from columbia live
02:02:59 from column b and have an ideology that is coherent and consistent analogy ideology of peace and
02:03:08 non-aggression and things like that the libertarian party takes its model from like the early
02:03:15 progressive and populist parties from the early 20th century which were not very effective in terms
02:03:20 of getting people elected but were extremely effective in terms of getting the two major parties to
02:03:27 appropriate and adopt their ideas and implement them and in britain as well the liberal party got destroyed and
02:03:32 became taken over by labor as the  alternative party to the tories and have those ideas basically become
02:03:39 mainstreamed so i think that and deliberate my friend who passed away eric i miss him dearly
02:03:45 was their webmaster and his whole point is if you don't think about it in terms of a party in terms of getting people elected
02:03:50 but if you think of it as a party in terms of getting people educated about alternatives then there's enormous use for that that
02:03:57 was his perspective and i don't think that's an absurd perspective but here's some libertarian
02:04:01 ideas that have become extremely mainstream war should be a last resort  this is something we're taught as kids and we
02:04:06 all say but for many years it's been like they don't think of it as the last resort
02:04:11 it's like something's bad well it's like the first instinct now it's like let's really give
02:04:15 it a week just a week like what's going on in syria is there really gonna be a genocide the
02:04:19 kurds you know things like that so that's one another thing is drug legalization 
02:04:23 this was you know when you and i were kids oh it's crazy it's only hippies want to smoke pot
02:04:29 now it's like with it i was on a grand jury and the point out people make is are you sure
02:04:35 that this 16 year old who's selling wheat let's say selling should his life be ruined should he be
02:04:41 imprisoned with rapists and murderers like if you say yes say yes but you but are you sure you have to acknowledge
02:04:48 that that's what you're meaning and then a lot of people are like wait a minute there's got to be a third option
02:04:54 then he has no consequences or he's imprisoned with the rapist like i'm not comfortable with either of these
02:04:59  and i think the other one is an increasing skepticism this libertarians were on top of this
02:05:04 first and the hard left of the police  as of now asset forfeiture steals more from people than burglaries what
02:05:10 people don't know about what that's their forfeiture is if the cops come to your house and they suspect you you
02:05:15 haven't been convicted of using your car or your house or whatever in terms of selling drugs
02:05:22 they can take whatever they want and then you have to sue to prove your innocence and get your
02:05:27 property back it's a complete violation of due process people don't realize what's going on
02:05:30 it's a great way for the cops to increase their budgets and it's legal and libertarians were like the first big
02:05:36 ones saying guys this is not american and this is crazy and now increasingly people on
02:05:41 conservatives and left is like wait a minute this this is even if you are selling drugs like they
02:05:45 take your house what are you talking about so i think those are some  mechanisms that libertarianism
02:05:51 though but not by name has become far more popular yeah it's interesting so the idea yeah
02:05:56 coherent set of ideas  that that eventually get integrated into a two-party system
02:06:03 yeah the war that's an interesting one you're right i would want i wonder what the thread there is i
02:06:10 wonder how it connects to 911 and so on but i i think that i i think the patriot act
02:06:15 patriot act for people who are politically savvy were like oh okay this is not a joke
02:06:23 this is really a crazy infringement our freedoms and both parties are falling over each other to sign into law
02:06:30 and the orwellian name you don't want to how can you be against patriotism what kind of person
02:06:34 you know what i mean so that i think for a lot of people especially both civil libertarians on the left
02:06:38 and a lot of conservatives who are constitutionalists are like wait a minute this isn't
02:06:42 i'm not comfortable with this and i'm also not comfortable with how comfortable everyone in washington is
02:06:45 with it you're right probably libertarian libertarians and libertarianism
02:06:52 is a place of ideas which is why i have a connection to it like i like i i like the every time i listen
02:06:59 to those folks i like them i feel connected to them i would even sometimes depending on the
02:07:04 day call myself a libertarian well we're on the spectrum so that's why we're on the spectrum yeah
02:07:10 but like when i look at the people that actually rise to the top in terms of like the people who
02:07:16 represent the party this is where like five minutes ran out right you can i could go i'm allowed you
02:07:21 can go why are they so weird why aren't strong candidates emerging that represent
02:07:32 as political like representatives or as like  famous speakers yeah like that represent the ideology i think
02:07:40 libertarians tend to i think jonathan height in his book  in his research he's a political scientist and he does a lot of
02:07:45 things about how people come to their political conclusions and what factors  force people to reach conclusions
02:07:52 and he found that libertarians are the least empathetic and most rationalistic of all the groups and by that he means
02:07:58 like they think in terms of logic as opposed to like people's feelings and and that has positives and has negatives 
02:08:05 it would and we have the a b testing with ron paul ron paul ran for president as a
02:08:11 libertarian nominee he was the nominee he got pretty much nowhere in 1998. then he ran as a
02:08:16 return to republican party as a congressman for many years from texas he ran for the presidency in 2008 and 2012.
02:08:25 and in 2008 he stood on stage with rudy giuliani and told him that they were here in 911 because we're over there
02:08:32 which would have been a shocking horrifying taboo a few years earlier many people were like holy crap this is
02:08:38 amazing julian was all offended and ron paul's like i took some guts by the way yeah it did
02:08:43 i heard that it was so refreshing that not what he said but the fact that he said something that took guts
02:08:51 it made me realize how rare it is yes for peop for politicians but even people to say something that takes guts well
02:08:57 it's also the idea that like you can't even if you think america has a right
02:09:03 to invade any country on earth as much as it wants and kill people as a consequence of war and
02:09:08 blow up their buildings and destroy their country you can't with a straight face not
02:09:12 expect us to have consequences even if they're consequences from evil people
02:09:17 even if we're 100 of the good guys and their 100 the bad guys those bad guys some of them are still
02:09:22 going to try to do something what happens next you know what i mean so that kind of concept
02:09:28 that there's any american culpability was where america where you know we're the good guys by definition we're not culpable
02:09:34 to have people start thinking about what if there's another way you know what if we're not there and
02:09:38 then they're not here and we're kind of doing a back door we're talking so different scenarios
02:09:43 so the fact that he got so much more traction as a republican the fact that donald trump who came out
02:09:48 of nowhere became the not only the candidate but the president tells people
02:09:54 it's like getting a book deal right you can either go there's three choices you can either self-publish mainstream publisher
02:10:03 or independent publisher the independent publisher is the worst of all choices because you're not getting a
02:10:07 big advance they're not going to be able to promote you a lot and
02:10:12 they don't get the distribution mainstream i've done mainstream myself right with self i don't have the the cred
02:10:19 the respectability of a mainstream for the cachet it can't be  new york times bestseller right let's
02:10:24 take six a lot of work but i get a lot more of the profit  if it looks good on the shelf on amazon
02:10:29 looks identical so on and so forth with the mainstream the benefits and costs are pretty much
02:10:34 obvious to most people so the same thing it's like you can either be an independent like ross perot
02:10:40 or you could be just cs won the party apparatus which the benefits are enormous there
02:10:45 but in terms of going third party i don't know the libertarian party apparatus other than maybe some ballot access
02:10:51 is really that efficacious and then you're gonna have a lot of baggage because if you hear independent
02:10:56 jesse ventura ross perot you think of the person now you have to define yourself and you
02:11:01 have to defend the party that's two bridges for most people brilliantly put okay thank you
02:11:09  let me speak to you because i'm i'm speaking to jaron brooke soon yeah 
02:11:17 i like him yeah so but that another example i was ask him to tell you a joke about iran if he can do it so there
02:11:26 that's one criticism i've heard you say which is they're unable to speak to any weaknesses in either iran's or objectivist
02:11:36 worldview yes that's really  you you put it i know you're half joking but
02:11:42 that's actually a legitimate discussion to have i'm not i'm not joking at all because that's to me one of the criticisms
02:11:48 and one of the explanations why the world seems to disrespect ayn rand the the people that do is she
02:11:57 kind of implies that her ideas are like flawless she says they correspond to reality yeah right that's the term she uses
02:12:07 that i mean objective is it's in the name it's you know it's just facts like it's impossible to basically argue
02:12:15 against because it's pretty simple it's just all facts and that's it's possible to argue against but she would say
02:12:21 she's never met a good critic who could argue the facts about misrepresentation and she's not entirely wrong she's often
02:12:25 caricatured because she has a very extreme personality and extreme worldview but that to me i mean some
02:12:30 people there's a guy named in the physics mathematics community called stephen wolf from
02:12:35 i don't know if you're well from alpha yeah okay he has a similar style of speaking sometimes
02:12:41 which is like i've created a science but that turns a lot of people off like this
02:12:48 kind of weird confidence but he's one of my favorite people i think one of the most brilliant people
02:12:55 if you just ignore that little bit of ego or whatever you call that yeah yeah that there are some beautiful ideas in there
02:13:02 and this amazing person and that for me objectivism i'm undereducated about it about it  i hope to be more educated
02:13:10 but there's some interesting ideas that again just like with ufos  not that there's a connection with you
02:13:16 don't bring that up for your own he won't like it i'm runs like ufos oh no no no this
02:13:22 interview is over that's that's a good yarn okay  but you know you have to be a little bit open-minded
02:13:30 but what's your sense of of objectivism what's  are there interesting ideas that are useful to you to think about i own her copy of
02:13:38 the first printing of the fountainhead so that should tell you a little bit about how my affection for miss rand
02:13:44 how heavy that goes i ein rand does not have all the answers but she has all the questions so if you study
02:13:50 rand you are going to be forced to think through some very basic things and you're going to have your eyes open
02:13:55 very very heavily she was not perfect she never claimed to be perfect she was asked on donahue is it true that according to
02:14:02 your philosophy you're a perfect being she said i never think of myself that way and she said but if you ask me do i
02:14:08 practice what i preach the answer is yes resoundingly she's a fascinating woman  what is really interesting about her
02:14:16 and this something you'd appreciate personally is when you read her essays she'll have these weird asides
02:14:22 and it looked like she would talk about art and she'd be like and this is why the u.s should be the only country with
02:14:26 nuclear weapons and when you follow a brilliant mind making these seemingly disparate connections it's something i
02:14:33 find to be just absolutely inspiring and awesome and entertaining i think there's lots of things about
02:14:39 her that people like yaran would make uncomfortable well like she they so objectivism
02:14:48 like any other philosophy has all these techniques to kind of hand wave away things you don't want to
02:14:53 talk about and like pretend that so they talk about things like having no meta metaphysical significance right
02:14:58 so what that means is like well what about this i don't talk about it like it doesn't matter
02:15:01 like it literally means fancy philosophical terms doesn't matter or they will say correctly that it's very
02:15:10 twisted in our culture that when we have heroes we look for their flaws instead of looking for their virtues that's a
02:15:16 100 valid perspective however if i'm sitting here telling you that i think this woman is a badass and
02:15:23 she's amazing and she should be studied but there's also these idiosyncrasies
02:15:28 they don't want to hear it because they and i think it's very convenient for them because there's a lot of things she did
02:15:33 that work here's an example rand was very very pro a happiness and pleasure she was very pro-sex
02:15:39 which is kind of surprising looking at her and how she talked and how strident she was
02:15:43 as a result of this she never got her cats fixed to deny them the pleasure of orgasm so her male cats are spraying up her
02:15:49 entire house yeah like that is i mean that's her putting her philosophy into practice
02:15:56 but it's still gross yeah so that's the kind of thing where i don't think he'd another thing is rand
02:16:00 had an art an article on a woman president and she said a woman should never be president right
02:16:05 now when ran says things that are too goofy for them they say oh that's not objectivism that's her
02:16:11 personal preference it's like she did not have these lines objectivism was always defined as
02:16:18 ein rand's writings plus the additional essays in her books so if this was in part of those books
02:16:24 this counts as official objectivism but they pretend otherwise so that's another example plus
02:16:28 they are they she was and i bet you she was on the spectrum to some extent i'm not joking
02:16:32 i'm not using that derisively she was of the belief and not inaccurately because that humor is used to denigrate
02:16:41 and humiliate and she was thinking about the jon stewart type before there was a john stewart and a lot of times
02:16:47 like how i use mocking but she was resentful correctly that a lot of times people who are great and accomplished
02:16:54 little nobodies will make a punch line  just to bring them down and just bother here's an example i just thought of i
02:16:59 remember in i remember when it was must be in the 90s they had a segment on mtv of all these musicians
02:17:07 who were making their own perfumes right and this girl grabbed princess perfume and before she even smelled it she had
02:17:11 the joke ready she just ugh this smells almost as bad as his music lately it's like first of all i'm sure
02:17:16 the perfume's fine yeah and second of all this is prince he's one of the all-time greats and you
02:17:21 can't wait to you know you know denigrate him like and part i want to be like brown like
02:17:25 how dare you like as if as if this perfume in any way in any way mitigates his amazing
02:17:32 accomplishments and achievements you horrible person but i do have some great iran jokes and he would not be
02:17:38 happy about them the perfume thing the problem with is just not funny not that
02:17:44 no he sucks okay great not that they dared to try to be humorous right because i don't know why you mentioned
02:17:49 jonathan because john stewart's pretty can be funny right but hey he taught a generation you still see this on twitter
02:17:56 where things have to be inherently sarcastic and snide but isn't that i mean aren't you practicing that no i use irony
02:18:03 not sarcasm here's an example when people like you say something and someone reply to be like last i
02:18:09 checked blah blah blah blah and i'll that i see i go what do you think saying last i checked added to your point
02:18:13 you're giving me valuable information and data but you are trained to believe that it
02:18:17 has to be couched in this sneering it doesn't just give me the information this is useful information
02:18:25 that's that's true it's a jerk but see john stewart did it masterfully exactly and they don't and
02:18:29 they they don't it's it's like people you try to copy them and you lose everything in the process of copying
02:18:38 yeah yeah yep okay  but in terms of the the philosophy of
02:18:46 you know selfishness this kind of individual focused idea and i'm i imagine that connects with you
02:18:52 yes and i think it would connect with more people they understood what she meant by nathaniel brandon who was her
02:18:57 heir until she kind of broke with him and and he was a co-dedicatee of atlas shrugged said
02:19:03 no one will say on rand's views with a straight face they won't say i believe that my happiness matters and
02:19:10 is important and it's worth fighting for and that ayn rand says this then she's dangerous now
02:19:15 it's very easy to say this could have dangerous consequences if you're a sociopath but to put it in those terms  i think
02:19:21 is extremely healthy i think more people should want to be happy and and have i think a lot of us are raised to
02:19:27 be apologetic especially in this cynical media culture that if you say i want to be happy i want to
02:19:33 love my life that it's just like okay sweetheart and you the eye rolling and i think that's so
02:19:38 pernicious is so horrifying and this is why i'm a kamu person because camus thought the archenemy was
02:19:42 cynicism and i could not agree more like if you're the kind of person if someone likes a band and you're like oh
02:19:47 you like them blah blah it's like this gives them happiness yeah now there's certain exceptions but if it
02:19:51 gives you happiness it's not for you that's cool okay this is beautiful
02:19:59 i i so agree with you on the eye rolling but you see the best of trolling is not the eye roll correct of course not the
02:20:06 best of trolling is taking down the eye rollers i'm gonna have to think about that okay
02:20:16 yeah  because i put them all type is red bull i kind of put them all in the same bin
02:20:24 okay and they're not they're not they're not okay all right here's another example of trolling i was
02:20:30 making jokes about ron paul he just had a stroke right and someone came at me and they're
02:20:35 like oh blah blah blah you know you're ugly i hope you have a stroke i hope you're in the hospital and
02:20:40 i just go i just did have a stroke on your mom's face so they came at me yeah and now they got
02:20:47 put in their place with a subpar i mean i wasn't clever you weren't you weren't clever not
02:20:55 particularly no well one of your things you do which is interesting i mean i give you props
02:21:01 in a sense is you're willing to go farther than people expect you to yes that's fun
02:21:08 yeah in fact i'll probably edit out like half of this podcast because the the thing you did which she kept in
02:21:14 i should mention is michaela peterson now has a podcast which is nice i guess was it on her podcast she
02:21:19 was at mine she was on yours we did both but this is when you're referring to when she was on mine she
02:21:23 was on yeah right and you went right for the for the so i'll tell you what it was you
02:21:30 don't have to paraphrase so i opened up i say you know she's jordan peterson's dad and
02:21:35 as many people know jordan he's her dad yeah she's had a long issue with  substance addiction and i said
02:21:41 to her you're you know you're most famous for being you know jordan peterson's daughter
02:21:46 you know many people he's changed so many lives around the world he's and he's been such an
02:21:51 enormous influence to me personally that i've started taking benzodiazepines recreationally and she's like oh my god michael is so horrible
02:22:00 yeah you because you pulled me in with this because you're talking i mean you know because he's going through a rough time
02:22:05 now she's going through just everything was just you pulled me in emotionally i was
02:22:12 like this is going to be the sweet mic is going to be just this wonderful and then just bam so that's that's
02:22:20 that's that was  props to you on that it wasn't whatever that is that is an art form
02:22:27  when done well it can be taken too far my criticism is it that feels too good for some people what do you mean  for
02:22:35 oh they're too happy being irreverent because to show that they don't care about anything that's another form of cynicism
02:22:39 though right so i if you because you think it's possible to be a troll and still be the
02:22:47 live life to its highest ideal in the camus sense i try that's kind of my ideal
02:22:54 i i believe it's not i it becomes a drug i feel like that takes you like i think
02:23:01 love ultimately is the way to experience like every moment of every day you don't think that was an
02:23:06 expression of i honestly think let's let's let's split hairs here because i think
02:23:13 there's something of use here i do think that me i'm me being able to make her laugh about this year of hell she was in yeah
02:23:22 does create an element of love and connection between me and her yeah but
02:23:29 i know she would say that yes it wasn't that it was what you said in combination with the sweetness everywhere else the
02:23:39 kindness it's a very subtle thing but like it's like some of the deepest connections we have with others is when we
02:23:46 like mock them lovingly or yes that's correct but like there is stuff there's kindness around that yeah it's
02:23:54 not in words but in life of course subtle things because it creates an error familiarity
02:23:59 being familial like we're through this together like yeah yeah yeah that's missing that's very
02:24:04 difficult to do on the internet i agree with you i agree with you that's why my like my
02:24:09 general approach on the internet is to be  some more like simple less witty
02:24:18 and more like dumbly loving but that's not your core  me yeah but i i could be woody you
02:24:29 can be but i'm saying that's not your core company so i'm just saying you're bad at it but i'm saying that's not
02:24:32 where you go like organically especially with strangers i just feel like nobody's core
02:24:40 competence on the internet is  i guess if you want to bring love to the world nobody's core competence
02:24:48 is given the current platforms nobody's core competence is whit it's very difficult to be witty
02:24:52 on the internet without while still communicating kindness like
02:24:57 i'll give you another example in the same way that you can in physical space i'll give you another example someone
02:25:03 came at me and they were like they gave me a donation people do this all the time and they go
02:25:08 oh like i started reading your books because of my wife and you know now
02:25:14 watch your shows together i keep up the good work and i go what does her boyfriend think
02:25:20 so that is an example of wit and love because that person feels seen i'm acknowledging them yeah i'm also making a joke at their
02:25:27 expense we know it's a joke so i think language is often used in non-literal ways to cue emotional and connectivity
02:25:35 it's difficult but you it's very difficult what you've done is is difficult to accomplish but you've
02:25:40 done it well i mean you do like you did you do been doing these live streams which are nice that
02:25:45 people give you a bunch of money and donations and stuff and then you you'll often like make fun
02:25:50 of certain aspects of their questions and so yeah but it's so it's always wrong that's not from love that is
02:25:53 genuine annoyance because they ask me some really dumb questions but they're still underlying
02:25:59 it's not even like there's a kind person under this that's being communicated that's interesting but
02:26:04 i don't know if i get that from your twitter i know i get that from the video the something about the face something about
02:26:10 like yeah of course it's much harder the more the more data yeah the more easy it is to convey
02:26:15 emotion and subtlety absolutely if you only have literally black and white letters it's gonna be or whatever white
02:26:20 and black if you have night mode it's gonna be a very different it's much more limited information
02:26:25 yeah but this is the fundamental thing is like let's here's another example like if
02:26:30 they had access to my face like a lot of times some people don't know who i am and they come at me call me a nazi
02:26:35 anti-semite right and i start talking about the jews and just how terrible the jews are now
02:26:39 all my audience knows i'm jewish that i went to shiva so they're sitting there laughing because this person is making
02:26:43 ass to themselves that person has no idea but if there was video then they would be like okay wait a
02:26:49 minute something yeah yeah something's up i don't know  i think it's entertaining i think it's fun
02:26:57 but i just i don't think it's scalable and ultimately i'm trying to figure out this whole
02:27:02 trolling thing because i think it's really destructive i've been the outrage mob the outrage mobs
02:27:11 the just the the dynamics of twitter has been really bothering me okay and i've been trying to figure out
02:27:15 if we can try to build an alternative to twitter perhaps or try to encourage
02:27:21 twitter to be better how to have nuanced healthy conversations like the reason i talk about love isn't
02:27:28 just for love's sake it's just a good base from which to have difficult conversations like that's a
02:27:36 good starting point because if you start like i would argue that the kind of conversation you have on twitter
02:27:43 is fun but it might not be a good starting point for a difficult nuanced conversation well i'm not interested in having those
02:27:49 conversations with most people no i know but so i agree with you your point is valid
02:27:55 yes but like i'm saying so if we were trying to have a difficult nuanced conversation about
02:28:00 say race in america or policing is there racism institutional racism of policing okay
02:28:07 there's  the only conversations that have been nuanced about it that i've heard
02:28:14 is in the podcasting medium which is the magic of podcasting which is great but that that's the
02:28:22 downside of podcasting is it's a very small number of people even if it's in the thousands
02:28:28 it's still small and then there's millions of people on social media and they're not having
02:28:33 nuanced conversation at all they're not capable of it that's the difference in you that's
02:28:36 saved their minds i believe they are so that's there's no data that's happening and then both
02:28:41 of us aren't being not scientific you don't have data to support your worldview either you're making the claim
02:28:47 well you are too no i'm not if i'm looking at an object the free the claim that opens my mind well
02:28:56 no what no your claim is that people are fundamentally stupid aren't you a martial artist yes
02:29:04 how does it feel i know you yeah but you really don't think people are deep
02:29:10 down like capable of being intelligent no not at all not not deep down not surface i'm not
02:29:17 joking i'm not being tongue-in-cheek and not being cynical i do not at all at all think they have this capacity
02:29:23 i'm gonna because you're just being so clear about it you're not even i'm gonna be here you know why i here's
02:29:29 here's a here's evidence for my position not proof and this is of course data that is
02:29:34 of little use but it's of interest a lot of times when you have an audience as big as mine and people come at you
02:29:41 not only will people say the same thing the same concept they'll say the same concept in the same way
02:29:47 that is not a mind yeah that's surface evidence you're saying this iceberg looks like this from the surface
02:29:54 yeah i'm saying there's an iceberg there that if challenged can can rise to the occasion of deep thinking
02:30:06 and you're saying nope nope it's just isn't that the russian expression that's ice cream
02:30:15 no not doesn't it mean like no one's there actually i don't know yeah it means like yeah
02:30:28 okay well  so you're challenging me to be a little bit more rigorous i think i'll try i'll not challenge you
02:30:32 anything i'm just saying no not challenging me but like i'm challenging myself based on what you're saying
02:30:37 because i'd like to prove you wrong and find actual yeah data to show you're wrong and i think i can but i would need to 
02:30:47 get that data that's funny you said i think i can when when they were working on my biography ego and hubris
02:30:52 the title i had suggested was the little engine that could but shouldn't and they didn't like it i think that's a
02:31:00 great title it's pretty good yeah speaking of biographies i mean one i read your book or listen to your book
02:31:05 listen to there's an audiobook for you right yeah i did the audio yeah yeah you you read it my goal is yes okay so
02:31:11 this is this is  i didn't do yaron brook's voice in the book i did all the
02:31:15 different voices because he has lisp and i didn't want to sound like i was making fun of him
02:31:21 yeah i i don't remember you reading it but it was i was really enjoyed this yeah no okay it was good it
02:31:26 was like a year a year and a half ago  well let me at a high level see if you can pull this off
02:31:36 if i ask you  what's the book new write about it's about  a group of people who are united
02:31:45 solely by their opposition to progressivism who have little else in common but who are all frequently
02:31:53 caricatured and dismissed by the larger establishment media but you give this kind of story of how
02:32:00 it came to be sure and to me like we're talking about trolls but the internet side of things is quite interesting
02:32:08 so first of all how does alt-right connect so the alt-right is the subset of the new right
02:32:17 which feels that race not racism is the most or one of the most important socio-political issues
02:32:26 are any of those folks like part of the mainstream or worth paying attention to not only by the mainstream
02:32:32 the alt-right yeah by definition they would be part of the mainstream they would not be part of that no they
02:32:36 would not i don't know that any of them well worth is not a position i'm not able to say worth
02:32:45 i'm i would say that it is of use to be familiar with their arguments because to dismiss
02:32:52 any school of thought especially one that has historically gained leverage especially one that has
02:32:57 historically gained leverage in very dark ways especially in america in europe and other places
02:33:03 just to say oh they're racist i don't need to think about them it's it's it doesn't behoove you so what
02:33:11  what lessons do we draw from the the 4chan side of things like the internet side
02:33:18 of the movement tits or get the out can you define every single word hits our breasts
02:33:25 or get the out that's from 4chan okay that's what's  what's it mean oh sometimes like a woman will appear in
02:33:30 4chan and they'll just reply tits or get the out i'm trying to understand what oh oh
02:33:44 i just very slow  so that's okay so that's very disrespectful towards female members of the community
02:33:54 i don't understand there's rules to this community and one of them is  we're not very good with women is
02:33:59 that that's one of those sort of principles it's a principle we're not going to ever get laid that's
02:34:07 the fundamental principle is there we are going to get pics pics sometimes sometimes on the sometimes gtfo
02:34:17 gt okay so is there other actual principles of so like it's it's i from my maybe naive perspective is
02:34:26 they have like the darkest aspects of trolling which is like take nothing serious make a game out of everything that's not
02:34:32 4chan per se one of the things that you will learn 4chan which i think is very healthy is
02:34:38 if you have an idiosocratic or unique worldview or focus on an aspect of history or culture
02:34:43 you'll be able to find like-minded people who you will engage with you and discuss it without being
02:34:50 promptly dismissive that's an ideal that they well it's not ideal it's something that happens a lot now 4chan
02:34:53 is not really like paul as their board with politics but they will
02:34:59 you know get into some like the people there are much more erudite than you think so they do take my my perception was
02:35:05 they take nothing seriously so there's things that they take seriously like discussing ideas i'll give you one example
02:35:11 there was a video someone posted of a girl who put kittens in a bag and threw in a river
02:35:15 and they found out where she was within a day and got her like arrested so yeah they do they take some things
02:35:20 very seriously okay but that's like an extreme that i mean that's good first of all that's
02:35:27 heartwarming that they wouldn't somehow turn that into a thing that feels like more of  what is it
02:35:33 what's the other one 8chan 8 chance twice as good as 4chan yeah that's their slogan
02:35:39 but it feels like they're the kind of community that would take that kitten situation and make a mockery yeah
02:35:46 they're they're a darker than fortune yeah yeah i don't even i'm not allowed to talk
02:35:51 about 16 chan i'm already overwhelmed clearly  by 4chan lingo i'm i have actu i literally wrote
02:35:59 down on my notes like in doing research for this conversation i learned the word pleb and
02:36:09 i wanted to ask you would this pleb mean you know what flood means no i don't what i i saw i mean actually no
02:36:16 i don't you know what a pleb is i just i don't know what a flub is
02:36:23 like a plebiscite or plebeian okay but does it mean something more sophisticated no it's a very
02:36:29 unsophisticated mechanism of being dismissive of like the regular people yeah or someone who comes at me
02:36:37 on twitter okay all right so back to the 4chan alt-right it wasn't  those are very different concepts
02:36:44 don't conflate them but which internet culture was the alt-right born out of
02:36:51  alright was more born of blogs and people had different blogs where they were posting what they called like
02:36:54 racial realism scientific which is scientific racism so-called and
02:36:59 you know breaking down issues from a racialist perspective so that wasn't 4chan is much more  dynamic it's a
02:37:04 message board it's very fluid so it doesn't lend itself to these kind of in-depth analysis of
02:37:11 ideas or history but it spreads them like it it spreads them as memes yeah
02:37:17 and it you know but it's not it's not an essential mechanism of  of the alt-right historical no no no no
02:37:23 no no so it was both mostly about blogs okay so what  what do you make of the psychology of
02:37:29 this kind of world view when you have this goes to your conspiracy theory
02:37:34 subject earlier when you have a little bit of knowledge about something about history that no one's talking
02:37:40 about and there's only one group that is talking about it and they and you have no alternative
02:37:46 answers you're going to be drawn to that group so because issues about race anti-semitism homophobia are so
02:37:53 taboo in our culture understandably there's good reasons if you start putting things like how old
02:37:57 should you be you have sex with kids just have regular conversations eventually some people are
02:38:01 going to start taking some positions you don't like so some things have to be sanctified to some extent
02:38:06 they're the only ones talking about it you're going to be drawn to that subculture and where does the alt-right
02:38:12 stand now i mean i hear that term used so the term has been weaponized by the corporate press
02:38:21 for people that they want to read out of society so it's used both on individual levels like people like gavin mcking
02:38:28 mckingus milo yiannopoulos some others they i mean i think they refer to trump as alt-right
02:38:34 and and you know it's become a slur just like in cell or bot that has become largely removed from its original meaning
02:38:41 do you have a sense that there's still a movement that's all right or like yeah they call themselves now so okay so
02:38:46 there's something called the dissident right and they say we're completely not like the alt-right because the alt-right's a
02:38:51 b and c and we're bcd there's a huge overlap it's very much the same people is
02:38:58 there intellectuals that still represent some awesome aspect of the movement
02:39:03 i mean sure are you tracking this not not that much anymore i think they've they're i don't find
02:39:08 it particularly as now that the book's done you know my i'm looking more into
02:39:14 history from my next book you mentioned communism i'm going to talk a lot about the cold war
02:39:21 so this kind of stuff has largely fallen away from my radar to some extent and they've also been
02:39:26 the the it's been a very effective movement to get them marginalized and silenced so they're not as as deep as of a
02:39:33 concern in terms of concern or not just their impact on size much less
02:39:40 yeah so as a troll on twitter yeah in the best sense of the word what do you make 
02:39:47 of canceled culture i think it's maoism it's i mean the corporate america has done a far better job of implementing that
02:39:52 wasn't that a communist party ever could you had this meeting not that long ago from i think it was
02:39:56 northwestern university law school where everyone on the call got up and said that they were racist i mean this
02:40:01 is something that legally you should be very averse to saying even if it were true
02:40:06 and it's this kind of concept of getting up and confessing your sins before the collective is something completely um
02:40:13 are they sorry they admitted this of themselves yeah they were like because they're saying because they're white
02:40:17 they're inherently racist so my name's john i'm a racist my name is this i'm a racist it was it was  you hear it and
02:40:22 you're like okay this is looney tunes so you're saying that wow that's that that's so much you took a step
02:40:28 further so you're saying there's like a a deep underlying force but it says cancer culture it's not just
02:40:33 some kind of mob but it's not some at all it's a it's a systemic organized movement 
02:40:40 being used for very nefarious purposes and to dominate you know an entire nation
02:40:46 how do we fight it because i sense it inside you know i used to defend academia more because um
02:40:58 i i still do to some extent it's a nuanced discussion because you know like folks like jordan peterson
02:41:06 and a lot of people that kind of attack academia they refer they really are talking about
02:41:11 gender studies at certain departments and me from mit you know it's the university of science and engineering and
02:41:19 the the faculty there really don't think about these issues or haven't traditionally thought about
02:41:26 it's beginning to even infiltrate there it's the you know it's starting to infiltrate engineering and sciences outside of
02:41:33 biology yeah like let's put biology with the gender studies like i'm talking about sciences
02:41:38 that really don't have anything to do with gender  it's starting to infiltrate
02:41:45 and it worries me i don't know exactly why like i don't know exactly what the negative
02:41:50 effect there would be except it feels like it's anti-intellectual oh yes of course and i'm not sure what
02:41:58 to  because on the surface it feels like a path towards progress
02:42:07 at first when you when i'm like zoomed out you know just like like squinting my eyes the you know not
02:42:13 even in detail looking at things but when i actually joined the conversation to like listen in
02:42:18 the conversation on quote-unquote diversity it quickly makes me realize that there's no interest in um
02:42:30 in making a better world no no it's about domination it's it's about getting yeah it's a way for
02:42:37 if you are a lowest status white person using anti-racism is the only mechanism you will have to feel superior to
02:42:43 another human being so it's very useful for them in terms of fighting it one of my suggestions has
02:42:51 been to seize all university endowments which are the crystallization of privilege and distribute that money as reparations
02:42:58 so be very effective by turning two populations against each other and strongly diminishing the
02:43:03 university's intellectual hegemony  the universities are absolutely the real villains in the picture thankfully
02:43:09 they're also the least prepared to be aggressed upon and after the
02:43:15 government and the corporate press they are the last leg of the stool and they don't know what's coming and
02:43:21 it's gonna get ugly and i cannot wait so this is where you and i disagree part one yeah we disagree
02:43:28 in a sense that you want to dismantle broken institutions i don't think they're broke
02:43:33 they're working like by design i think for over 100 years they have been talking about bringing
02:43:38 the next generation of american leaders which is code for promulgating an ideology
02:43:45 based on egalitarian principles and world domination let me try to express my lived experience okay sure okay
02:43:55 my experience at mit is that there's a bunch of administrators that are the bureaucracy
02:44:03 sure that i can i can say this is the nice thing about having a podcast i don't give a damn is they're
02:44:07 pretty useless in fact they get in the way but there's faculty there's professors
02:44:15 that aren't incredible they're incredible human beings that all they do all day they're
02:44:22 too busy but for the most part what they do all day is just like continually pursue
02:44:27 different little trajectories of curiosities in the in the various
02:44:33 avenues of science that they work on and as a side effect of that they mentor a group of students sometimes a large
02:44:42 group of students and also teach courses and they're constantly sharing their passion with others and
02:44:48 my experience is it's just a bunch of people who are curious about engineering and math and science
02:44:54 chemistry artificial intelligence computer science what i'm most familiar with and there's never this feeling of mit
02:45:03 being broken somehow like this kind of feeling like if i talk to you just now or like eric weinstein there's a feeling like
02:45:12 stuff is on fire right there's something broken  but when i'm in in the system  especially before the kovid before
02:45:20 this kind of tension everything was great there was no discussion of
02:45:26 even diversity all that kind of stuff the the toxic stuff that we might be talking about right now
02:45:31 none of that was happening it was a bunch of people just in love with  cool ideas
02:45:36 exploring ideas being curious and learning and all that kind of stuff so i don't my my sense of academia
02:45:44 was this is the place where kids in their 20s 30s and 40s can continue the playground of science and having fun it's
02:45:53 if you destroy academia if you destroy universities like you're suggesting kind of lessening
02:45:57 their power you take away the playground from these kids to to
02:46:02 to play it's going to be hard for you to tell me that i'm anti-playground yeah well i guess i'm saying you're on
02:46:08 top certain kinds of playgrounds which is yeah the ones that have the broken glass on the floor yeah i am against those
02:46:14 kinds of playgrounds no no you're you're you're yes no you see that you listen
02:46:24 no you no you wait yeah i i i would say you're being the watchful mother who the one kid who
02:46:29 hurt themselves in the glass one kid it's an intelligent it's generation after generation i'm not a
02:46:33 watchful mother i'm the guy with the flamethrower no i i i understand that but you're using the one
02:46:42 kid who was always kind of like weird gender studies department  that that hurt themselves on the glass
02:46:49 as opposed to the people who are like obviously having fun in the playground and not  playing by the glass the
02:46:56 broken glass and they're just i mean to me some of the best innovations in science happen
02:47:03 in universities okay you can't forget that universities don't have this liberal like politics literally in
02:47:14 every conversation until this year until this this year there's something happening but  every conversation i've ever had
02:47:20 nothing to do with politics would never trump never came up none of that ever come up nothing like
02:47:26 all this kind of idea that there's liberal all that that that's in the humanities yeah but do you think mit massachusetts
02:47:33 into technology might be a little bit of an outlier yeah there probably is yeah
02:47:39 but i i don't i honestly don't think when people criticize academia they're looking at
02:47:45  they're in fact also picking the outliers which is they're picking some of the quote unquote's strongest gender studies
02:47:52 department this is nonsensical when i was a bucknell i was a college student we had to take
02:47:57 you know we had a bunch of electives and i want to take a class on individual american individualism one of the texts
02:48:02 of the five that we had to read was birth of a nation the movie
02:48:09 about the clan so there's no department where these people are not thorough going hardcore
02:48:18 ideologues  this is not a gender cities that's the humanity fine all the humanity it's not just
02:48:22 gender studies okay fine i can give you history english yes all of them
02:48:28 every university as you know has it mandatory in the curriculum they have to take a bunch of these propaganda classes
02:48:37 i look forward to youtube comments because you're being more eloquent and you're speaking to the thing that a
02:48:42 lot of people agree with and i'm being my usual slow self and people are going to say not very nice things
02:48:48 about me don't say anything that nice about lex okay please let me try to just just shoot up
02:48:52 a school that would be preferable there he goes again only the teachers go to the
02:48:58 darkest possible place the sunshine baby schools that's where everyone goes to be happy playgrounds
02:49:04 there he goes dark ear just dives right in like it just go dark and then just comes back off to the surface
02:49:11 not to feel you're probably a figment of my generation i'm not even having this
02:49:22 podcast well after 18 red bulls i'm surprised you could see anything this is like fight club red bull gives
02:49:27 you delirious yeah  i got into it at norton yesterday on twitter oh really yeah as he  like the
02:49:36 rest of the celebrities yeah he's like oh this is an existential threat to america trump's a fascist he's
02:49:41 delegitimizing the oval office i said what an odd endorsement of trump well you should have went with bad pit
02:49:47 he might have a different opinion that's spike reference okay this conversation is over it's interesting i'd like to
02:49:55 draw a line between science and engineering and science not including like the biological aspect the the parts of biology that touch
02:50:06 and humanities and biology like i feel because  humanities if you just look at the percentage of universities it's still
02:50:14 a minority percentage and i would actually draw different i think they serve very different
02:50:20 purposes sure and that's actually a broken part about universities about like
02:50:27 why why is some of the best research in the world done at universities that doesn't like there might be a different like mit
02:50:34 it feels weird that a faculty yeah these are conceptually different things like we do research and we teach why is this
02:50:39 the same yeah it feels weird but that's just but but i'm also i'm coming to like the defense
02:50:45 of the engineers that never talk about i'm not like like my mind isn't i'm not like deluded
02:50:52 or something where i'm i'm not seeing the the house on fire i'm just saying i am seeing the house because i also lived in
02:50:58 harvard square i'm seeing harvard but when you see the tanks coming they're coming next
02:51:03 they're gonna be so beautiful i'm gonna it'll be like the american beauty the plastic bag i just
02:51:07 won't be able to stop crying because it'll be so beautiful yeah thanks i could i can already i can
02:51:11 already see it but the but the engineering departments were like i believe
02:51:18 that the elon musks of the world that the the like the innovation that will make a better world
02:51:24 is happening and like let's not burn that down because it has nothing to do with any
02:51:28 like they're all like sitting quietly in while like well the the humanities and all these kind of
02:51:35 diversity programs they're not having any of these discussions listen my soviet brother you both know
02:51:40 we both know that ice water runs in our veins so if you're calling for mercy that is not how i'm wired
02:51:47 but i'm not closing the door yeah i'm actually realizing now so for people listening to this i'll
02:51:52 probably prepend this and saying that i'm even slower than usual i didn't sleep last night
02:51:59 but i feel i'm actually realizing just how slow i am and how much preparation i need to do in
02:52:05 if i would like to defend aspects of academia i better come prepared i don't think you need to defend them i think i'm
02:52:13 granting you your premise freely no you might be okay i don't think the the world is that
02:52:17 like actually you just defeat your own argument because you because it is not at all
02:52:22 have to be the way that a phenomenal research institution like mit which no one disputes has to also be an educational establishment
02:52:30 these two things are not at all necessarily interconnected but then you have to offer a way
02:52:36 to separate correct but like i'm not a big fan everybody's different but i'm not a fan
02:52:41 of criticizing institutions without offering sure a way to change and especially when i'm like
02:52:47 have ability to change i'd like to yeah i'd like to offer a path like what if they were in students they
02:52:52 were all mentor like  like men like what's the opposite of a mentor mentee protege what's the term when you're like
02:53:00 just when you work at a place like interns not an intern something i'm thinking of but anyway like basically
02:53:05 they're working there instead of going to college there it's possible but it's going against tradition and so you
02:53:11 have to build new institutions and  and then have these engineers building new things that's crazy
02:53:16 yeah these research engineers where they're going to be building things well one of the things because
02:53:20 you're kind of you know apprentice that's the way i was looking at apprentice which is ironic
02:53:24 we're talking about trump and we couldn't think of the word apprentice ah very yeah well done
02:53:30 we should both be fired yeah there you go these russian jews so quick with their wit okay
02:53:37  but the the thing is you're a fan of freedom i am and there's there is  intellectual freedom
02:53:44 people this is what i was trying to articulate i'm failing to articulate but there truly is complete intellectual
02:53:51 freedom within universities on topics of science and engineering i believe you
02:53:58 yeah i agree with you i don't think it's going to take much persuasion but i'll give you an example
02:54:03 when that i i'm sure you know more details about this than i do when that  scientist
02:54:10 engineered that probe to land on that comet and the articles written because this hawaiian shirt he was wearing had like
02:54:16 pinup girls on it which i think is female student episode frame or something where's his ex-girlfriend and he had to apologize
02:54:23 this is what rand was talking about yeah that the great accomplishments of men have to say i'm sorry
02:54:30 to the lowest most despicable disgusting people yeah i don't know you know let me bring this case up because i think about this
02:54:39  this might not mean much to you but it means a lot to a certain aspect of the computer science community
02:54:44 there's a guy named richard stallman i don't know if you know who that is no he's the founder of the
02:54:51 free software foundation he's like a big linux he's one of the key people in the history of computer science
02:54:56 one of those open source people right but he is like i believe he's the one of the hardcore
02:55:01 ones which is like so all software should be free okay okay so very interesting personality very key
02:55:08 person in the new just like linus torvald key person so but he also kind of speaks his mind
02:55:16 okay and on a certain chain of conversations at mit that was leaked to the new york times then was published
02:55:27 led him to be fired or pushed out of mit recently maybe a year ago and i always sat weird with me so what
02:55:35 happened is there's a few undergraduate students that called marvin minsky not sure if you're
02:55:43 familiar who that is i've heard the name he's one of the seminal people in artificial intelligence
02:55:48 they they said that they called him a rapist because  he met with jeffrey epstein and jeff  free epstein solicited
02:55:59  two these are the best facts known to me that i'm aware of that's what was stated on the chain is he solicited a 17
02:56:05 but it might have been an 18 year old girl to come up to marvin minsky and ask him if he wanted to have sex
02:56:13 with her so jeffrey epstein told the girl yeah she came up to marvin miske who was at
02:56:20 that time is i think seven years old and his wife was there too marvin mink's wife and he said
02:56:27 no or like you know awkwardly yeah so thank you that was stated in the email thread
02:56:38 as marvin participating in  sexual assault and rape of this  unwilling sexual assault and it was
02:56:46 called rape  of this person right of this woman that propositioned him and then
02:56:54 richard stallman who's he's kind of known for this he's very he's you make fun of me being
02:57:01 a robot but he's kind of like a debugger he's like well that sentence is not what you said is not correct
02:57:08 so he like corrected the person  basically made it seem like the the use of the word rape is not correct
02:57:16 because that's not the definition of rape and then he was attacked for saying oh now you're playing with definitions of
02:57:21 rape rapist rape is the answer right and then that was leaked in him defending so the way he was
02:57:29 leaked it was reported as him defending rape that's the way it was reported
02:57:39 and he was pushed out and he didn't really give a damn it's he doesn't seem to make a big deal
02:57:45 out of it he just left he made an example of him they made an example and that and
02:57:51 everyone was afraid to defend him so like there's a bunch of faculty one dude you're from the soviet union
02:57:55 doesn't this hit close to home for you i don't know what to think of it it hits
02:58:03 close to home but it was basically at least at mit now mit is such a light place with this
02:58:08 it's not common at mit but it was like 18 19 year old kids undergraduate kids with this kind of
02:58:15 fire in them there's just very few of them but they're the ones that raise all this kind of fuss
02:58:23 and the entirety of the administration all the faculty are afraid to stand up to them
02:58:29 it's so interesting to me like i don't know if i should be afraid of that you don't think you should be afraid so
02:58:34 someone who's trying to be specific when it comes to charges of violent assault is looking for that clarity can get
02:58:40 their life  other search engines let me give you more context there's a little bit more context to
02:58:47 richard stallman which is he was also a rapist no he left out that part he liked raping people but he's had a history
02:58:56 through his life  of you know every once in a while wearing the hawaiian shirt with like he would make
02:59:05 he's a fat  sorry but he's a fat unattractive he like what trump referred to the the yeah
02:59:11 the guy in the basement in the basement that's richard okay i love you is is you know he is
02:59:15 what he is peop you know people he like he would eat his own 
02:59:20 he would pick skin from his feet and lectures and just eat it okay yeah this video is him doing that
02:59:25 i'm not joking he must really behind the spectrum then yeah okay yeah and
02:59:33 so and you know  he i think this  and his office he adore he wrote something like 
02:59:42  like hacker  plus plus lover of ladies or something like that like
02:59:49 something kind of yeah yeah yeah so professional yeah unprofessional and a little creepy yeah no that's fair
02:59:55 so he was also so they're looking for an excuse to get rid of him it sounds like i know he was just
03:00:02 who's they the administration yeah probably probably a lot of times what people don't realize you know this would be my
03:00:08 defensive cancer culture a lot of times when someone gets fired over something like this yeah this isn't
03:00:13 why this is just giving them cover to get rid of them without getting a lawsuit yeah but it's still
03:00:20 so i think i guess what i'm trying to communicate it feels a little weird and creepy and he may not be the the best for the community
03:00:29 but that's not necessarily the message it's sent to the rest of the community the message is sent to the rest of the
03:00:35 community that being clear about words or the usage of the word rape
03:00:41 is  like you should call everything rape that's that's that's basically the message you
03:00:46 send or you should call that we say rape rape it's about submission i think i'm you'd be very happy to know that there's a lot
03:00:53 of people and she's very crucified this like betsy devos the president's department of education
03:00:58 who are aware of this they are aware that this completely contradicts due process  they're aware
03:01:02 of how a rape accusation is something not to be taken seriously but because it's not to
03:01:07 be taken seriously it has to be also taken seriously another context that you know once that word is around a
03:01:13 male this can ruin his entire life and that's that that's the sticky thing of the word
03:01:21 like i like i think about this a lot that like how would i defend it if somebody
03:01:28 like i've never i can honestly say i've never done anything close to creepy in my life
03:01:34 like  with like with women but you wouldn't know it if you had right that's the thing a lot of these creepy
03:01:39 guys don't think they're creepy they think they're being cute yeah but i'm just telling you even like
03:01:46 fine let's say right let's say i'm not aware of it but the point that i am aware of is that somebody could
03:01:52 just completely make something up correct yeah yeah yeah yeah okay and like how what do
03:01:56 what would i say no he denied the charges there's an article around everything you did supposedly and
03:02:00 then goes  mr freeman denied the charges yeah but what creeps me out
03:02:05 that happened can i interrupt there is zora neal hurston is one of my favorite writers she's from the harlem renaissance
03:02:10 she wrote their eyes were watching god a couple of other books she was just an amazing amazing figure
03:02:16 her biography is called wrapped in rainbows it's just a masterpiece i like i think i read it one day
03:02:20 can't recommend her enough fascinating fascinating woman during the 30s i think it was her 1940 she was out
03:02:26 of the country she was accused of molesting a teenage boy she wasn't in america this could be proven
03:02:35 so there's is absolutely false not even a question she was indicted and she wanted to kill herself because
03:02:41 she's like people are going to see these things and they're going to think maybe there's
03:02:46 some truth to it maybe it's voluntary what they're just going to and and you could understand what should be suicidal
03:02:50 over this so yeah this is this is something that's been going on for a long time and in
03:02:56 the fact that it's becoming i do agree it's important i know a lot of women who have been sexually assaulted more
03:03:01 than i i'm happy that i know and if i know that many that means there's more so i i don't
03:03:07 i think it's it's a good idea that they feel seen that they don't feel wounded they don't
03:03:11 feel damaged or they can talk to their friends and i'm like man this sucks is happening to
03:03:15 you and and i don't think you're a i don't think you're asking for it i think you feel violated i think it's gross
03:03:21 talk to me like i i do think that that's important and i also think it's important though like when things get
03:03:27 kind of in a frenzy that a lot of people like yeah i also had something happen and very
03:03:32 quickly the line between he grabbed my boob and he violently raped me i don't think these two things are the same at all i
03:03:38 think they're both sexual assault but in terms of what someone can deal with the next day the next month 10
03:03:43 years later i i don't think there's similar scenarios yeah i had juanita broderick on my show
03:03:50 and hearing her talk about you know her alleged rape by bill clinton was very disturbing for me very
03:03:56 disturbing to hear because it was like half an hour so you know we think of these things and think okay
03:04:02 hold her down blah blah yeah and then it's done half an hour when just even someone physically holding you down for
03:04:07 half an hour like not even a sexual assault yeah like that's traumatic yeah you think am i your brain's gonna
03:04:13 think am i gonna die when i zoom out i think the ultimately this is gonna lead to a better world
03:04:21 like empowering women to speak to those kinds of experiences the benefit of it outweighs
03:04:29 the the issue is whenever people are given a weapon some are going to use it in nefarious
03:04:34 ways and that's the lesson of history males when males females whites blacks children adults
03:04:40 when people are given a mechanism to execute power over others some are going to use it can i ask you
03:04:45 for a therapy thing sure untrolling in a sense  because i mentioned
03:04:54 somebody making up something about me i feel because i wear my heart on my sleeve i'm not good with these attacks like
03:05:03 i've been attacked recently just being called a fraud and all that kind of stuff just light stuff like i
03:05:09 haven't you know it was like it hurt okay well let me help you maybe it's because i'm a
03:05:15 new yorker no i'm serious here's why in new york a lot of times you'll be walking with
03:05:23 your friend and a homeless person will come up to you and start yelling things at you your reaction
03:05:29 isn't in those circumstances let me hear this out your reaction is physical safety and
03:05:34 getting away now it's not impossible that that homeless person
03:05:39 is actually saying the truth this happened to my a friend of mine she this guy wasn't homeless and he's
03:05:46 walking down the street on smith street and he's just talking out loud and he goes why they call them hipsters what
03:05:51 are they hip to and she chuckles and he goes what are you laughing at fatso
03:05:57 you start something i'll finish it yeah and she she just couldn't move yeah and it's like it's made a problem
03:06:03 because that's the first thing he went to and there's i don't know that i have any advice but when you hear something like this
03:06:11 this is i think you need to be better in terms of boundaries i think you should not perceive this as
03:06:16 a fellow human but as a crazy homeless person because if this fellow human if i thought that
03:06:23 you were a fraud in some context that's a very weird word to use because fraudulent podcaster
03:06:29 these are real mics but if i was a scientist or human sure but i would ask myself is
03:06:34 this person in a position to make this judgment or are they backing it up
03:06:39 are they saying here your conclusions were wrong here's some mistakes in your data and you can engage with them on ideas
03:06:46 but whenever someone uses a word to entirely dismiss your life without having the knowledge of your
03:06:52 life you do not have to take that seriously i appreciate that kind of idea but some things aren't about data like you
03:07:01 know i i see myself as a fraud often and it's it's more psychology of it if i can reduce something to reason
03:07:12 i can probably be fine my worry is the same as the worry of  like teenage girls that get bullied online
03:07:17 it's like when i'm being open and fragile on the internet it affects me in a way where i can't the
03:07:24 reason doesn't help so it helps me you don't block people enough i'm very happy with the blocking
03:07:28 no i so yeah i'm very heavy i block i it's healthy progressive banality i
03:07:34 block immediately i also think time is going to help i don't think you're
03:07:39 like you didn't grow up wanting to be a podcaster right that wasn't your aspiration so in some sense you are going to feel
03:07:44 like a fraud because you're like what i don't have any training for this i have a training for a scientist
03:07:47 i can talk about artificial intelligence for literally hours but in terms of this like i don't know what i'm doing i'm
03:07:51 kind of so when they call you a fake it's like yeah you're kind of right because like i
03:07:58 i did kind of stumble into this and this is not my pedigree so i think that kind of probably speaks
03:08:03 to you on some level well but they're they're attacking not the podcasting thing but more like the same
03:08:08 thing people call elon musk fraud too which guy that that's the way i rationalize it like
03:08:13 well if they're calling him a fraud and they're calling me a fraud that like even if you have rockets that
03:08:20 go into like if you successfully have rockets  landing back on earth usable rockets
03:08:28 you're still being called a fraud then it's okay not necessarily it could be that he's not a fraud you really are
03:08:36 that's but it's not resonating with you because your brain knows the logic so you can right
03:08:42 but  yeah yeah but i don't know this whole trolling thing you seem to be
03:08:48 much better at seeing it as a game you know why because you are under the delusion that every human
03:08:57 being is capable of intelligent reasoned decisions still think i'm right and i perceive them
03:09:02 as literally animals so when a dog starts barking all it's saying is that the dog is
03:09:07 agitated and this is not going to change my life one iota other than crossing the street perhaps
03:09:12 yeah i'm going to prove you wrong one but if i don't i'll prove you wrong okay i'll bring the data
03:09:22 and they'd be like you're right i have the receipt i have the receipts okay so we mentioned camus oh yeah i
03:09:29 love him is there this is this is this is a question that people
03:09:36 like love when i ask of really smart people well it is love no  what  what books let's say three
03:09:46 books if you can  think of them technical fiction philosophical would you 
03:09:52 had a big impact on you or would you recommend to others sure  the machiavellians by james burnham
03:09:58  this is a book about how politics works in reality as opposed to how people imagine it working mentis moldbug
03:10:05 who's a figure in these circles who's respected by a lot of people i was giving a talk and there was a
03:10:10 bunch of panelists and we were asked what book would you recommend i said the machiavellians
03:10:16 independently of me that was the book he had recommended it's out of print it's hard to find but that would be
03:10:21 one is that his book or no james burnham 1941 i think so  can you pause on the mulches
03:10:27 what's that it's just a small bug that's a code name right like that guy named that guy's dependent curtis jarvin
03:10:34 it's his real name he's in he swims in your circles which he doesn't kind of progress he's
03:10:39 originally programmed yeah he comes up as a person that i should talk with or i should know about but
03:10:46 then i read a few of his things and they seem quite dangerous they're very long and verbose but i
03:10:52 think he's an amazing thinker yeah but he's the one who had the idea of sending the tanks to harvard yard
03:11:00 but doesn't he have like  he has some radical view i forget what they are very radical views yeah he
03:11:03 wants a military coup but you're saying he's a serious thinker this
03:11:11 is worthy  of not worthy i don't know that you would enjoy having a conversation with him i think a lot of
03:11:16 people enjoy seeing it happen but i think it'd be a lot of talking past each other and and it would be interesting what do you
03:11:24 do okay what do you agree what do you disagree i agree with him that politics has to be
03:11:29 looked at objectively and without kind of an emotional connection to different schools i talk about him a
03:11:36 lot in my book on the new right disagree i don't think a military coup is a good idea  he's he doesn't think
03:11:44 anarchism is stable i disagree i mean me and him i did his live stream with him we just dorked out a lot
03:11:51 about history and like you know people who've fallen in the memory hall so i mean he's got a lot of writing
03:11:58 so so you know the sense i got from him was that if i talk with him a lot of people would be upset with me for giving
03:12:05 him a platform yeah i think he's on that edge where they want to read him out of
03:12:11 what is acceptable discourse what's his most controversial i mean you can mention the tanks is that
03:12:16 the most controversial viewpoint does he have a race thing no he's the the alt-right doesn't particularly like
03:12:23 him in many ways because he's not a big on the race thing i don't know what would be his most controversial view
03:12:30   to be honest i think because he is radical in terms of his analysis of culture anytime someone's a radical that
03:12:36 is dangerous because it's dangerous okay book  so that's one the headlines ahead which is a i would say that
03:12:46 shrug no if and if you read atlas shrug before reading the fountain head you're doing yourself an enormous disservice
03:12:49 don't you dare do it on the philosophical because every novel every every level
03:12:54 fountain head's a better novel fountainhead's superfluous if you read out the shrug first
03:12:59 fountain heads about psychology and ethics  it does not have to do with her politics other than its implications
03:13:06 so it's by far the superior book the third one oh this is a good one question let me
03:13:11 see what i there's so many good books out there that i love i i'm going to this is not really my
03:13:17 third choice but i'll throw it out there because i this is such an important world view
03:13:22 especially people on the right are you virtue signaling no this is counter signaling
03:13:28 thaddeus russell's book a renegade history of the united states his thesis is that it's the degenerates
03:13:36 that give us all freedom and things like prostitutes things like madams things like slaves
03:13:42 things like immigrants because they were so low status they could get away with things that then people who are higher
03:13:48 status demanded and so on and so forth so i think that thesis and it really has extreme um
03:13:54 consequences in  thinking and no john jonathan height the righteous mind
03:14:03 that's those are the four is that his best i haven't read that was four but of course forget that
03:14:11 we'll put we'll put height in there you would  no forget that is this those are the three
03:14:19 so we talked about love let me ask you the other question i'm obsessed with are you 
03:14:27 do you ponder your own mortality i do a lot especially now that i'm an uncle especially now that i have like these younger
03:14:34 people that i mentor i was just yesterday  my friend john gergis who did my theme song for my podcast who did the
03:14:41 book cover for dear reader who's like the most talented person i know his song came on the ipod at the gym
03:14:46 and i almost messaged him i go you know one day one of us is going to bury the other and it's going to be really sad
03:14:51 and i thought about that and it was kind of like oh man that's really going to suck and you know i don't know which
03:14:57 scenario would be better like i will be very just sad if he's gone i'm sure he'll be very sad if i'm gone
03:15:02 i mean what are you are you afraid of it no  you know  rand had this quote
03:15:07 about how  i won't die the world will end so i've had enough experiences that i am i i've
03:15:17 really at this point and everything's icing on that cake so if you if i were to kill you at the
03:15:22 end of this podcast it would feel painless that would be okay yeah
03:15:27 you know why does anyone know you're here by the way you know why i'll ask you for a friend
03:15:33 here's why there's that wit say that for twitter likes did they call you sasha no i'm  no sure
03:15:43 oh that's my sister's husband okay so here's why i strongly believe and this is a very kind of jewish
03:15:50 perspective that you just have to leave the world a little bit better than you found it that all you could do is
03:15:54 move the needle a little and one of the things i set out to do with dear reader my book on north korea
03:16:00 i said i was at a point in my career where i could do something to make a difference instead of just writing like
03:16:04 co-authoring books with celebrities which i'm very proud of but you know are neither here nor there
03:16:09 and i thought all right i know how to tell stories i know how to inform people and 110 people
03:16:13 if i move the needle in america who cares we got it really good here if i move the needle in north korea a
03:16:19 little bit the cost benefits through the roof i never thought of that actually i never thought of d reader from that perspective
03:16:27 so when i set out to write it i'm like okay what can i do i'm not gonna be able to liberate the north korean regime what i
03:16:33 can do is the camera right now is focused on at the time kim jong-il now kim jong-un
03:16:38 and i can do just this just this a little bit and i go behind that guy who you think is funny clown there's
03:16:59 about north korea in terms of look at those silly buffoons to those poor people so the fact that that
03:17:04 little thing i can say with a straight face i did doesn't make me a great person
03:17:11 but it does make me someone who if i have to go tomorrow i can say i did a little bit to make the
03:17:17 world a better place what do you think is the meaning of life i think the meaning of life is
03:17:28 why are we here oh well that i'm a camus person so i'll give the kamu answer so there's
03:17:33 two types of people thanks thanks for relating to the audience one zero zero one two two
03:17:48 down vote what kind of radical freak is this lex so and i use this example of my
03:17:53 forthcoming book you go into a countryside a mountainside and you see a blank canvas
03:18:00 on an easel and one kind of mentality goes this is it's just a blank canvas this is stupid
03:18:04 this is what am i looking at and the other type goes what a great opportunity i'm in this beautiful space i have this
03:18:11 entire canvas to paint i could do anything i want with it so i am very much of that type 2 person
03:18:20 and i i hope others start to think of life in that way you and i have both been more successful than we
03:18:25 expected to especially growing up and in ways we did not expect and when you're young
03:18:33 you are so intent on driving the car and after a certain point you realize it's not about driving the cars you're being
03:18:37 a surfer that you can only control this little board and you have no idea where the
03:18:41 waves will take you and sometimes you're gonna fall down and something's gonna suck and you're gonna swallow some salt
03:18:46 water but at a certain point you stop trying to drive and you're like this is freaking awesome
03:18:49 and i have no idea where it's going to go beautifully put i know i speak for a lot of people
03:18:58 first of all everyone loves the game you play on the internet it's fun you make the world not everyone
03:19:06 they came for me hard but it makes the world seem fun and especially in this dark time
03:19:12 it's  it's much appreciated and we can't wait till the next book and the menu to come and to hopefully
03:19:18 many more joe rogan appearances you guys do some great magic together that's you  yeah you're you're one of my
03:19:26 favorite guests on this show so i can't wait especially if you can make it before the election thanks so much for making today happen
