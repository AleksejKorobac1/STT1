00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Ray Dalio he's the founder co-chairman and Co chief investment officer of
00:00:08 Bridgewater associates one of the world's largest and most successful investment firms that is famous for the
00:00:14 principles of radical truth and transparency that underlies culture Ray is one of the wealthiest people in the
00:00:22 world with ideas that extend far beyond the specifics of how he made that wealth his ideas that are applicable to
00:00:29 everyone are brilliantly summarized in his book principles there are also even further condensed on several other
00:00:36 platforms including YouTube where for example the 30 minute video titled how the economic machine works is one of the
00:00:44 best educational videos I personally have ever seen on YouTube once again you may have noticed that the people I've
00:00:51 been speaking with are not just computer scientists but philosophers mathematicians writers psychologists
00:00:57 physicists economists investors and soon much more to me AI is much bigger than deep learning bigger than computing it
00:01:06 is our civilizations journey into understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in the machine
00:01:13 that journey includes the mechanisms of our economy of our politics and the leaders that shape the future of both

00:02:33 donated money is used to maximum effectiveness when you get cash app from the App Store or Google Play and use
00:02:42 code Lex podcast you get ten dollars in cash app will also donate ten dollars the first which again is an organization
00:02:48 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world and now here's my
00:02:56 conversation with Ray Dalio truth or more precisely an accurate understanding of reality is the
00:03:02 essential foundation of any good outcome I believe you've said that let me ask an absurd sounding question at the - South
00:03:13 Col level so what is truth when you're trying to do something different than everybody else is doing and perhaps
00:03:18 something that has not been done before how do you accurately analyze the situation how do you accurately discover
00:03:27 the truth the nature of things almost the way you're asking the question implies that truth and newness have
00:03:35 nothing or almost at odds and I just want to say that I don't think that that's true right so what I mean by
00:03:43 truth truth is you know was a reality how does the reality work and so if you're doing something new that has
00:03:49 never been done before which is exciting and I like to do the way that you would start with that is experimenting on what
00:03:58 are the realities and the premises that you're using on that and how to stress test those types of things I think what
00:04:04 you're talking about is instead the fact of how do you deal with something that's never been done before and deal with the
00:04:12 Associated probabilities and so I I think in that don't let something that's never been done before stand in the way
00:04:19 of you doing that particular thing you have a because almost the only way that you understand what truth is is through
00:04:28 experimentation and so when you go out and experiment you're going to learn a lot more about what truth is but the
00:04:35 essence of what I'm saying is that when you take a look at that use truth that find out what the realities are as a
00:04:43 foundation do the independent thinking do the experimentation to find out what's true and change and keep going
00:04:52 after that so I think that the way that when you're thinking about it the way you're thinking about it that almost
00:04:59 implies that you're you're letting people almost say that they're reliant on what's been discovered before to find
00:05:07 out what's true and what's been discovered before is often not true right conventional view of what what is
00:05:17 true is very often wrong it'll go in ups and downs and you know I mean there are fads and okay this thing it goes this
00:05:23 way and that way and so definitions of truths that are conventional are not the thing to go by how do you know the thing
00:05:32 that has been done before it might succeed its to do you whatever homework that you have in order to try to get a
00:05:41 foundation and then to go into worlds of not knowing and you go into the world of not knowing but not stupidly not naively
00:05:50 you know you go into that world of not knowing and then you do experimenting and you learn what truth is and what's
00:05:58 possible through that process I describe it as a five step process the first step is you go after your goals the second
00:06:04 step is you identify the problems that stand in the way of you getting to your goals the third step is you diagnose
00:06:10 those to get at the root cause of those then the fourth step is then now that you know the exact truth calls you get
00:06:17 you design a way to get around those and then you follow through and do the designs you set out to do and it's the
00:06:25 experimentation I think that what happens to people mostly is that they try to decide whether they're going to
00:06:32 be successful or not ahead of doing it and they don't know how to do the process well because the
00:06:39 nature of your questions are along those lines like how do you know well you don't know but a practical person who is
00:06:47 also used to making dreams happen knows how to do that process I've given personality tests to shapers so the
00:06:54 person what I mean by a shaper is a person who can take something from visual as visualization they have an
00:07:03 audacious goal and then they go from visualization to actualization building it out that includes Elon Musk I gave
00:07:10 him the personality tests I'm giving it to Bill Gates and give it to many many such shapers and they know that process
00:07:19 that I'm talking about they experience it which is a process essentially of knowing how to go from an audacious
00:07:27 but not in a ridiculous way not a dream and then to do that learning along the way that allows them in a very practical
00:07:36 way to learn very rapidly as they're moving toward that goal so the the call to adventure the adventure starts not
00:07:43 trying to analyze the probabilities of the situation but using what instinct how do you dive in so let's talk what it
00:07:54 is it is being a it's simultaneously being a dreamer and a realist it's to know how to do that well the pole comes
00:08:02 from a pole to adventure for whatever reason I can't tell you how much of its genetics and how much its environment
00:08:11 but there's a early on it's exciting that notion is exciting being creative is exciting and so one feels that then
00:08:20 one gets in the habit of doing that okay how do I know how do I learn very well and then how do I imagine and then how
00:08:29 do I experiment to go from that imagination so it's that process that one and then one more one does it the
00:08:40 one more the better one becomes that you mentioned shapers you know musk Bill Gates what who are the shapers do you
00:08:49 find yourself thinking about when you're constructing these ideas the ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you
00:08:56 well as I say a shaper for me is somebody who comes up with a great visualization usually a really unique
00:09:06 visualization and then actually builds it out and makes the world different changes the world in that kind of a way
00:09:13 so when I look at it Marc Benioff with Salesforce Chris Anderson with Ted Mohamed Younis with social enterprise in
00:09:21 philanthropy Canada and Harlem Children's Zone there are all domains have shapers who have the ability to
00:09:31 visualize and make extraordinary things happen what are the commonalities in some of them the commonalities
00:09:40 our first of all the excitement of something new that call to adventure and and again that practicality the capacity
00:09:49 to learn it and the capacity then they're they're able to be in many ways full rage that means they're able to go
00:09:58 from the big big picture down to the detail so let's say for example Elon Musk he describes he gets a lot of money
00:10:08 from selling PayPal his interest in PayPal he said why isn't anybody going to Mars or out of space what we're gonna
00:10:16 do if the planet goes to hell and how do i how do we going to get that and nobody's paying attention to that he
00:10:22 doesn't know much about it he then reads and learns and so on says I'm gonna take ok half of my money and I'm gonna put it
00:10:30 in there and I'm gonna do this thing and he learns a blood level about and he's got creative okay that's one dimension
00:10:39 and so he and gave me the keys to his car was one just early days into and Tesla and he then points out the details
00:10:48 okay if you push this button here it's this the detail death so he's simultaneously talking about the
00:10:56 big the big big big picture okay windows humanity going to abandon the panic but he will then be able to take it down
00:11:05 into the detail so he can go let's call it helicoptering he can go up he can go down and see things at those types of
00:11:10 perspective and they're using it with the other shapers and that's a common thing that they can do that another
00:11:17 important difference that they have in mind is how they deal with people i mean meaning there's nothing more important
00:11:27 than achieving the mission and so what they have in common is that there's a test that I give these personality tests
00:11:35 because they're very helpful for understanding people and so I gave it to all these shapers and one of the things
00:11:43 in workplace inventory test is this test and it has a category called concern for others whatever it's a they were all
00:11:50 having concern for others this includes Mohan Yunis who invented microfinance social enterprise impact investing is Muhammad
00:11:58 Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize for this Congressional Medal of Honor one of the Fortune determined one of the 10
00:12:09 greatest entrepreneurs of our time he's built all sorts of businesses to give back money and social enterprise a
00:12:16 remarkable man he has nobody that I know practically could have more concern for others I'm he lives a life of a saint I
00:12:25 mean very modest lifestyle and he puts all his money into trying to help others and he tests low on the courts called
00:12:30 concern for others because what it really those the questions under that are questions about conflict to get at
00:12:38 the mission so they all Geoffrey Canada change Harlem Children's Zone and developed that to take children in
00:12:44 Harlem and get them well taken care of not only just in their education but their whole lives harmless in also
00:12:50 concern for others what they mean is that they can see whether though individuals are performing at a level
00:13:00 that an extremely high level that's necessary to make those dreams happen so when you think of let's say Steve Jobs
00:13:08 was famous for being you know difficult with people and so on and I don't know Steve Jobs so I can't speak personally
00:13:15 to that but he's comments on Dae players and if you have 80 players if you put in B players pretty soon you'll have C
00:13:20 players and so on that is a common element of them holding people to high standards and not letting anybody stand
00:13:28 in the way of the the mission what do you think about that kind of idea is sorry to pause on that for a second that
00:13:37 the a B and C players and the importance of so when you have a mission to really only have a players and be sort of
00:13:45 aggressively filtering for that yes but I think that there are all different ways of being a players and I think in
00:13:53 what a great a great team you have to appreciate all the differences in ways of being a players ok yes that's the
00:14:01 first thing and then you always have to be super excellent to my opinion you always have to be
00:14:08 really excellent people with people to help them understand each other themselves and get in sync with them
00:14:16 about what's true about them and their circumstances now they're doing so that they're having a fabulous personal
00:14:22 development experience at the same time as you're dealing with them so when I say that they're all different ways this
00:14:31 is one of the than qualities you asked me the one of the qualities so one of the third qualities that I would say is
00:14:40 to know how to deal well with your not knowing and to be able to get the best expertise so that you're a great
00:14:50 Orchestrator of different ways so that the people who are really really successful unlike most people believe
00:14:57 that they're successful because of what they know they're at even more successful by being able to effectively
00:15:05 learn from others and tapping into the skills of people who see things different from them brilliant so how do
00:15:11 you when they're that personality being first of all open to the fact that there's other people see things
00:15:18 differently than you and at the same time have supreme confidence in your vision is there just a psychology of
00:15:26 that do you see attention there between the confidence and the open-mindedness and now it's funny because I think we
00:15:32 grow up thinking that there's a tension there right that there's a confidence and and the more confidence that you
00:15:39 have there's attention with the open-mindedness and not being sure okay confident and accurate are almost
00:15:49 negatively correlated many people they're extremely confident and they're often inaccurate and so I think one of
00:15:57 the greatest tragedies of people is not realizing how those things two go together because instead it's really
00:16:06 that by saying I know a lot and how do I know I'm still not wrong and how do I take that the best thinking of all
00:16:14 available to me and then raise my probability of learning all these people think for them
00:16:20 selves okay I mean meaning they're smart but they take in like vacuum cleaners they take in ideas of others they stress
00:16:29 test their ideas with others they assess what comes back to them in the form of other thinking and they also know what
00:16:36 they're not good at and what other people who are good at the things that they're not good at they know how to get
00:16:42 those people and be successful all around because nobody has enough knowledge in their heads and that I
00:16:49 think is one of the great differences Sutton the reason my company has been successful in terms of this is because
00:16:56 of an idea meritocratic decision-making a process by which you can get the best ideas you know what's an idea
00:17:04 meritocracy an idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas that are available out there and to work together with
00:17:10 other people and the team to achieve that it's an incredible process that you describe in several places to arrive at
00:17:17 the truth but apologize from romanticizing the notion blaming linger on it just having enough self belief you
00:17:26 don't think there's a self delusion there that's necessary especially in the beginning you talk about in the journey
00:17:34 maybe the trials or the abyss do you think there is value to deluding yourself I think what you're calling
00:17:46 delusion is a bad word yes for uncertainty okay so I mean in other words because we keep going back to the
00:17:54 question how would you know and all of these things know I think that delusion is not going to help you that you have
00:18:01 to find out truth okay to deal with uncertainty not saying aunt listen I have this dream and I don't know how I'm
00:18:08 going to get that dream I mentioned in my book principles and describe the process in a more complete way than
00:18:15 we're gonna be able to go here but what happens is I say you form your dreams first and you can't judge whether you're
00:18:24 going to achieve those dreams because you haven't learned the things that you're going to learn on the way toward
00:18:31 those dreams okay so if that isn't delusion I wouldn't use delusion I think you're over emphasizing
00:18:39 the importance of knowing whether you're going to succeed or not get rid of that okay if you can get rid of that and say
00:18:49 okay no I can have that dream but I'm so realistic in the notion of finding out I'm curious I'm a great learner I'm a
00:18:57 great experimenter along the way you'll do those experiments which will teach you more truths and more learning about
00:19:04 the reality so that you can get your dreams because if you still live in that world of delusion okay and you think
00:19:11 your lusion is helpful no the delusion isn't don't confuse delusion with not knowing yes
00:19:18 but nevertheless so if we look at the abyss we can look at your own that you describe it's difficult psychologically
00:19:26 for people so in many people quit many people choose a path that is more comfortable and I mean that the the
00:19:34 heartbreak of that you know breaks people so if you have the dream and then there's this cycle of learning setting a
00:19:41 goal and so on what's your value for the psychology of just being broken by these difficult moments well that's that
00:19:48 that's classically the defining moment it's almost like evolution taking care of okay now you're you crash you're in
00:19:57 the abyss oh my god that's bad and then the question is what do you do and it sorts people okay and that's what that's
00:20:04 some people get off the field and they say oh I don't like this and so on and some people learn and they have decay
00:20:13 and they have a metamorphosis and it changes their approach to learning it the number one thing it should give them
00:20:20 is uncertainty you should take an audacious dreaming guy who wants to change the world crash okay and then
00:20:31 come out of that crashing and saying okay I can be audacious and scared that I'm going to be wrong at the same time
00:20:41 and then how do I do that because that's the key when you don't lose your audaciousness and you
00:20:47 going after your big goal and at the same time you say hey I'm worried that I'm gonna be wrong you gain your radical
00:20:54 open-mindedness that allows you to take in the things that allows you to go to the next level of being successful so
00:21:01 your own process I mean you've talked about it before but it'll be great if you can describe it because our darkest
00:21:07 moments are perhaps the most interesting so your own and what the prediction of the another Depression economic
00:21:15 depression highest apologize economic depression can you talk to what you were feeling thinking planning and
00:21:25 strategizing in those moments yeah that was that was my biggest moment okay building my little company this is in
00:21:36 1981-82 I had calculated that American banks had given a lot more money to lent a lot more money to Latin American
00:21:42 countries than those countries were going to pay back and that they would have a debt crisis and that this had
00:21:50 said the economy tumbling and that was an extremely controversial point of view then it started to happen and it
00:21:57 happened in Mexico default that in August 1982 I thought that there was going to be a an economic collapse that
00:22:04 was going to follow because there was a series of the other countries it was just playing out it as I had imagined
00:22:10 and that well it couldn't have been more wrong that was the exact bottom in the stock market because central bank sees
00:22:17 monetary policy blah blah blah and I couldn't have been more wrong and I was very publicly wrong and all of that and
00:22:23 I lost money for me and I lost money for my clients and I was I only had a small company then but I had these were close
00:22:32 people I had to let them go I was down to me as the last person that I I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad
00:22:42 to help to pay for my family bills very painful and at the same time I would say it definitely was one of the best things
00:22:50 that ever happened to me maybe the best thing for him happened to me because it changed my approach to decision making
00:22:57 it's what I'm saying in other words I kept saying okay how do I know whether I'm right how do I
00:23:03 know what I'm not wrong it gave me that and now and it didn't give up by audaciousness because I was in a
00:23:10 position what am I going to do am I gonna go down back put on a tie go to Wall Street and D and just do those
00:23:18 things no I can't bring myself to do that so I'm in a juncture how do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with that
00:23:24 and it tells me how to deal with my uncertainties and that taught me for example a number of techniques first to
00:23:31 find the smartest people I could find who disagreed with me and to have quality disagreement I learned the art
00:23:38 of thoughtful disagreement I learned how to produce diversification I learned how to do a number of things that's is what
00:23:46 led me to create an idea meritocracy in other words person by person I hired them and I wanted the smartest people
00:23:51 who would be independent thinkers who would disagree with each other and me well so that we could be independent
00:23:58 thinkers to go off to produce those audacious dreams because you have to be an independent thinker to do that and to
00:24:04 do that not independently of the consensus independently of each other and then work ourselves through that
00:24:10 because who know whether you're gonna have the right answer and by doing that then that was the key to our success
00:24:17 and the things that I want to pass along to people the reason I'm doing this podcast with you is you know I'm 70
00:24:26 years old and that is a magical way of a achieving success if you can create an idea meritocracy it's it's so much
00:24:34 better in terms of achieving success and also quality relationships with people but that's what that experience gave me
00:24:40 so if we can look around a little bit longer the idea of an idea meritocracy it's fascinating but especially because it
00:24:48 seems to be rare not just in companies but in society so there's a lot of people on Twitter and public discourse
00:24:56 and politics and so on that are really stuck in certain sets of ideas whatever they are so when you're confronted with
00:25:04 it with an idea that said that's different than your own about a particular topic what kind of process do
00:25:12 you go through mental are you arguing through the idea with the person sort of present is almost
00:25:19 like a debate or do you sit on it and consider the world sort of empathetically if this is true then what
00:25:27 is that war look like does that world make sense and so on so what's the process of considering those conflicting
00:25:35 ideas I'm gonna answer that question but after saying first imposed implicit in your question is it's not common okay
00:25:44 what's common produces only common results okay so don't judge yes anything that is good based on whether it's
00:25:52 common because you're on its only going to give you common results if you want unique you have a unique approach yes
00:25:58 okay and so that art of thoughtful disagreement is the is the capacity to hold two things in your mind at the same
00:26:09 time the G I think this makes sense and then saying I'm not sure it makes sense and then try to say why does it make
00:26:19 sense and then to triangulate with others so if I'm having a discussion like that and I work myself through and
00:26:28 I'm not sure then I have to do that in a good way so I always give attention for example what let's start off what does
00:26:35 the other person know relative to what I know so if a person has a higher expertise or things I'm much more
00:26:42 inclined to ask questions I'm always asking questions if you want to learn you're asking questions you're not
00:26:49 arguing okay you're taking in your assessing when it comes in to you does that make sense so you're learning
00:26:55 something are you getting epiphanies and so on and I try to then do that if the conversation it as we're trying to
00:27:03 decide what is true and we're trying to do that together and we see truth different then I might even call in
00:27:11 another really smart capable person and try to say what is true and how do we explore that together and you go through
00:27:19 that same thing so I would I said I describe it as having open mindedness and assertiveness at the same time that
00:27:27 you can simultaneous be open-minded and taken with that curiosity and then also be assertive and
00:27:34 say but that doesn't make sense why would this be the case and you do that back and forth and when you're doing
00:27:42 that kind of back and forth on the topic like the economy which you have to me or have some naive but it seems both
00:27:51 incredible and incredibly complex the economy the trading the transactions that these transactions between two
00:27:59 individuals somehow add up to this giant mechanism you've put out a thirty minute video you have a lot of incredible
00:28:07 videos online that people should definitely watch on YouTube but you've put out this thirty minute video titled
00:28:14 how the economic machine works that is probably one of the best if not the best video I've seen that the internet in
00:28:22 terms of educational videos so people should definitely watch it especially because it's not that the individual
00:28:30 components of the video are somehow revolutionary but the simplicity and the clarity of the different components just
00:28:37 makes you there's a few light bulb moments there about what how the economy works as a machine so as you described
00:28:43 there's three main forces that drive the economy productivity growth short term debt cycle long-term debt cycle the the
00:28:50 former productivity growth is how valuable things how much value people create valuable things people create the
00:29:00 latter is people borrowing from the their future selves to hopefully create those valuable things faster so this is
00:29:07 an incredible system to me maybe we can linger on in a little bit but you've also said well most people
00:29:15 think about as money is actually credit total amount of credit in the u.s. is 50 trillion dollars total amount of money
00:29:24 is three trillion dollars that's just crazy to me maybe maybe I'm silly maybe you can
00:29:30 educate me but that seems crazy it gives me just pause that the human civilization has been able to create a
00:29:38 system that has so much credit so that's a long way to ask do you think credit is good or bad for
00:29:47 society that system of that's so fundamentally based on credit I think credit is great even though people often
00:29:56 overdo it the credit is that somebody has earned money yeah and you know and what happens is they lend it to somebody
00:30:06 else who's got better ideas and they cut a deal and then that person with the better ideas is gonna pay it back and if
00:30:13 it works well it helps resource allocations go well providing people luck like the entrepreneurs and all of
00:30:20 those they need capital they don't have capital themselves and so somebody's gonna give them capital
00:30:25 and they'll give them credit and along those lines then what happens is it's not managed well in a variety of ways so
00:30:34 I did a another book on principles principles of big debt crisis that go into that and it's free by the way I met
00:30:44 put it free online on as a PDF so if you go online and you look principles for big debt crisis is under my name you can
00:30:51 download it in a PDF or you can buy a print book of it and it goes through that particular process and so you
00:31:00 always have it over done in always the same way everything by the way almost everything happens over and over again
00:31:07 for the same reasons okay so these debt crisis has all happen over and over again for the same reasons they get it
00:31:13 over done in the book it explains how you identify whether it's overdone or not they get it overdone and then you go
00:31:19 through the process of making the adjustments according that and then and it explains how they can use the levers
00:31:27 and so on if you didn't have credit then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck so credit is a good thing but
00:31:37 it can easily be overdone so now we get into the quote what is money what is credit okay you get into money and
00:31:44 credit so if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile keep in mind that the central bank let's say it can
00:31:51 print the money what is that problem they you have an IOU the IOU says you're going to get a
00:31:58 certain number of dollars let's say or yet nor euros and that is what the IOU is and so the question is will you get
00:32:07 that money and and what will it be worth and then also you have a government which is a participant in that process
00:32:14 because they want they are on the hook they old money and then will they print the money to make it easy for everybody
00:32:22 to pay so you have to pay attention to those two I would suggest like you you recommend to other people just take that
00:32:30 30 minutes and it in it and it comes across pretty clearly but my conclusion is that of course you want it and even
00:32:39 if you understand it and the cycles well you can benefit from those cycles rather than to be hurt by those cycles because
00:32:48 I don't know the way the cycle works if somebody gets over indebted they have to sell an asset okay then I don't know me
00:32:55 that's when assets become cheaper how do you acquire the asset it's a whole process so again maybe another another
00:33:04 dumb question but there are no such things as dumb questions okay there you go but what is money so you've mentioned
00:33:13 you know credit and money it's another thing that if I just zoom out from an alien perspective and look at human
00:33:20 civilization it's incredible that we've created a thing that's not that only works because currency because we all
00:33:33 agree it has value so I guess my question is how do you think about money as this emergent phenomenon and what do
00:33:41 you think is the future of money you've come into that Bitcoin other forms what do you think is its history and future
00:33:51 how do you think about money there are two things that money is for it's a medium of exchange and it's a store hold
00:34:01 of wealth yes that's that that some money you know the so you could say something's a medium of exchange
00:34:08 and then you could say is it a store hold of wealth okay so those and money is that vehicle that is those things and
00:34:21 can be used to pay off your debt so when you have a debt and you provide it it pays off your debt so that that's that
00:34:30 process and it's a I apologize to interrupt but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth when everybody
00:34:38 recognizes it to be a value that's right right and so you see in the history and you around the world and you go to
00:34:46 places I was in an island and the Pacific in which they had as money these big stones and literally they were
00:34:58 taking a boat this this big carved stone and they were taking it from one of the islands to the other and it sank the the
00:35:07 the piece of this big stone piece of money that they had and it went to the bottom and they still perceived it as
00:35:15 having value so that it was even though it's in the bottom and it's this big hunk of rock the fact that somebody
00:35:20 owned it they would say oh I'll loan it for this and that I've seen beads in different places shells converted to
00:35:29 this and mediums of exchange and when we look at what we've got you're exactly right it is the notion that if I give it
00:35:35 to you I can then take it and I can buy something with it and that's so it's a
00:35:42 matter of perception okay and then we go through then the history of money and the vulnerabilities of money and what we
00:35:51 have is there's through history there's been two types of money those that are claims on something of value like the
00:36:02 connection of to gold or something that that would be an or they just are money without any connection which and then we
00:36:09 have a system now which is a Fiat monetary system so that's what money is then it will last as long as its captive
00:36:18 value and it works the way so let's say central banks when they get in the position of like they owe a
00:36:27 lot of money like we have the in the case it's increasingly the case and they also another a bind and they have the
00:36:34 printing press to print the money and get out of that and you have a lot of people might be in that position then
00:36:41 you can print it and then it could be devalued in there and so history is show and forget about today history has shown
00:36:52 that no currency has laughs every currency has either ended as being a currency been or devalued as the
00:37:00 currency over periods of time long periods of time so it evolved and it changes but everybody needs that medium
00:37:07 of exchange and everybody needs that store hold of wealth so it keeps changing what is money over a period of
00:37:15 time but so much is being digitized today and there's this ideas that based on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on
00:37:25 so if all currencies like all empires come to an end what do you think well do you think something like Bitcoin might
00:37:34 emerge as as a common store value store of wealth and a medium of exchange the problem with Bitcoin is that it's
00:37:45 not a fact the medium exchange like it's not easy for me to go in there and buy things with it and then it's not an
00:37:52 effective store hold of value because it has a volatility that's based on speculation and the like so yeah it's
00:38:00 not a very effective saving that's very different from Facebook's prop of a stable value currency which would be
00:38:08 effective as both a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth because if you were to hold it and in the way it's
00:38:15 linked to number of things that it's linked to would mean that it could be a very effective store hold of wealth then
00:38:22 you have a digital currency that could be a very effective medium exchange and store hold of wealth that so in my
00:38:30 opinion some digital currencies are likely to succeed more or based on that ability to do it then the
00:38:38 question is what happens okay what happens is two central banks allow that to happen
00:38:45 I really do believe it's possible to get a better form of money that central banks don't control okay a better force
00:38:53 of money that the central banks don't control but then that's not yet happened and we also have to and so they've got
00:39:02 to go through that evolutionary process in order to go through that evolutionary process first of all governments have
00:39:09 got to allow that to happen which is to some extent a threat to them in terms of their power and and that's
00:39:16 an issue and and then you have to also build the confidence and all of the components of it to say okay that's
00:39:24 going to be effective because I won't get in I won't have problems owning it so I think that digital currencies have
00:39:35 a have some element of potential but there's a lot of hurdles that are going to have to be gotten over I think that
00:39:43 it'll be a very long time possibly never but anyway a very long time before we have that let's say get into a position
00:39:52 that would be you know effective means relative to gold let's say if you were think of that because gold has a track
00:40:00 record you know of thousands of years okay Unum all across countries and it has its mobility it has the ability to
00:40:07 put it down and has certain abilities it's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies but but central banks
00:40:15 will hold it like their central banks that worry about others you know the other country central banks might worry
00:40:21 about whether the US dollar is going to print or not in that and so the thing they're going to go to is not going to
00:40:27 be the digital currency thing they're going to go to is is gold or something else some other currency they got a
00:40:34 ticket and so I think it's a long way to go well you think it's possible then one day we don't even have a central bank
00:40:40 because of the a currency that doesn't that's cannot be controlled by the central bank is the
00:40:52 primary currency or is that some very it would be very remote possibility or very long in the future got it again may be a
00:41:04 dumb question but romanticize one when you sit back and you look you describe these transactions between individuals
00:41:13 somehow creating short term debt cycles long-term debt cycles this productivity growth does it amaze you that this whole
00:41:24 thing works that that there's however many millions and millions of people in the United States globally over seven
00:41:31 billion people that this thing between individual transactions it just it works yeah it amazes me like I go I go back
00:41:43 and forth between being in it and then I think like how does a credit card that is that really possible
00:41:51 I'm still used to I look up credit card and I put it on the guy doesn't know me yeah it'll streamlines okay we're making
00:41:59 the digital entries is that really secure enough and that that kind of thing and then it goes back and it goes
00:42:05 this and it clears and it all happens and it what I marvel at that and those types of things is because of the the
00:42:14 capacity of the human mind to create abstractions that are true you know it's imagination and then the ability to go
00:42:24 from one level and then if these things are true then you go to the next level and if those things are true then you go
00:42:31 to the next level and all those miracles that we almost become common it's like it when I'm flying in a plane or what
00:42:38 I'm looking at all of the things that happen when I get communications in the middle of I don't know Africa or
00:42:46 Antarctica and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face on my iPad of somebody my grandkid in someplace
00:42:53 else and I look at and I say wow yes it all amazes me so while being amazing do you have a
00:43:03 sense the principles you describe that the whole thing is stable somehow also or is this I was just lucky so the the
00:43:11 principles that you describe are those describing a system that is stable robust and will remain so or is it a
00:43:23 lucky accident of our early history my area of expertise is economics and market so I get down to it like a real
00:43:29 nitty-gritty yes I can tell you whether the plane is going to fall out of the sky yes because of its particular
00:43:35 fundamentals I don't know enough about that but it happens over and over again and so on it gives me faith ok so
00:43:42 without me knowing it in the markets and the economy I know those things quote well enough in a sense to say that by
00:43:53 and large that structure is right what we're seeing is right now whether there are disruptions and it has effects that
00:44:02 can come not because that structure is right I believe that's right but whether it can be hurt by let's say
00:44:11 connectivity or journal entries they could take from all the money away from you through your digital entries there's
00:44:17 all sorts of things that can happen in various ways that means that that money is worthless or the system Falls but
00:44:25 from what I see in terms of its basic structure and those complexities that still take my breath away I would say
00:44:33 knowing them enough about the mechanics of them that doesn't worry me have you seen disruptions in your
00:44:38 lifetime that really surprised you most all the time this is one of the great lessons of my life is that there many
00:44:48 times I've seen things that I was very surprised about and that I realized almost all of those I was surprised
00:44:58 about because they just they were just the first time it happened to me they didn't happen in my lifetime before but
00:45:05 when I researched them they happened in other places or other people lifetimes so for example I remember 1971
00:45:14 the dollar there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency didn't experience it and with the dollar was
00:45:21 connected to gold and I was watching events happen and then you get on and and he's that definition of money all of
00:45:29 a sudden went out the window because it was not tied to gold and then you have this devaluation and
00:45:37 so and then or the first oil shock or the second oil shot or so many of these things and when I but almost always I
00:45:47 realized that they when I looked in history they happened before they just happened in other people's lifetimes
00:45:56 which led me to realize that I needed to study history and what happened in other people's lifetimes and what happened in
00:46:04 other countries and places so that I would have timeless and universal principles for dealing with that thing
00:46:12 so I oh yeah I've been some you know the implausible happening but it's like a one in a hundred year storm right okay
00:46:22 or it's or they've happened before yeah nothing just not to you let me talk about if we could about AI a little bit
00:46:32 so if Bridgewater associates manage about a hundred sixty billion dollars in assets and our artificial intelligence
00:46:42 systems algorithms are pretty good with data what role in the future DC AI play in analysis and decision making in this
00:46:55 kind of data rich an impactful area of investment I'm gonna answer that not only an investment but I give them more
00:47:07 all encompassing rule for AI as I think you know for the last 25 years we have taken our thinking and put them in
00:47:17 algorithms and so we make decisions that the computer takes those criteria algorithms and they put them
00:47:24 and they're in there and it takes data and they operate as an independent decision-maker power in parallel with
00:47:32 our decision-making so for me it's like there's a chess game playing and on person with my chess game and I'm saying
00:47:40 it made that move and I'm making the move and how do I compare those two moves so so we've done a lot but let me
00:47:47 give you an if the future can be different from the past and you don't have deep understanding you should not
00:48:03 rely on AI okay those two things deep understanding of the cause-effect relationships that are leading you to
00:48:11 place that bet in anything okay anything important let's say if it was do surgeries and you would say how do I do
00:48:18 surgeries I think it's totally fine to watch all the doctors do the surgeries you can put it on I take a a digital
00:48:29 camera and do that convert that into AI algorithms that go to robots and have them do surgeries and I'd be comfortable
00:48:38 with that because if it'll do that if the keeps doing the same thing over and over again and you have enough of that
00:48:44 that would be fine even though you may not understand the algorithms because you're if the things happening over and
00:48:50 over again and you're not asking the future would be the same that appendicitis or whatever it is will be
00:48:56 handled the same way the surgery that's fine however what happens with AI is for the most part is it takes a lot of data
00:49:08 and it with a high enough sample size and then it puts together its own algorithms okay there are two ways you
00:49:16 can come up with algorithms you can either take your thinking and express them in algorithms or you can say let
00:49:24 put the data in and say what is the algorithm when you that's machine learning yeah and when you have machine
00:49:32 learning it'll give you equations which quite often are not understandable you would try to say okay
00:49:38 now describe what it's telling you it's very difficult to describe and so they can escape understanding and so it's
00:49:46 very good for doing those things that could be done over and over again if you're watching and you're not taking
00:49:51 that but if the future is different from the past and you have that then you're at the future is different from the past
00:49:58 and you don't have deep understanding you're going to get in trouble and so that's the main thing as far as
00:50:07 AI is concerned ai and I'd say computer replications of thinking in very ways I think it's particularly good for
00:50:15 processing but but the the notion of what you want to do is better most of the time determined by the human mind
00:50:25 that what are the principles like okay how should I raise my children it's gonna be a long time before AI you're
00:50:32 going to say it has a good enough judgment to do that who should I marry on all of those things maybe you can get
00:50:38 the computer to help you but if you just took data and do machine learning it's not going to find it if you were to then
00:50:46 take one of my criteria for any of those questions and then say put them into an algorithm and you'd be a lot better off
00:50:53 than if you took AI to do it but by and large the mind should be do used for inventing and those creative things and
00:51:02 then the computer should be used for processing because it could process a lot more information a lot faster a lot
00:51:10 more accurately and a lot less emotionally so any notion of thinking in the form of processing type thinking
00:51:19 should be done by a computer and anything that is in the notion of doing that other type of thinking should be
00:51:26 operating with with the brain in operating in a way where you know you can say ah that makes sense you know the
00:51:35 process of reducing your understanding down to principles is kind of like the process the the first one you mentioned
00:51:43 a type of AI algorithm where you're encoding your expertise you're trying to program right
00:51:49 the humanists trying to write a program how do you think that's attainable the process of reducing principles to a
00:52:02 computer program or when you when you say when you write about when you think of all principles is there still a human
00:52:10 element that's not reducible to an algorithm my experience has been that almost all things including those things
00:52:20 that I thought were pretty much impossible to express I've been able to express in algorithms but that doesn't
00:52:32 constitute all things so you can come you can who you can express far more than you can imagine you'll be able to
00:52:41 express so I use the example of okay it's not how do you raise your children okay you will be able to take it one
00:52:50 piece by piece okay how well at what age what school and the way to do that that means my experience is to take that and
00:52:59 when you're in the moment of making a decision or just past making a decision to take the time and to write
00:53:09 down your criteria for making that decision in words okay that that way you'll get your prize your principles
00:53:18 down on paper I created an app online call it's right now just on the iPhone it'll be in and try getting an Android
00:53:27 it'll be an Android it'll be in a few months it'll be on an awesome but it has an app in there that helps people write
00:53:35 down their own principles because this is very powerful so when you're in that moment where you've just you're thinking
00:53:42 about it and you're thinking your criteria for you know choosing the school for your child or whatever that
00:53:48 might be and you write down your criteria or whatever they are those principles you write down and you you
00:53:57 that will at that moment make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way and if you have the way that we
00:54:06 operate that you have easy access so then the next time that comes along you can go to that or you can show those
00:54:12 principles to others to see if they're the right principles you will get a clarity of that principle that's really
00:54:19 invaluable in words and that'll help you a lot then but then you start to think how do i express that in data and it'll
00:54:29 shock you about how you can do that you'll you'll form an equation that will show the relationship between these
00:54:35 particular parts and then the essentially the variables that are going to go into that particular equation and
00:54:43 you will be able to do that and you take that little piece and you put it into the computer and then take the next
00:54:50 little piece and you put that into the computer and before you know it you will have a decision making system that's of
00:54:58 the sort that I'm describing so that you're almost making an argument against the past an earlier statement you've
00:55:04 made and you're convinced to me at first you said there's no way a computer could raise a child essentially but now you've
00:55:12 described in making me think of it if you have that kind of idea meritocracy you have this rigorous approach at
00:55:19 Bridgewater takes an investment and apply it to raising a child it feels like through the process each is
00:55:27 described we could as a society arrive at a set of principles for raising a child and encoded into a computer that
00:55:38 originality will not come from machine learning the first time you do so that the original yes that's what I'm
00:55:44 referring to but eventually as we together develop it and then we can automate it that's why I'm saying the
00:55:50 processing yes can be done by the computer so we're saying the same thing we're not inconsistent and we're saying
00:55:57 the same thing that the processing of that information in those algorithms can be done by the computer in a very very
00:56:04 effective way you don't need to sit there and process and try to weigh all those things in your equation and all
00:56:11 those things but that notion of okay how do I get at that principle and you're saying you
00:56:18 surprised yes you how much you can express that's right you can do that so this is where I think you're going to
00:56:29 see the future and right now we you know go to our devices and we get information to a large extent and then we get some
00:56:39 guidance we have our GPS and the like in my opinion principles principles principles principles I want to
00:56:45 emphasize that you write them down you've got those principles they will be converted into algorithms for
00:56:53 decision-making and they're going to also have the benefit of collective decision-making because right now
00:57:01 individuals based on what stuck in their heads are making their decisions in very ignorant ways they're not the best
00:57:07 decision makers they're not the best criteria and they're operating when those principles are written down and
00:57:15 converted into algorithms it's almost like you'll look at that and follow the instructions and it'll give you better
00:57:22 results medic medicine will be much more like this you can go to your local doctor and you could ask his point of
00:57:29 view and whatever and he's rushed and he may not be the best doctor around and you're gonna go to this thing and get
00:57:35 that same information or just automatically have it input in that and it's gonna tell you okay here's what you
00:57:42 should go do and it's going to be much better than your local doctor and that that the converting of information into
00:57:50 intelligence okay intelligence is the thing we're coming out with again I'm 70 and I want to pass
00:57:59 all these things along so all these tools that I've found need to develop all over these periods of time all those
00:58:07 things I want to make an available and what's going to happen as you there they're going to see this they're going
00:58:14 to see these tools operating much more that way the idea of converting data into intelligence intelligence for
00:58:23 example on what they are like right or what are your strengths and weaknesses intelligence on who
00:58:28 why work well with under what circumstance analyzed intelligence we're gonna go from what are called systems of
00:58:36 record which are a lot of okay information organized in the right way to intelligence and we're going to that
00:58:46 Trent that'll be the next big move in my opinion and so you will get intelligence back and that that intelligence comes
00:58:53 from reducing things down to principles into that's how what happens so what's your intuition if you look at the future
00:59:00 societies do you think we'll be able to the details of our lives down to principles that would be further and
00:59:10 further automated I think the real question hinges on people's emotional emotions and irrational behaviors I
00:59:23 think that there's subliminal things that we want okay and then there's cerebral the you know conscious logic oh
00:59:33 and the too often are at odds so there's almost like to use and you write and so let's say what do you want and your mind
00:59:43 will answer one thing your emotions or lands or something else so when I think about it I think emotions are I want
00:59:51 inspiration I want love is a good thing being able to have a good impact but it is in the reconciliation of your
01:00:01 subliminal wants and your intellectual wants so that you really say they're aligned and so to do that in a way to
01:00:11 get what you want so irrationality is a bad thing if it means that it doesn't make sense in getting you what you want
01:00:19 but you better decide what you your satisfying is it the lower level you emotional subliminal one or is it the
01:00:26 other but if you can align them so what I find is that by going from my you experience the decision do this thing
01:00:35 subliminally and that's the thing I want it comes to the surface I find that if I can align that with what my logical me
01:00:44 wants and does do the devil double-check between them and I get the same sort of thing that that helps me a lot I find
01:00:52 for example meditation is one of the things that helps to achieve that alignment it's fantastic for achieving
01:00:59 that alignment and often then I also want to not just do it in my head I want to say does that make sense help you you
01:01:06 and so I do with other people and I say okay well let's say I want this thing and whatever it does that make sense and
01:01:13 when you do that kind of triangulation you're to use and you do that with also the other way
01:01:20 then you certainly want to be rational right but rationality has to be defined by those things and then you discover sort
01:01:30 of new ideas that the drive you're just so-so is you're always at the edge of the set of principles you've developed
01:01:36 you're doing new things always well that's where the intellect is needed well and the inspiration the inspiration
01:01:44 is needed to do that right like what are you doing it for the segment what is the velocity the hunger what's  if you can
01:01:53 be Freud for a second what's in that subconscious well it's the thing that drives us all I think you can't
01:02:00 generalize of us I think different people are driven by different things there's not a common one right so like
01:02:08 if you would take the shapers I think it is a combination of subliminally it's a combination of excitement curiosity is
01:02:20 there a dark element there is there is their demons there's their fears is there in your sense  most of the ones
01:02:27 the most of the ones that I'm dealing with I have not seen that I see the what I really see is who if I can do that
01:02:38 that would be the most dream and then the act of creativity and you say whew so excitement is one of the things
01:02:48 curiosity is a big pull okay and then tenacity you know okay at that to do those things but definitely emotions are
01:02:55 entering into it then there's an intellectual component of it too okay it may be empathy it may can I have an
01:03:04 impact can I have an impact the desire to have an impact that's an emotional thrill and but it also it has empathy
01:03:12 and then you start to see spirituality but a spirituality I mean the connectedness to the whole you start to
01:03:18 see people operate those things those tend to be the things that you see the most of and I think you're gonna shut
01:03:27 down this idea completely but there's a notion that some of these shapers really walk the line between sort of
01:03:34 madness and genius do you think madness has a role in any of this or do you still see Steve Jobs in a mosque is
01:03:42 fundamentally rational the others a continuum there then what comes to my mind is that genius is that often at the
01:03:56 edge in some cases imaginary genius is at the edge of insanity and it's almost like a radio that I think okay if I can
01:04:06 tune it just right it's playing right but if I go a little bit too far yeah it goes off yeah okay and so you can you
01:04:16 can see this kay Jamison was studying bipolar what it shows is that you know that's definitely the case because when
01:04:24 you're going out there that imagination whatever is that the can be near the edge sometimes it doesn't have to always
01:04:32 be so let me ask you about automation that's been a part of public discourse recently what's your view on the impact
01:04:42 of automation of whether we're talking about AI a more basic forms of automation on the economy in the short
01:04:49 term in the long term do you have concerns about it as some do or do you think it's overblown it's not overblown
01:04:57 and it's a it's a giant thing it'll come at us in a very big way and in the future we're right at the edge of even
01:05:04 really accelerating it it's had a big impact and it will have a big impact and it's a two-edged sword because it'll
01:05:15 have tremendous benefits and at the same time it has profound benefits in employment and distributions of wealth
01:05:24 because the way I think think about it is there are certain things human beings can do and over time we've evolved to go
01:05:34 to almost higher and higher levels and now we're almost like we're at this level you know it used to be your labor
01:05:41 you would then do your labor and okay we can get past the labor we got tractors and things and you go up up up up up and
01:05:48 we're up over here and to the point in our minds we're okay anything related to mental processing the computer can
01:05:58 probably do better and we can find that and so other than almost inventing you're at a point where these are the
01:06:07 Commission's and the automation will probably do it better and and that's accelerating and that's a force and
01:06:16 that's a force for the good and at the same time it what it does is it displaces people in terms of employment
01:06:23 and changes and it produces wealth gaps and all of that so I think the real issue is that that has to be viewed as a
01:06:32 national emergency in other words I think the well the wealth gap theme the income gap the opportunity gap all of
01:06:41 those things that force is creating the problems that we're having today a lot of the problems the the great polarity
01:06:50 the disenfranchised eat dis not equal not anything approaching equality of education all of these problems a lot of
01:06:59 problems are coming as a result of that and so there it needs to be viewed really as an emergency situation in
01:07:09 which there's a good work good plan worked out for how to deal with that effectively so that it's dealt with
01:07:20 effectively so because it's it's it you know it's good for the average it's good for the impact but it's not good for
01:07:26 everyone in the crates that polarity so it's got to be dealt with yeah and you've talked about the American Dream
01:07:31 and that that's something that all people should have an opportunity for and then we need to reform capitalism to
01:07:39 give that opportunity for everyone let me ask kind of one of the ideas in terms of safety nets that support that kind of
01:07:48 opportunity there's been a lot of discussion of universal basic income amongst people so there's
01:07:55 andrew yang who's running on that he's a political candidate running for president on the idea of the universal
01:08:01 basic income what do you think about that giving a thousand dollars or some amount of money to everybody as a way to
01:08:10 give them the the padding the freedom to sort of take leaps to take the call for adventure to take the crazy procedure
01:08:19 before I get right into the my thoughts on universal basic income I want to start with the notion that opportunity
01:08:31 education development creating equality so that you people say there's equal opportunity and is the most important
01:08:42 thing and then to find out what is the amount how are you going to provide that what where what how does it how do you
01:08:49 get the money into a public school system how do you get the teaching how do you what do the fleshing out that
01:08:58 plan to create equal opportunity in all of its various forms is the most pressing thing to do and so I'm you know
01:09:07 that is that the the opportunity is the most important one you're kind of implying is the earlier the better sort
01:09:14 of like opportunity to education so in the early development of a human being is when you should have the equal
01:09:21 opportunities that's the most important right in the first phase of your life which goes from birth until you're on
01:09:29 your own and you're an adult and you're now out there and you deal with early childhood development okay and you take
01:09:37 the brain and you say what's important the child care okay like the it makes a world of difference for example if you
01:09:45 have good parents who are trying to think about instilling the stability in a non traumatic environment to provide
01:09:53 them so I would say the good guidance that normally comes from parents and the good education that they're receiving
01:10:04 are you know the most important things in that person's development the ability to be able to be prepared to go
01:10:12 out there and then to go into a market that's an equal opportunity job market to be able to then go into that kind of
01:10:21 market is a system that creates not only fairness anything else is not fair and then in addition to that it also is a
01:10:30 more effective economic system because the consequences of not doing that are to a society or devastating if you look
01:10:38 at what the difference in outcomes for somebody who completes high school or doesn't complete high school or does
01:10:46 each one of those state changes and you look at what that means in terms of their costs to society not only
01:10:52 themselves but their cost and incarceration costs and then on crimes and all of those things it's
01:11:00 economically better for the society and it's fairer if they can complete fake an get those particular things once they
01:11:08 have those things then you move on to other things but yes from birth all the way through that process anything less
01:11:18 than that is bad is a tragedy and and so on so that's what  that's yeah those are the things that I'm estimate and so
01:11:25 my I'm what I would want to above all else is to provide that so with that in mind now we'll talk about universal
01:11:31 basic income start with that well now we can talk about well the bright because you have to have that now the question
01:11:37 is what's the best way to provide that okay so when I look at UB I I really think is what is going to happen with
01:11:47 that thousand dollars okay and will that thousand dollars come from another program does that come from an early
01:11:54 childhood developmental program who are you giving the thousand dollars to and what will they do for that thousand
01:12:01 dollars I mean like my reaction would be I think it's a great thing that everybody should have almost a thousand
01:12:08 dollars in their bank and so on but when do they get to make decisions or who's the parent a lot of pit times you can
01:12:14 give a thousand dollars to somebody and it could have a negative result it can have you know they can use that money
01:12:20 detrimental II not just for octave Lee and if that money's coming away from some of those other things
01:12:25 that are going to produce the things I want and you're shifted to let's say to come in and give a check doesn't mean it's
01:12:32 outcomes are going to be good and providing those things that I think are so fundamental important if it was just
01:12:39 everybody can have a thousand dollars and use it so when the time is not well and use it well that would be really
01:12:45 really good because it's almost like everybody you'd wish everybody could have a thousand dollars worth of wiggle
01:12:52 room in their lives okay and I think that would be great I love that but we I want to make sure that these other
01:12:59 things that are taken care of so if it comes out of that budget and you know I don't want it to come out of that budget
01:13:06 that's gonna be doing those things and I you know so you have to figure it out and you know a certain skepticism that
01:13:15 human nature will use may not always in fact frequently may not use that thousand dollars for the optimal to
01:13:22 support the optimal trajectory some will and some won't one of the big advantages of universal basic income is that if you
01:13:30 put it in the hands let's say parents who know how to do the right things and make the right choices yes for their
01:13:36 children because they're responsible and you say I'm gonna give them a thousand dollars wiggle room to use for the
01:13:42 benefit of their children wow that sounds great if you put it in the hands of let's say an alcoholic or drug
01:13:51 addicted parent who is not making those choices well for their children and what they do is they take that thousand
01:13:58 dollars and they don't use it well then that's going to produce more harm than good well put your if I may say so one
01:14:06 of the richest people in the world so you're a good person ask does money buy happiness no it's been shown that between once you
01:14:18 get over a basic level of income so that you can take care of the pain then you know you can health and whatever there's
01:14:27 no correlation between the level of happiness that one has and the level of money that one has they that would
01:14:37 has the highest correlation is quality relationships with others community if you look at surveys of these things
01:14:44 across all surveys and all societies it's a sense of community and per into personal relationships that is not in
01:14:53 any way correlated with money you can go down to native tribes and you know very poor places or you can go in all
01:15:01 different communities and so they have the opportunity to have that I'm very lucky in that I started with nothing so
01:15:08 I had the full range I can tell you I you know I not having money but but and then having quite a lot of money and I
01:15:15 you know I did that in the right order I'll tell you started from nothing in Long Island yeah and my dad was a jazz
01:15:22 musician but I but I had all really that I needed because I had two parents who loved me and took good care of me and I
01:15:29 went to a public school that was a good public school and basically you know that you don't need much more than that
01:15:35 in order to that's the equal opportunity part anyway what I'm saying is no I experienced the range and else and there
01:15:43 are many studies on the answer to your question no money does not bring happiness bring money gives you an
01:15:54 ability to make choices does it get in the way in any way of forming those deep meaningful relationships it can there
01:16:03 are lots of ways that it makes negative that's one of them it could stand in the way of that yes okay but I could almost
01:16:11 list the ways that it could stand it could be a problem yeah what does it buy so if you can
01:16:18 elaborate your mission a bit of freedom at the most fundamental level it doesn't take a whole lot but it takes enough
01:16:29 that you can take care of your yourself and your family to be able to learn do the basics of have the relationships
01:16:42 have healthcare the basics of those types of things you know you can cover the patients
01:16:50 and then to have maybe enough security but maybe not too much security that's right yeah that you essentially are okay
01:17:01 okay that is that's really good and you don't that's what a that's what money will get you and everything else is
01:17:06 could go either way well there's more there's more okay then beyond that what it then starts to do
01:17:15 that's the most important thing yes but beyond that what its Tensta much to do is to help to make your dreams happen in
01:17:25 various ways okay so for example now I you know look at my case it's a those dreams might not be just my own dreams
01:17:34 they're their impact on others dreams okay so my own dreams might be I don't know I can pass along these at my
01:17:44 stage in life I could press along these principles to you and I can give those they or I could do whatever I can go on
01:17:54 an adventure I can start a business I can do those other things be productive I can self actualize in ways that might
01:18:05 be not possible otherwise and so that's that's my own belief and then in a dot and I can also help others I mean this
01:18:13 is you know to the extent when you get older and with time and whatever very you start to feel connected spiritual
01:18:19 spirituality is what I'm referring to you can start to have an effect on others that's beneficial and so on
01:18:25 gives you the ability I could tell you that people who are very wealthy who have that a feel that they don't have
01:18:34 enough money Bill Gates will feel almost broke because relative to the things he'd like to accomplish through the
01:18:40 Gates Foundation and things like that you know oh my god he doesn't have enough money to accomplish the things he
01:18:49 wishes for but those things are not you know they're not the most fundamental things so I think that people sometimes
01:18:57 think money has value money doesn't have value the money is like you say just a of exchange in a store although well and
01:19:05 so what you have to say is what is it that you're going to buy now there are other people who get their gratification
01:19:12 in ways that are different from me but I think in many cases that let's say somebody who used money to have a status
01:19:21 symbol I what would I say or that's probably unhealthy but then I don't know somebody who says I love a great
01:19:28 gorgeous painting and it's going to cost lots of money in my priorities mecan't not Kemp get there but but that doesn't
01:19:38 mean I don't who am I to judge others in terms of let's say their elements of the freedom to do those things so it's a
01:19:44 little bit complicated but by and large that you know that's my view on money and wealth so let me ask you in terms of
01:19:55 the idea of so much of your passions and life has been through something you might be able to call work Alan Watts
01:20:04 has this quote he said that the real key to life secret of life is to be completely engaged with what you're
01:20:11 doing in the here and now and instead of calling it work realize that it's play so I'd like to ask what is the role of
01:20:19 work in your life's journey or in a life's journey and what do you think about this modern idea of kind of
01:20:27 separating work and let work-life balance I have a principle that I believe in is make your work in your
01:20:35 passion the same thing ok ok so that's similar face -uh-uh-uh-uh in other words if you can
01:20:40 make your work in your passion it's just gonna work out great and then of course people have different purposes of work
01:20:47 and I don't want to be theoretical about that people have to take care of their family so money at a certain point is
01:20:56 the base is an important component of that work so you look beyond that what is the money gonna get you and what are
01:21:02 you're trying to achieve but the most important thing I agree is meaningful work and meaningful relationships like
01:21:09 if you can get into the thing that you're at your mission that you're on and you are excited about that
01:21:16 mission that you're on and then you can do that with people who you have the meaningful relationships with you have
01:21:23 meaningful work and meaningful relationships I mean that is fabulous for most people and it seems that many
01:21:34 people struggle to get there not out of not necessarily because they're constrained by the fact that
01:21:41 they have the financial constraints of having to provide for their family and so on but it's I mean moat you know this
01:21:50 idea is out there that there needs to be a work-life balance which means that most people on this thing we're going to
01:21:57 return to the same things most doesn't mean optimal but most people seem to not be doing their life's passion not be not
01:22:05 unifying work and passion why do you think that is is well the work-life balance there's a life arc that you go
01:22:15 through starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80 and there is a phase and there's a and you
01:22:21 could look at the different degrees of happiness that happened in those phases I can go through that if that was
01:22:26 interesting but we don't have time probably for it but you get in the part of the life that part of the life which
01:22:35 has the lowest level of happiness is aged 45 to 55 and and and because as you move into this second phase of your life
01:22:46 in the first phase of your life is when you're learning dependent on others second phase of your life is when you're
01:22:53 working and others are dependent on you and you're trying to be successful and in that phase of one's life you
01:23:00 encounter the work-life balance challenge because you're trying to be successful at work and successful at
01:23:07 parenting and successful and successful and all those things that take your demand and they get into that and I
01:23:14 understand that problem in the work/life balance the issue is primarily to know how to approach that okay so I
01:23:23 understand it stressful it produces stress and it produces bad results and it produces the lowest level of happy
01:23:30 in one's life it's interesting as you get later in life the levels of happiness rise in the highest level of
01:23:37 happiness is between ages 70 and 80 which is interesting there are other reasons but in appspot I want and that
01:23:45 and the key to work-life balance is to realize and to learn how to get more out of an hour of life okay because an hour
01:23:58 of work what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice between one thing and another and of course they
01:24:06 they do but they don't realize that if they develop the skill to get a lot more out of an hour it's the equivalent Earl
01:24:16 if-- and so you know that's why in the book principles I try to go into okay now how can you get a lot more out of
01:24:24 out of an hour that allows you to get more life into your life and it reduces the work-life balance and that's the
01:24:32 primary struggle in that 35 to 45 you know if you could linger on that sort of what are the ups and downs of life in
01:24:40 terms of happiness in general and perhaps in your own life when you look back at the moments the peaks it's
01:24:50 pretty pretty much same pattern really in one's life is tends to be a very happy period all the way up and sixteen
01:24:58 is like a really great happy you know I think like myself you start to get elements of freedom you get your
01:25:05 driver's license you know whatever but 16 is there a junior year in high school quite often could be a stressful period
01:25:13 to try to get thing about the high school you go into college tends to be very high
01:25:18 happiness generally speaking freedom and then freedom yeah friendships all of that freedom is a big thing and then you
01:25:28 and then 20 23 is a peak point kind of an unhappy 'no staff freedom then sequentially one has a great time they
01:25:37 date they go out and so on you find the love of your life you begin to develop a family and then with that as time happens you
01:25:46 have more of your work-life balance challenges that come and your responsibilities and then as you get
01:25:53 there in that mid part of your life that is the most that is the biggest struggle chances are you will crash in that
01:26:00 period of time you know you'll have you'll have your series of failures that's the that's that that's when you
01:26:05 go into the abyss you learn you hopefully learn from those mistakes you have to metamorphosis you
01:26:13 come out you change hopefully become better and you take more responsibilities and so on and then when
01:26:21 you get to the later part as you are starting to approach the transition in that late part of the second phase of
01:26:29 your life before you go into the third phase of your life second phase is you're working trying to be successful
01:26:37 third phase of your life is you want people to be successful without you okay yes yeah you want your kids to be
01:26:44 successful without you because when you're at that phase they're at making their transition from the first phase to
01:26:51 the second phase and they're trying to be successful you want them to be successful without you and you have and
01:26:57 your parents are gone and then you have freedom and then you have freedom again and that with that freedom and then you
01:27:05 have these histories shown with this you have friendships you have perspective on life you have different things and
01:27:11 that's one of the reasons that that later part of the life can be real it on average actually it's the highest very
01:27:18 interesting thing if they and they their surveys and say how good do you look and how good do you feel and and that's the
01:27:28 highest survey the person now they not look in the best yeah and they're not feeling the best right maybe it's thirty
01:27:34 five that they're actually looking the best and feeling the best but they rank the highest at that point survey results
01:27:42 of being the highest so that seventy to eighty period of time because it has to do with an attitude on life then you
01:27:49 start to have grandkids Oh grandkids are great and you start to experience that transition well
01:27:56 so that's what the Ark of life pretty much looks like in and I'm experiencing it you know that's good that when you
01:28:05 meditate we're all human or immortal when you meditate it on your own mortality having achieved a lot of
01:28:14 success on whatever dimension what do you think is the meaning of it all the meaning of our short existence on earth
01:28:24 as human beings I think that evolution is the greatest force of in the universe and that were all tiny bits of an
01:28:33 evolutionary type of process where it's just matter and machines that go through time and that we all have a deeply
01:28:46 embedded inclination to evolve and contribute to evolution so I think it's too personally evolved and contribute to
01:28:55 the evolution I could have predicted you would answer that way it's brilliant and exactly right and I think we've said it
01:29:03 before but I'll say it again you have a lot of incredible videos out there that people should definitely watch I don't
01:29:09 say this often I mean it's literally the best spend of time and in terms of reading principles and reading basically
01:29:16 anything you write on LinkedIn and so on there's a really good use of time it's a lot of light bulb moments a lot of
01:29:23 transformative ideas in there so alright thank you so much it's been an honor and I really appreciate it
