00:00:04 many of our viewers have asked us a very serious question what if we made a big pile of bombs and exploded every nuclear
00:00:11 weapon in the world or at once strangely enough we couldn't find a good source to answer this question to our satisfaction
00:00:18 so we gathered together a few scientists to calculate what would happen and find an answer to this extremely important
00:00:25 scientific problem once and for all currently there are 15,000 nuclear weapons on earth the US and Russia both
00:00:33 have around 7,000 well France China the UK Pakistan India Israel and North Korea own around 1,000 between them but how
00:00:41 much destructive power is this really let's try to put these numbers into perspective on earth there are about
00:00:57 4,500 cities or urban areas with at least 100,000 inhabitants some are bigger than others so we'll assume that
00:01:04 on average we need three nuclear bombs to completely wipe out one city this means we could destroy every single city
00:01:11 on planet earth without nuclear arsenal killing more than three billion people roughly half of humanity in an instant
00:01:18 and we'd still have 1,500 nuclear weapons left now that's what an expert would call overkill so we can say with
00:01:25 confidence that we had a lot of nuclear weapons and they can do a lot of damage but what if we make a huge pile of all
00:01:32 15,000 bombs and pull the trigger let's drop our nuclear pile in the middle of the Amazon rainforest just a show nature
00:01:38 who's boss our warheads piled haphazardly fit into a small warehouse a typical US warhead has the power of two
00:01:47 hundred thousand tons of TNT so fifteen thousand warheads would be the equivalent of three billion tons of TNT
00:01:54 for scale this is enough to rebuild the whole island of Manhattan with every building and skyscraper using stacks of
00:02:00 TNT the closest thing we can compare to the energy gathered here is a volcano the deadliest volcanic eruptions in
00:02:08 recorded history took place in 1883 on the island of Krakatoa the eruption was so powerful that 70% of the island and
00:02:14 the surrounding archipelago was destroyed killing tens of thousands of people its effects were felt around the
00:02:21 world four days after the event our nuclear pile contains 15 times the energy of the Krakatoa volcanic eruption
00:02:30 so let's finally push the button three two one in a second a fireball 50 kilometers across vaporizes everything
00:02:39 in its way and creates a blast wave that flattens 3000 square kilometres of forest every living thing within 250
00:02:47 kilometers will start to burn the explosion will be heard literally around the world as the pressure wave circles
00:02:53 the earth tens of times over the next few weeks millions of tons of incinerated material are catapulted into
00:03:00 the atmosphere the mushroom cloud reaches the outer reaches of the stratosphere pushing up against space
00:03:06 itself after things have calmed down a small crater about ten kilometers across is left in the center of the worst world
00:03:12 fires the planets has seen in millenia spreading throughout South America burning down forests and cities alike
00:03:19 and now the unpleasant part begins extremely radioactive material will kill living things very quickly and a large
00:03:25 area several kilometers around the crater is now uninhabitable as is everywhere for hundreds of kilometers
00:03:31 downwind much of the fallout is carried high into the atmosphere by the mushroom cloud and carried around the planet the
00:03:38 amount of radioactive material in the environment doubles worldwide which still isn't civilization ending but we
00:03:44 may see more cancer for a while a portion of the particles will flow to the edge of space for years and cause a
00:03:50 nuclear winter that could lower global temperatures by a few degrees for a few years this explosion was pretty bad if
00:03:56 you're in South America and especially Brazil the Amazon rainforest is pretty much history which is not great but
00:04:03 human life will go on okay but what if we explode more nuclear weapons let's suppose humanity decided
00:04:11 to mine every bit of uranium on earth and build as many nuclear bombs as possible at current usage it's estimated
00:04:18 that there are around 35 million tons of uranium in Earth's crust enough to power human civilization for over 2,000 years
00:04:26 or to build millions of nuclear warheads for the sake of argument let's say we create a pile with the yield of 10
00:04:32 billion Hiroshima bombs which makes up a cube three kilometers high that contains roughly the energy of the asteroid
00:04:38 impact that ended the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago except it's also nuclear three to one how pile
00:04:50 explodes in a fireball stretching so high into the sky that it's visible from half of South
00:04:55 America with so much power that the ground just splashes like water forming a crater 100 kilometers across bedrock
00:05:03 on the scale of whole mountain ranges is vaporized in an instant while thousands of tons of material is catapulted away
00:05:09 with such speed that it's ejected into space some leaves earth forever while most of it comes raining down as hot
00:05:15 burning debris that heats up the atmosphere to oven-like temperatures killing most big animals and causing
00:05:22 fire storms all over the world the Earth's crust rings like a bell struck by global earthquakes stronger than
00:05:29 anything in recorded history decimating cities around the world while hurricane-force winds flatten every
00:05:34 single tree in South America and wildfires consume the continents the abundance of hydrocarbons in the Amazon
00:05:41 burn to form ash are cast into the atmosphere darting the sky and keeping sunlight from reaching the surface dropping
00:05:47 temperatures to near freezing worldwide the ensuing global winter may last for decades and results in the extinction of every
00:05:56 large animal species humans included we could also mention that every corner of the planet is covered with radioactive
00:06:01 fallout but at this point it doesn't matter that much anymore this is humanity's extinction event the
00:06:08 astronauts aboard the international space station get to enjoy a great view for a while but it's not unlikely that
00:06:14 the spray of rocks blast into orbit will destroy the station those lucky enough to be in bunkers or in submarines deep
00:06:21 below the ocean surface may survive the longest before they exhaust their food supplies and have to venture out for
00:06:27 more they'll find the world a charred freezing radioactive wasteland the planet itself doesn't care at all after
00:06:35 just a few million years the wounds of the explosions have healed and life is thriving arguably even more so than when
00:06:42 humans were around if intelligent life emerges again it might be able to work out what happened when they study
00:06:49 geology they'll find a bizarre and very thin layer of rock covering the entire world enriched in radioactive elements
00:06:55 like uranium and the other nasty things it decay sooo mixed with rare earth metals and plastics that humans used
00:07:02 they would probably be very very confused videos like this one take well over 1200 hours to finish over the years
00:07:12 we put more and more effort into research conversations with experts illustration and animation sound design
00:07:17 and fact-checking for this video we put a lot of extra work into our sources document you can
00:07:23 read how we got to the information in the video what our experts thought about it where they disagreed with each other
00:07:30 we can take the time to do this because of you our viewers because you watch and share our videos by our posters and
00:07:40 support us on patreon com if you like what we're doing please consider becoming a patron or get one of the nice
