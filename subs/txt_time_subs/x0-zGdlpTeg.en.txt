00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Regina Bardsley she's a professor at MIT and a world-class researcher in natural
00:00:09 language processing and applications of deep learning to chemistry and oncology or the use of deep learning for early
00:00:16 diagnosis prevention and treatment of cancer she has also been recognized for teaching of several successful AI
00:00:25 related courses at MIT including the popular introduction to machine learning course this is the artificial

00:00:40 simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri D ma a.m. and now here's my conversation with
00:00:48 Regina Bosley in an interview you've mentioned that if there's one course you would take it
00:00:53 would be a literature course for the friend of yours that a friend of your teachers just out of curiosity because I
00:01:00 couldn't find anything on it are there books or ideas that had profound impact on your life journey books and ideas
00:01:08 perhaps outside of computer science and the technical fields I think because I'm spending a lot of my time at MIT and
00:01:16 previously in other institutions where I was a student I have limited ability to interact with people so a lot of what I
00:01:23 know about the world actually comes from books and they were quite enough of books that had profound impact on me and
00:01:31 how I view the world let me just give you one example of such a book I've maybe a year ago read a book called the
00:01:42 emperor of all maladies it's a book about it's kind of a history of science book on how the treatments and drugs for
00:01:52 cancer were developed and that book despite the fact that I am in the business of science really opened my
00:02:00 eyes on how imprecise and imperfect the discovery process is and how imperfect our current solutions and what makes
00:02:11 science succeed and be implemented and sometimes it's actually known the strengths of the idea but devotion of
00:02:16 the person who wants to see it implemented so this is one of the books and you know at least for the last year
00:02:23 quite changed the way I'm thinking about scientific process just from the historical perspective and what do I
00:02:31 need to do to make my ideas really implemented let me give you an example of a book which is not kind of which is
00:02:41 a fiction book is a book called this is a book about a young female student who comes from Africa to study
00:02:54 in the United States and it describes her paths you know was in her studies and her life transformation that you
00:03:04 know in a new country and kind of adaptation to a new culture and when I read this book I saw myself in many
00:03:15 different points of it but but it also kind of gave me the lens on different events and some event that I never
00:03:22 actually paid attention one the funny stories in this book is how she arrives to to her new college and she starts
00:03:33 speaking in English and she had this beautiful British accent because that's how she was educated in her country and
00:03:42 this is not my case and then she notices that the person who talks to her you don't talk to her in a very funny way in
00:03:48 a very slow way and she's thinking that this woman is disabled in a and she's also trying to kind of talk a date
00:03:55 huh and then after a while when she finishes her discussion with this officer from her college she sees how
00:04:01 she interacts with the other students with American students and he discovers that actually she talked to her this way
00:04:10 because she saw that she doesn't understand English and I he said wow this is a fine experience and he
00:04:20 literally within few weeks I went to to LA to a conference and they asked somebody in the airport you know how to
00:04:27 find like a cab or something and then I noticed this person is talking in a very strange way and my first thought was and
00:04:33 this person have some you know pronunciation issues or something and I'm trying to talk very slowly to him an
00:04:38 average with another professor and Frankel and he's like laughing because it's funny that I don't get that the guy
00:04:46 is talking it in this way because he think that I cannot speak so it was really kind of mirroring experience as
00:04:53 it is let me think a lot about my own experiences moving you know from different countries so I
00:05:00 think that books play a big role in my understanding of the world on the on the science question you mentioned that it
00:05:08 made you discover that personalities of human beings are more important than perhaps ideas is that what I heard it's
00:05:15 not necessarily that they are more important than ideas but I think that ideas on their own
00:05:23 unknown sufficient and many times at least at the local horizon is the personalities and their devotion to
00:05:30 their ideas is really the locally changes the landscape now if you're looking at AI like let's say 30 years ago
00:05:39 you know Dark Ages of AI or whatever what the symbolic times you can use anyone you know there is some people now
00:05:46 we're looking at a lot of that work and we're kind of thinking this is not really maybe a relevant work but you can
00:05:53 see that some people manage to take it and to make it so shiny and dominate the you know the academic world and make it
00:06:03 to be the standards if you look in the area of natural language processing it is well known fact and the reason the
00:06:11 statistics in NLP took such a long time to became to become mainstream because there were quite a number of
00:06:17 personalities which didn't believe in this idea and it stopped research progress in this area so I do not think
00:06:27 that you know can asymptotically maybe personalities matters but I think locally it does make quite a bit of
00:06:37 impact okay generally you know speed adds speed up the rate of adoption of the new ideas yeah and and the other interesting
00:06:45 question is in the early days of particular discipline I think you mentioned in in that book was is
00:06:52 ultimately a book of cancer it's called the Emperor of all maladies yeah the yep and those maladies included
00:06:59 the trying to the medicine was the center arm so it was actually centered on you know how people sort of curing
00:07:08 cancer like like for me it was really a disc how people what was the science of chemistry behind drug development that
00:07:17 it actually grew up out of the dyeing like coloring industry that people who developed chemistry in 19th century in
00:07:26 Germany and Britain - do you know the really new dyes they looked at the molecular and identified it they do
00:07:33 certain things to cells and from there the process started and you know like histology thing yeah this is fascinating
00:07:38 that they managed to make the connection and look under the microscope and do all this discovery but as you continue
00:07:47 reading about it and you read about how chemotherapy drugs socially developed in Boston and some of them were developed
00:07:56 and Farber dr. Farber from Dana Farber you know how the experiments were done that you know there was some
00:08:04 miscalculation let's put it this way and they tried it on the patients and then just and those were children with
00:08:10 leukemia and they died and they tried another modification you look at the process how imperfect is this process
00:08:17 and you don't like it well again looking back like six years ago 70 years ago you can kind of understand it but some of
00:08:23 the stories in this book which were really shocking to me we're really happening you know maybe decades ago and
00:08:31 we still don't have a vehicle to do it much more fast and effective and you know scientific the way of taking
00:08:38 computer science scientific so from the perspective of computer science you've gotten chance to work the application to
00:08:45 cancer and to medicine in general from a perspective of an engineer and a computer scientist how far along are we
00:08:51 from understanding the human body biology of being able to manipulate it in a way we can cure some of the
00:09:00 melodies some of the diseases so this is very interesting question and if you're thinking is a computer scientist about
00:09:09 this problem I think one of the reasons that we succeeded in the areas we as a computer scientist succeeded is because
00:09:17 we don't have we are not trying to understand in some ways like if you're thinking about like e-commerce Amazon I was
00:09:24 doesn't really understand you and that's why it recommends you certain books or certain products correct and in you know
00:09:35 traditionally when people were thinking about marketing you know they divided the population to different kind of
00:09:41 subgroups identify the features of this subgroup and come up with a strategy which is specific to that subgroup if
00:09:46 you're looking about recommendation system they're not claiming they understanding somebody they're just
00:09:53 managing to from the patterns of your behavior to recommend you a product now if you look at the traditional Biogen
00:10:03 obviously I wouldn't say that I at any way you know educated in this field but you know what I see there is really a
00:10:10 lot of emphasis on mechanistic understanding and it was very surprising to me coming from computer science how
00:10:16 much emphasis is on this understanding and given the complexity of the system maybe the deterministic full
00:10:24 understanding of this processes is you know beyond our capacity and the same ways in computer science when we doing
00:10:31 recognition when you recommendation in many other areas it's just probabilistic matching process and in some way maybe
00:10:41 in certain cases we shouldn't even attempt to understand we can attempt to understand but in parallel we can
00:10:48 actually do this kind of matching that would help us to find you out to do early diagnostics and so on and I know
00:10:56 that in these communities it's really important to understand but I am sometimes wondering what exactly does it
00:11:03 mean to understand here well there's stuff that works and but that can be like you said separate from this deep
00:11:11 human desire to uncover the mysteries of the universe of of science of the way the body works the way the mind works
00:11:19 it's the dream of symbolic AI of being able to reduce human knowledge into into logic and be able to play with that
00:11:28 logic in a way that's very explainable and understandable for us humans I mean that's a beautiful dream so I understand
00:11:35 it but it seems that what seems to work today we'll talk about it more as as much as possible reduced stuff into Data reduce
00:11:43 whatever problem you're interested in to data and try to apply statistical methods flat machine learning to that on
00:11:52 a personal note you were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 what it facing your mortality make you think about how
00:12:01 did they change you know this is a great question and I think that I was interviewed many times nobody actually
00:12:08 asked me this question I think I was 43 at a time and if the first time I realized in my life that I may die and I
00:12:15 never thought about it before and yeah and there was a long time since you diagnosed until you're sure you know
00:12:19 what you have and have CV is your disease for me it was like maybe two and a half months and I didn't know where I am
00:12:28 during this time because it was getting different tests and one would say it's bad and I would say no it is not so
00:12:35 until I knew where I am I really was thinking about all these different possible outcomes were you imagining the
00:12:40 worst or were you trying to be optimistic or it would be really I don't remember you know what was my thinking
00:12:49 it was really a mixture with many components at the time at speaking you know in our terms and one thing that I
00:13:00 remember and you know every test comes and you're saying oh it could be this so it may not be this and you're hopeful
00:13:05 then you're disparate so it's like if there is a whole you know slow of emotions it goes through but what I
00:13:14 remember is that when I came back to MIT I was kind of going the whole times to the treatment to MIT but was brain was
00:13:20 not really there but when I came back here I finished went to each one that I was here teaching and everything yeah I
00:13:27 look back at what my group was doing what other groups was doing and I saw these trivialities it's like people are
00:13:34 building their careers on improving some parts around two or three percent or whatever I was like seriously I did a
00:13:40 walk on how to decipher Ugaritic like a languages nobody speak and and whatever like what is significance when I was sad
00:13:49 and you know I walked out of MIT which is you know when people really do care you know what happened to you I clear favor
00:13:54 is you know what is your next publication to ACL to the world where people you know people you see a lot of
00:14:03 sufferings that I'm kind of totally shouldered on it on daily basis and it's like the first time I've seen like real
00:14:10 life and real suffering and I was thinking why are we trying to improve the parser or deal with some
00:14:18 trivialities when we have capacity to really make a change and it was really challenging to me because on one hand
00:14:25 you know I have my graduate students really want to do their papers and their work and they want to continue to do
00:14:31 what they were doing which was great and then it was me who really kind of reevaluated what is the importance and
00:14:39 also at that point because I had to take some break I look back into like my years in science and I was thinking you
00:14:51 know like 10 years ago this was the biggest thing I don't know topic models that we have like millions of papers on
00:14:56 topic models and variation topics models now it's really like irrelevant and you you start looking at this you know what
00:15:03 do you perceive as important a different point of time and how you know it's fades over time and since we have a
00:15:14 limited time all of us have limited time unless it's really important to prioritize things that really matter to
00:15:20 you maybe matter to you at that particular point but is important to take some time and understand what
00:15:27 matters to you which may not necessarily be the same as what matters to the rest of your scientific community and pursue
00:15:36 that vision so though that moment did it make you cognizant you mentioned suffering of just the general amount of
00:15:44 suffering in the world is that what you're referring to so as opposed to topic models and specific detail
00:15:52 problems in NLP did did you start to think about other people who have been diagnosed with cancer that the way you
00:15:59 saw the started to see the world perhaps oh absolutely and it actually creates because for instance you know these parts of the
00:16:06 treatment where you need to go to the hospital every day and you see you know the community of people that you see and
00:16:15 many of them are much worse then I I was at a time and you're over sad and see it all and people who are happy as some day
00:16:25 just because they feel better and for people who are in our normal every aisle you take it totally for granted that you
00:16:31 feel well that if you decide to go running you can go running and you can you know you're pretty much free to do
00:16:38 whatever you want with your body like I saw like a community my community became those people and I remember one of my
00:16:48 friends Dena kitabi took me to Prudential to buy me a gift for my birthday and it was like the first time
00:16:54 in months I said I went to kind of to see other people and I was like wow first of all these people you know
00:16:59 they're happy and they're laughing and they're very different from this other my people and second of singing I think
00:17:05 it totally crazy they're like laughing and wasting their money on some stupid gifts and you know they may die they
00:17:14 already may have cancer and and they don't understand it so you can really see how the mind changes that you can
00:17:23 see that you know before that you can have didn't you know that you're gonna die of course I knew but it was kind of
00:17:29 a theoretical notion it wasn't something which was concrete and at that point when you really see it and see how
00:17:37 little means some time the system has to hummed and you really feel that we need to take a lot of our brilliance that we
00:17:46 have here at MIT and translated into something useful yeah and you so couldn't have a lot of
00:17:51 definitions but of course alleviating suffering alleviating trying to cure cancer is a beautiful mission so I of
00:18:01 course know the theoretically the notion of cancer but just reading more and more about its 1.7 million new cancer cases
00:18:10 in the United States every year 600,000 cancer related deaths every year so this has a huge impact United States global
00:18:22 when broadly before we talk about how machine learning how MIT can help when do you think we as a civilization will
00:18:33 cure cancer how hard of a problem is it from everything you've learned from it recently I cannot really assess it what
00:18:41 I do believe will happen with the advancement in machine learning that a lot of types of cancer we will be able
00:18:48 to predict way early and more effectively utilize existing treatments I think I hope at least that
00:18:58 with all the advancements in AI and drug discovery we would be able to much faster find relevant molecules what I'm
00:19:07 not sure about is how long it will take the medical establishment and regulatory bodies to kind of catch up and to
00:19:15 implement it and they think this is a very big piece of puzzle that is currently not addressed the see really
00:19:23 interesting question so first a small detail that I think the answer is yes but is cancer one of one of the diseases
00:19:33 that when detected earlier that significantly improves the outcomes it's so like because we will talk about
00:19:41 there's the cure and then there is detection and I think while machine learning can really help is earlier
00:19:48 detection so the detection help prediction is crucial for instance the vast majority of pancreatic cancer
00:19:55 patients are detected at the stage they are incurable that's why they have such a you know terrible survival rate it's
00:20:06 like just few percent over five years it's pretty much today a death sentence but if you can discover this disease
00:20:16 early there are mechanisms to treat it and in fact I know a number of people who were diagnosed and saved just
00:20:23 because they had food poisoning they had terrible food poisoning they went to our and they got scan there were early
00:20:30 science on the scan that would save their lives but this wasn't really an accidental case so as
00:20:40 we become better we would be able to help too many more people that have you know that are likely to develop diseases
00:20:49 and I just want to say that as I got more into this field I realize that you know countries of course terrible
00:20:55 disease but they're really the whole slew of terrible diseases out there like neurodegenerative diseases and others so
00:21:04 we of course a lot of us are fixated on cancer just because it's so prevalent in our society and you see these people and
00:21:08 there are a lot of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and that kind of aging diseases that we still don't
00:21:21 have a good solution for and we you know and I felt as a computer scientist we kind of decided that it's other people's
00:21:28 job to treat these diseases because it's like traditionally people in biology or in chemistry or and these are the ones
00:21:36 who's thinking about it and after kind of start paying attention I think that it's really a wrong assumption and we
00:21:44 all need to join the bottle so how it seems like in cancer specifically that there's a lot of ways that machine
00:21:50 learning can help so what's what's the role of machine learning in the diagnosis of cancer so for many cancers
00:22:00 today we really don't know what is your likelihood to get cancer and for the vast majority of patients
00:22:08 especially on the younger patients it really comes as a surprise like for instance for breast cancer 80% of the
00:22:13 patients are first in their families it's like me and I never thought that I had any increased risk because you don't
00:22:21 nobody had it in my family and for some reason in my head it was kind of inherited disease
00:22:28 but even if I would pay attention the the models that currently this is very simplistic statistical models that are
00:22:34 currently used that in clinical practice it really don't give you an answer so you don't know and the same pancreatic
00:22:42 cancer the same truth for non-smoking one cancer and many others so what machine learning can do here is
00:22:51 utilize all this data to tell us le who is like it'll be susceptible and using all the information that is already
00:22:59 there beat imaging beat your other tests and you know eventually liquid biopsies and others where the signal itself is
00:23:09 not sufficiently strong for human eye to do good discrimination because the signal may be weak but by combining many
00:23:16 sources machine which is trained on large volumes of data can really detect it early and that what we've seen with
00:23:23 breast cancer and people are reporting it in other diseases as well that really boils down to data right and in the
00:23:30 different kinds of sources of data and you mentioned regulatory challenges so what are the challenges in gathering
00:23:41 large data sets in the space again another great question so it took me after I decided that I want to work on
00:23:53 like right now in this country there is no publicly available data set of modern mammograms that you can just go on your
00:24:01 computer sign a document and get it it just doesn't exist I mean in obviously every hospital has its own collection of
00:24:09 mammograms there are data that come out if they came out of clinical trials what we're talking about here is a computer
00:24:16 scientist who just want to run his or her model and see how it works this data like imagenet doesn't exist and they you
00:24:27 know there is an e said which is called like florida data set which is a film mammogram from 90s which is totally not
00:24:33 representative of the current developments whatever you're learning on them doesn't scale up this is the only
00:24:39 resource that is available and today there are many agencies that govern access to data like the hospital
00:24:47 holds your data and the hospital decides whether they would give it to the researcher to walk with this data
00:24:54 individual hospital yeah I mean the hospital may you know assume is that you're doing a surgical operation you
00:25:02 can submit you know there is appropriate prove all process guided by IRB and you if you go through all the processes you
00:25:09 can eventually get access to the data but if you yourself know I community they don't know that many people
00:25:16 culturally ever go to access to data because it's very challenging process and Sarge isn't a quick comment eat MGH
00:25:25 or any kind of hospital are they scanning the data that they digitally storing it oh it is already digitally
00:25:32 stored you don't need to do any extra processing steps it's already there in the right format is that all right now
00:25:40 there are a lot of issues that govern access to the data because the hospital is legally responsible for for the data
00:25:51 and you know they have a lot to lose if they give the data to the wrong person but they may not have a lot to gain if
00:25:57 they gave it as a hospital as a legal entity as giving it to you and the way you know whatever dimension happening in
00:26:04 the future is the same thing that happens when you're getting your driving license you can decide whether you want
00:26:10 to donate your organs so you can imagine that whenever a person goes to the hospital they it should be easy for them
00:26:18 to the name their data for research and it can be different kind of do they only give you your test results or only
00:26:24 mammogram only imaging data or the whole medical record because at the end we all will benefit from all this
00:26:34 insights and it's not like you say I want to keep my data private but I would really love to get it you know from
00:26:39 other people because other people think in the same way so if there is a mechanism to do this the nation and and
00:26:48 the patient has an ability to say how they want to use their data for research it would be really a game-changer
00:26:55 people when they think about this problem there's a it depends on the population the pains and the
00:27:01 demographics but there's some privacy concerns generally we're not just medical data just say any kind of data
00:27:08 it's what you said my data it should belong kind of to me I'm worried how it's going to be misused how how do we
00:27:17 alleviate those concerns is that seems like a problem that needs to be that problem of trust of transparency needs
00:27:24 to be solved before we build large data sets that help detect cancer help save those very people and there in the
00:27:31 future so similar to things that could be done there is a technical solutions and there are societal solutions so on
00:27:44 the technical and we today have ability to improve disambiguation like for instance for imaging it's you
00:27:53 know for imaging you can do it pretty well what's this ambiguous and it's removing the identification removing the names of
00:28:03 the people there are other data like if it isn't Rotax you cannot really achieve 99.9 percent but there are all these
00:28:10 techniques that I should some of them I developed at MIT how you can do learning on the encode the data where you locally
00:28:18 encode the image you train on network which only works on the encoded on encoded images and then you send the
00:28:25 outcome back to the hospital and you can open it up so those are the technical solution there are a lot of people who
00:28:31 are walking in this space where the learning happens in the encoded form I we're still early but this is the
00:28:39 interesting research area what I think will make more progress there is a lot of work in natural
00:28:46 language processing community how to do the identification better but even today there already a lot of data which can be
00:28:56 de-identified perfectly like your test data for instance correct where you can just you know the name of the patient
00:29:02 you just want to extract the part with the numbers the big problem here is again hospitals don't see much incentive
00:29:12 to give this data away on one hand and then it is general concern now when I'm talking about societal benefits and
00:29:22 about the education the public needs to understand that I think that there are situation and I still remember myself
00:29:32 when I really needed an answer I had to make a choice there was no information to make a choice you're just guessing
00:29:39 and at that moment you feel that your life is at the stake but you just don't have information to make the choice and
00:29:48 many times when I give talks I get emails from women who say you know I'm in this situation can you please run
00:29:56 statistic and see what are the outcomes we get almost every week a mammogram that comes by me to my office at MIT I'm serious
00:30:06 that people ask to run because they need to make you know life-changing decisions and of course you know I'm not planning
00:30:14 to open a clinic here but we do run and give them the results for their doctors but the point that I'm trying to make
00:30:23 that we all at some point or our loved ones will be in the situation where you need information to make the best choice
00:30:31 and if this information is not available you would feel vulnerable and unprotected and then the question is you
00:30:38 know what do I care more because at the end everything is a trainer of correct yeah exactly
00:30:44 just out of curiosity what it seems like one possible solution I'd like to see what you think of it
00:30:50 based on what you just said based on wanting to know answers for anyone urine yourself in that situation is it
00:30:57 possible for patients to own their data as opposed to hospitals owning their data of course theoretically I guess
00:31:04 patients own their data but can you walk out there with the USB stick containing everything or uploaded to the cloud
00:31:13 we're a company you know I remember Microsoft had a service like I try I was be really excited about and Google
00:31:20 health was there I tried to give and I was excited about it basically companies helping you upload your data to the
00:31:27 cloud so that you can move from hospital to hospital from Doctor to doctor do you see a promise of that kind of
00:31:34 possibility I absolutely think this is you know the right way to to exchange the data
00:31:39 I don't know now who is the biggest player in this field but I can clearly see that even you know for even for
00:31:47 totally selfish health reasons when you are going to a new facility and many of us ascend to some specialized treatment
00:31:54 they don't easily have access to your data and today you know we wouldn't want to send this mammogram need to go to the
00:32:01 hospital find some small office which give them that CD and they ship as the CDC you can imagine we're looking at the
00:32:07 kind of decades-old mechanism of data exchange so I definitely think this is in the
00:32:17 area where hopefully all the right regulatory and technical forces will align and we will see it actually
00:32:24 implemented it's sad because unfortunately and I have I need to research why that happened but I'm
00:32:30 pretty sure Google Health and Microsoft's HealthVault or whatever it's called both closed down which means that
00:32:37 there was either regulatory pressure or there's not a business case or there's challenges from hospitals which is very
00:32:44 disappointing so when you say you don't know what the biggest players are the two biggest that I was aware of close
00:32:52 the doors so I'm hoping  I'd love to see why and I'd love to see who else can come up it seems like one of those Elon
00:33:00 Musk style problems that are obvious needs to be solved and somebody needs to step up and actually do this large-scale
00:33:08 data collection I know that is an initiative in Massachusetts the thing that you led by the governor to try to
00:33:14 create this kind of house exchange system or at least to help people who kind of when you show up in emergency
00:33:20 room and there is no information about what our ologists and other things so I drove how far it will go
00:33:28 but another thing is you said and I find it very interesting it's actually who are the successful players in this space
00:33:36 and the whole implementation how does it go two meters from the anthropological perspective it's more fascinating that
00:33:44 AI that today goes in healthcare you know we've seen so many you know attempts and so very little successes
00:33:52 and it's interesting to understand that I've by no means you know have knowledge to assess why we are in the position
00:34:00 where we are yeah it's interesting as a data is really fuel for a lot of successful applications and when that
00:34:08 data requires regulatory approval like the FDA or any kind of approval it's seems that the computer scientists are
00:34:17 not quite there yet in being able to play the regular game understanding the fundamentals of it I think that in many
00:34:25 cases when even people do you have data we still don't know what exactly do you need to demonstrate
00:34:35 to change the standard of care well like let me give you example related to my breast cancer research so traditional in
00:34:43 traditional breast cancer risk assessment there is something called density which determines the likelihood
00:34:51 of a woman to get cancer and this is pretty much this how much white do you see on the mammogram the white say it is
00:34:57 and the more likely the tissue is dense and the idea behind density it's not a bad idea in 1967 a radiologist called
00:35:08 wolf decided to look back at women who were diagnosed and see what is special in the images can we look back and says
00:35:14 that they're likely to develop so he come up with some patters it was the best that his human I can you know can
00:35:21 identify then it was kind of formalized and coded into four categories and that what we are using today and today this
00:35:31 density assessment is actually a federal law from 2019 they're approved by President Trump and for the previous FDA
00:35:41 Commissioner where women are supposed to be advised by their providers if they have high density putting them into
00:35:49 high-risk category and in some states you can actually get supplementary screening paid by your insurance because
00:35:54 you are in this category now you can say how much science do we have behind it whatever biological science or
00:36:01 epidemiological evidence so it turns out that between 40 and 50 percent of women have dense breasts so about 40 percent
00:36:10 of patients are coming out of their screening and somebody tells them you are in high risk now what exactly does
00:36:18 it mean if you as half of the population high risk its recede maybe I'm not you know what do I really need to do with it
00:36:27 because the system doesn't provide me a lot of the solutions because there are so many people like me we cannot really
00:36:33 provide very expensive solutions for them and the reason this whole density became this big deal it's actually advocated by
00:36:42 the patients who felt very unprotected because many women when did the mammograms which were normal and then it
00:36:48 turns out that they already had cancer quite developed cancer so they didn't have a way to know who is really at risk
00:36:55 and what is the likelihood it when the doctor tells you you're okay you are not okay well at the time and it was you
00:37:02 know 15 years ago this maybe was the best piece of science that we had and it took you know quite 1516 years to make
00:37:14 it federal law but now that this is this is a standard now within the planning model we can so much more accurately
00:37:21 predict who is gonna develop breast cancer just because you're trained on a logical thing and instead of describing
00:37:26 how much white and what kind of white machine can systematically identify the patterns which was the original idea
00:37:33 behind the sort of the traditions machinists can do it much more systematically and predict the risk when
00:37:38 you train the machine to look at the image and to say the risk in one to five years now you can ask me how long it
00:37:46 will take to substitute this density which is broadly used across the country and I really it's not helping to bring
00:37:55 this new models and I would say it's not a matter of the algorithm algorithm is already orders of magnitude better the
00:38:00 thought is currently in practice I think it's really the question who do you need to convince how many hospitals do you
00:38:08 need to run the experiment both you know all this mechanism of adoption and how do you explain to patients and to women
00:38:19 across the country that this is really a better measure and again I don't think it's in AI question we can walk more and
00:38:26 make the algorithm even better but I don't think that this is the current you know the barrier the barrier is really
00:38:33 this other piece that for some reason is not really explored it's like anthropological trees and coming back to
00:38:41 a question about books there is a book that I am reading it's called American sickness by
00:38:49 Elizabeth was in town and I got this book from my clinical collaborator dr. Connie Limon and I said I know
00:38:54 everything that I need to know about American health system but you know every page doesn't fail to surprise me
00:39:01 and I think there is a lot of interesting and really deep lessons for people like us from computer science who
00:39:09 are coming into this field to really understand how complex is the system of incentives in the system to understand
00:39:18 how you really need to play to drive adoption you just said it's complex but if we're trying to simplify it who do
00:39:26 you think most likely would be successful if we push on this group of people is that the doctors is it the
00:39:32 hospitals is it the governments of policymakers is it the individual patients consumers who needs to be
00:39:44 inspired to most likely lead to adoption or is there no simple answer there's no simple answer but I think there is a lot
00:39:52 of good people in medical system who do want you know to make a change and I think a lot of power will come
00:40:02 from us as a consumers because we all are consumers or future consumers of healthcare services and I think we can
00:40:13 do so much more in explaining the potential and not in the hype terms and not saying that we now killed all
00:40:18 antimatter and you know I'm really sick of reading this kind of articles which made these claims but really to show
00:40:25 with some examples what this implementation does and how it changes the care because I can't imagine doesn't
00:40:32 matter what kind of politician it is you know we all are susceptible to these diseases there is no one who is free and
00:40:40 eventually you know we all are humans and we're looking for way to alleviate the suffering and and this is one
00:40:48 possible way where we can't the underutilizing which i think can help so it sounds like the biggest problems are
00:40:56 outside of AI in terms of the biggest impact at this point but are there any open problems in the application of ml
00:41:04 to oncology in general so improving the detection or any other creative methods whether it's on the detection
00:41:10 segmentations of the vision perception side or some other clever of inference yeah what would it in general in youth
00:41:19 any of you are the open problems in this space yeah I just want to mention sit beside detection another area what I am
00:41:25 kind of quite active and I think it's really an increasingly important area in house care is drug design
00:41:36 because you know it's fine if you detect something early but you still need to get you know to get drugs and new drugs
00:41:45 for these conditions and today all of the drug design ml is non-existent that we don't have any drug that was
00:41:53 developed by their male model or even not developed by at least even you that ml model plays a significant role I
00:42:03 think this area was all the new ability to generate molecules with desired properties to do in silica screening is
00:42:11 really a big open area in to be totally honest with you now when we are doing diagnostics and imaging primarily taking
00:42:17 the ideas that we develop for other areas and you applying them with some adaptation the area of you know drug
00:42:26 design is very technically interesting and exciting area you need to work a lot with graphs and capture various 3d
00:42:35 properties there are lots and lots of opportunities to be technically creative and I think there are a lot of open
00:42:46 questions in this area you know we're already getting a lot of successes even you know with the kind of the first
00:42:53 generation of this models but there is much more new creative things that you can do and what's very nice to see is it
00:43:00 actually the you know the the more powerful the more interesting models actually do do better so there is a place to to
00:43:11 innovate in machine learning in this area and some of these techniques are really unique to let's say to you know
00:43:20 graph generation and other things so what just an interpreter quick I'm sorry graph generation or graphs drug
00:43:30 discovery in general what's what how do you discover a drug is this chemistry is this trying to predict different
00:43:39 chemical reactions or is it some kind of water graphs even represented in this paper and what's a drug okay so let's
00:43:47 say you think there are many different types of drugs but let's say you're gonna talk about small molecules because
00:43:52 I think today the majority of drugs are small molecules so small molecule is a graph the molecule is just where the
00:44:00 node in the graph is an atom and then you have the bone so it's really a graph representation if you look at it in 2d correct
00:44:07 you can do it 3d but let's say well let's keep it simple and stick in 2d so pretty much my understanding today how
00:44:17 it is done a scale in the companies you're without machine learning you have high throughput screening so you know
00:44:24 that you are interested to get certain biological activity over the compound so you scan a lot of compounds like maybe
00:44:31 hundreds of thousands some really big number of compounds you identify some compounds which have the right activity
00:44:37 and then at this point you know the chemists come and they're trying to now to optimize this original heat to
00:44:46 different properties that you want it to be maybe soluble you want to decrease tax ECG you want to decrease the side
00:44:54 effects against your dropper can that be done in simulation or just by looking at the molecules or do you need to actually
00:45:02 run reactions and real labs with lab it is so when you do high throughput screening you really do screening it's
00:45:08 in the lab it's it's really the lab screening you screen the molecules corrected screening you just check them
00:45:15 for certain property like in the physical space in the physical world like actually there's a machine probably
00:45:20 that's doing some actually running the race actually running reactions yeah so so there is a process where you can run
00:45:26 in this race go high through bodily you know it become cheaper and faster to do it and very big number of molecules you
00:45:37 run the screaming you identify potential you know potential good starts and then we're the chemists come in who you know
00:45:44 I've done it many times and then they can try to look at it and say how can I change the Millennial to get the desired
00:45:53 profile in terms of all other properties so maybe how do you make it more by octave and so on and they're you know
00:46:01 the creativity of the chemist really is the one the determines the success of this design because again they have a
00:46:10 lot of domain knowledge you know what works how do you decrease the CCD and so on and that's what they do so all the
00:46:18 drugs that are currently you know in the fda-approved Iraq serving drugs that are in clinical trials they are designed
00:46:28 using these domain experts which goes through this combinatorial space of molecular graphs or whatever and find
00:46:34 the right one now adjust it to be the right ones sounds like the the breast density
00:46:39 heuristic from sixty seven the same echoes it's unnecessary is that it's really you know it's really driven by
00:46:46 deep understand it so like they just observe it I mean they do deeply understand chemistry and they do
00:46:51 understand how different groups and how does it changes the properties so there is a lot of science it gets into it and
00:46:59 a lot of kind of simulation how do you want it to behave it eats very very complex they're quite effective at this is no
00:47:08 effective yeah we have drugs like a spinning in how do you measure effect if if you measure it's in terms of cost its
00:47:14 prohibitive if you measure the incidence of times you know we have lots of diseases for which we don't have any
00:47:19 drugs and we don't even know how to approach and don't need to mention few drugs on your generative disease drugs
00:47:27 that fail you know so there are lots of you know trials of face you know in later stages which is really
00:47:34 catastrophic from the financial perspective so you know is it is it the effective the most effective mechanism
00:47:41 absolutely no but this is the only one that currently works and I would you know I was closely interacting was
00:47:49 fueling pharmaceutical industry I was really fascinating on how sharp and and what a deep understanding of the domain
00:47:56 do they have it's not an observation driven it's there is really a lot of science behind what they do but if you
00:48:02 ask me can machine learning change it I firmly believe yes because even the most experienced chemist cannot you know hold
00:48:11 in their memory and understanding ever since you can learn you know from millions of molecules and reactions and
00:48:19 and this piece of grass is a totally new space I mean it's a it's a really interesting space for machine learning
00:48:24 to explore graph generation yeah so there's a lot of thing that you can do here so we do a lot of work so the first
00:48:32 tool that we started with was the tool that can predict properties of the molecules so you can just give the
00:48:39 molecular molecule and the property it can be by activity property or it can be some other property and you train the
00:48:49 molecules and you can now take a new molecule and predict this property now when people started working in this area
00:48:56 it is something very simple and they're kind of existing you know fingerprints which is kind of handcrafted features of
00:49:02 the molecule when you break the graph to substructures and then you run it in a feed-forward neural network and what it
00:49:08 was interesting to see that clearly you know this was not the most effective way to proceed and you need to have much
00:49:15 more complex models that can induce the representation which can translate this graph into the embeddings and and do
00:49:21 these predictions so this is one direction and another direction which is kind of related is not only to stop by
00:49:29 looking at the embedding itself but actually modify it to produce better molecules so you can think about it as
00:49:36 the machine translation that you can start with a molecule and then there is an improved version of molecular and you
00:49:43 can again within coda translate it into the hidden space and then learn how to modify to improve the in some ways
00:49:50 version of the molecules so that's it's kind of really exciting we already seen that the property prediction works
00:49:56 pretty well and now we are generating molecules and there is actually loves which are manufacturing
00:50:05 this molecule so we'll see why it will get us okay that's really exciting that so there's a lot of promise
00:50:10 speaking of machine translation and embeddings I think you do you have done a lot of really great research in NLP
00:50:19 natural language processing can you tell me your journey through NLP what ideas problems approaches were you working on
00:50:27 were you fascinated with did you explore before this magic of deep learning re-emerged and after so when I started
00:50:37 for my working in LP it was the 97th this is very interesting time it was exactly the time that I came to ACL and
00:50:44 the time I could barely understand English but it was exactly like the transition point because half of the
00:50:52 papers where really you know rule-based approaches where people took more kind of heavy linguistic approaches for small
00:50:59 domains and try to build up from there and then they were the first generation of papers which were corpus based papers
00:51:06 and they were very simple in our terms when you collect some statistics and do prediction based on them and I found it
00:51:12 really fascinating that you know one community can think so very differently about you know about the problem and I
00:51:22 remember the first paper that I wrote it didn't have a single formula it didn't have evaluation it just had examples of
00:51:30 outputs and this was a standard of the field at a time in some ways I mean people maybe just started emphasizing
00:51:38 the empirical evaluation but for many applications like summarization your interest or some examples of outwards
00:51:44 and then increasingly you can see that how the statistical approach is dominated the field and we've seen you
00:51:53 know increased performance across many basic tasks the sad part of the story may be that if you look again through
00:52:03 this journey we see that the role of linguistics in some ways greatly diminishes and
00:52:11 I think that you really need to look through the whole proceeding to do to find Martin to papers which make some
00:52:17 interesting linguistic references it's really today today today this was different active trees just even
00:52:24 basically against our conversation about human understanding of language which I guess what linguistic this would be
00:52:32 structured parkour represent representing language in a way that's human explainable understandable is
00:52:41 missing know if it is what is explainable and understandable in the end you know we perform functions and
00:52:48 it's okay do you have machine which performs a function like when you're thinking about your calculator correct
00:52:55 your calculator can do calculation very different from you would do the calculation but it's very effective I
00:53:00 mean and this is fine if we can achieve certain tasks with high accuracy it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to
00:53:08 understand it the same way as we understand in some ways it's even the eve to request because you have so many
00:53:15 other sources of information that are absent when you are training your system so it's ok is it delivers it I never
00:53:22 tell you one application this is really fascinating in 97 when it came to ACL there was some papers on machine
00:53:27 translation they were like primitive like people were trying really really simple and the feeling my feeling wasn't
00:53:35 you know to make real machine translation system it's like to fly and the moon and build a house there in the
00:53:41 garden and live happily ever after I mean it's like impossible I never could imagine that within you know 10 years we
00:53:48 would already see the system working and now you know nobody is even surprised to utilize the system on daily basis so
00:53:55 this was like a huge huge progress saying that people for very long time try to solve using other mechanisms and
00:54:03 they were unable to solve it that's why coming back to a question about biology then you know in linguistics people try
00:54:12 to go this way and try to write the the syntactic trees and try to abstract it and to find the right representation and
00:54:21 you know they couldn't get very five with this understanding while these models using you know other sources
00:54:31 actually cable to make a lot of progress now I'm not naive to think but we are in this paradise space in NLP and shows you
00:54:40 know that when we slightly change the domain and when we decrease the amount of training it can do like really
00:54:45 bizarre and funny thing but I think it's just a matter of improving generalization capacity which is just a
00:54:52 technical question Wow so that's that's the question how much of language understanding can be solved with deep
00:55:00 neural networks in your intuition I mean it's unknown I suppose but as we start to creep towards romantic notions of the
00:55:10 spirit of the Turing test and conversation and dialogue and something that may be to to me or to us silly
00:55:20 humans feels like it needs real understanding how much can I be achieved with these neural networks or
00:55:29 statistical methods so I guess I am very much driven by the human by the outcomes can we achieve the performance which
00:55:38 will be satisfactory for for us for different tasks now if you again look at machine translation system which are you
00:55:45 know trained on large amounts of data they really can do a remarkable job relatively to where they've been a few
00:55:53 years ago and if you you know if you project into the future if it will be the same speed of improvement
00:56:00 you know this is great now does it bother me that it's not doing the same translation as we are doing now if you
00:56:07 go to cognitive science we still don't really understand what we are doing I mean there are a lot of theories so
00:56:13 there is obviously a lot of progress and standing but our understanding what exactly goes on you know in our brains
00:56:19 when we process language it's still not crystal clear and precise that we can translate it into machines
00:56:28 what does bother me is that you know again that machines can be extremely brittle when you go out of your comfort
00:56:34 zone of that when there is a distributional shift between training and testing and it have been years and
00:56:40 years every year when I teach NOP class you know show them some examples of translation from some newspaper in
00:56:47 Hebrew whatever it was perfect and then they have a recipe that to me a closed system sent me a while ago and it was
00:56:56 written in Finnish of Karelian pies and it's just a terrible translation you cannot understand anything what it does
00:57:03 it's not like some syntactic mistakes it's just terrible in year after year I try and interview translate in the end
00:57:08 after year it does it's terrible walk because I guess you know the recipe is a no big part of their training refers to
00:57:18 our so but in terms of outcomes that's a really clean good way to look at it I guess the question I was asking is do
00:57:27 you think the imagine of future do you think the current approaches can pass the Turing test in the way in the best
00:57:36 possible formulation of the Turing test is would you want to have a conversation within your own network for an hour
00:57:49 Oh God but there are some people in this world alive or not that you would like to talk to for an hour could in your
00:57:56 network of achieve that outcome so I think it would be really hard to create a successful training set we renamed
00:58:03 Valene together conversation for a contextual conversation for an hour it's a problem of data I think in some ways
00:58:10 it's informative it's a problem both of data and the problem of the way we are training our systems their ability to
00:58:18 truly to generalize to be very compositional in some ways it limited you know if in the current capacity at
00:58:28 least you know we can translate well we can you know find information well we can extract information so there are
00:58:34 many capacities and which is doing very well and you can ask me would you trust the machine to translate for you and use
00:58:40 it as a source I would say absolutely especially if we are talking about newspaper date or other data which is in
00:58:46 the rearm of its own training so I would say yes but you know having conversations with the machine it's not
00:58:56 something that I would choose to do but you know I would tell you something talking about Turing test and about all
00:59:02 this kind of eliezer conversations I remember visiting tents and in China and they have this chat board and they claim
00:59:09 it is like really humongous amount of the local population which like four hours talks to the child what to me it
00:59:15 was I cannot believe it but apparently it's like documented that there are some people who enjoy this conversation and
00:59:23 you know it brought to me the another MIT story about Eliza and wasting bomb I don't know if you familiar with the
00:59:30 store service in Bonn was a professor at MIT and when he developed this Eliza which was just doing string matching
00:59:38 very trivial like restating of what you said with very few rules no syntax apparently they were secretaries at MIT
00:59:46 that would sit for hours and converse with this trivial thing and at the time there was no beautiful interfaces so you
00:59:51 actually need to go through the pain of communicating and the wisdom bound himself was so horrified by this
00:59:57 phenomena that people can believe in after the machine you just need to give them the hint that machine understands
01:00:04 you and you can complete the rest that he kind of stopped this research and went into kind of trying to understand
01:00:10 what these artificial intelligence can do to our brains so my point is you know how much it's not how good is the
01:00:21 technology is how ready we are to believe that it delivers the goods that we are trying to get
01:00:27 that's a really beautiful way to put it I I by the way I'm not horrified by that possibility but inspired by it because I
01:00:36 mean human connection whether it's through language or through love it it seems like it's very amenable to machine
01:00:48 learning and the rest is just challenges of psychology thank you said the secretaries who enjoy spending hours I
01:00:53 would say I would describe most of our lives as enjoying spending hours with those we love for very silly reasons all
01:01:02 we're doing is keyword matching as well so I'm not sure how much intelligence we exhibit to each other you know with the
01:01:09 people we love that we're close with so it's a very interesting point of what it means to pass the Turing test
01:01:16 well language I think you're right in terms of conversation I think machine translation is it has
01:01:23 very clear performance and improvement right what it means to have a fulfilling conversation is very very person
01:01:32 dependent and context dependent and so on that's a yeah it's very well put so but in your view what's a benchmark a
01:01:42 natural language a test that's just out of reach right now but we might be able to that's exciting is it a machine isn't
01:01:49 perfecting machine translation or is there other is it summarization what's what's out there it goes across specific
01:01:57 application it's more about the ability to learn from few examples for real what we call future learning and all these
01:02:04 cases because you know the way we publish these papers today we say if we have like a naively we get 55 but now we
01:02:12 had a few example and we can move to 65 none of these methods actually realistically doing anything useful you
01:02:17 cannot use them today and their ability to be able to generalize and to move or to be
01:02:29 autonomous in finding the data that you need to learn to be able to perfect new tasks or new language this is an area
01:02:38 where I think we really need to to move forward to and we are not yet there are you at all excited curious by
01:02:47 the possibility of creating human level intelligence is this is you've been very in your discussion so if we're looking
01:02:56 at oncology you're trying to use machine learning to help the world in terms of alleviating suffering if you look at
01:03:02 natural language processing you focus on the outcomes of improving practical things like machine translation but you
01:03:09 know human level intelligence is the thing that our civilization is dreaming about creating superhuman level
01:03:17 intelligence do you think about this do you think it's at all within our reach so as you said to yourself for any I'm
01:03:25 talking about you know how do you perceive you know our communications with each other that you know we're
01:03:31 matching keywords and certain behaviors and so all so in the end whenever one assesses let's say relations with
01:03:40 another person you have a separate kind of measurements and outcomes inside you had the determine you know what is the
01:03:47 status of the relation so one way and this is classical dilemma what is the intelligence is it the fact that now we
01:03:52 are gonna do the same way as human is doing when we don't even understand what the human is doing or we now have an
01:03:59 ability to deliver this outcomes but not in one area not in a non fear not just to translate or just answer questions
01:04:05 but it was many many areas that we can achieve the functionality is that humans can achieve with the ability to learn
01:04:13 and do other things I think this is and this we can actually measure how far we are and that's what makes me excited
01:04:22 that we you know in my lifetime at least so far what we've seen it's like tremendous progress across with these
01:04:30 different functionalities and I think it will be really exciting to see where we will be and again one way to think about
01:04:40 is there are machines which are improving their functionality another one is to think about us with our brains
01:04:47 which I'm perfect how they can be accelerated by this technology as it becomes stronger and stronger
01:04:58 coming back to another book that I love flowers for algernon have you read this book yes so there is this point that
01:05:06 then the patient gets this miracle cure which changes his brain and of a sudden the he life in a different way and can
01:05:13 do certain things better but certain things much worse so you can imagine this kind of computer
01:05:23 augmented cognition where it can bring you that now in the same way as you know the cars enable us to get to places
01:05:30 where we've never been before can we think differently can we think faster so and we already see a lot of it happening
01:05:40 in how it impacts us but I think we have a long way to go there so that's sort of artificial intelligence and technology
01:05:48 affecting our augmenting our intelligence as humans yesterday a company called neural link announced
01:05:56 they do this whole demonstration I don't know if you saw it it's they demonstrated brain computer brain
01:06:03 machine interface whether it's like a sewing machine for the brain do you  you know a lot of that is quite out
01:06:12 there in terms of things that some people would say are impossible but there are dreamers and want to engineer
01:06:19 systems like that do you see based on what you just said I hope for that more direct interaction with the brain i I
01:06:27 think there are different ways one is a direct interaction with the brain and again there are lots of companies that
01:06:32 work in this space and I think there will be a lot of developments when I'm just saying that many times we are not
01:06:40 aware of our feelings of motivation what drives us like let me give you a trivial example our attention there are a lot of
01:06:47 studies in demonstrate that it takes a while to a person to understand that they are not attentive anymore and we
01:06:52 know that there are people who really have strong capacity to hold the tension there are another end of the spectrum
01:06:58 people with a DD and other issues they have problem to regulate their attention imagine to yourself do you have like a
01:07:04 cognitive aid this just alerts you based on your gaze that your attention is now not on what you are doing and it's sort
01:07:11 of writing a paper you're now dreaming of what you're going to do in the evening so even this kind of simple
01:07:17 measurement things how they can change us and I see it even in these simple ways with myself I have my zone up from
01:07:27 that I go to MIT gym it kind of records you know how much the Duran and you have points and you could get some status
01:07:35 whatever like what is this ridiculous thing who would ever care about some status in some up guess what so took it
01:07:41 to me to contain the status you have to do certain number of points every month and not only is that they do it every
01:07:50 single month for the last 18 months it went to the poem that I was running and the day I was injured and when I could
01:08:00 run again I in two days I did like some humongous amount of ready to complete the point I was like really not safe
01:08:10 music I'm not gonna lose my status so you can already see that this direct measurement and the feedback it's you
01:08:16 know we're looking at video games and see why you know the addiction aspect of it but you can imagine that the same
01:08:22 idea can be expanded to many other areas of our life when we really can get feedback and imagine in your case in
01:08:30 relations when we are doing keyword matching imagine that the person who is generating the keywords that first one
01:08:38 gets direct feedback before the whole thing explodes is it maybe a point we are going in the wrong direction
01:08:48 really behavior modifying moment so yeah it's a relationship management - so yeah that's that's a fascinating whole area
01:08:56 of psychology actually as well as seeing how our behavior has changed with basically all human relations now have
01:09:05 other non-human entities helping us out so you  you teach a large a huge machine learning course here at MIT I
01:09:15 can ask you a million questions but you've seen a lot of students what ideas do students struggle with the most as
01:09:23 they first enter this world of machine learning actually this year was the first time I started teaching a small
01:09:31 machine learning class and it came as a result of what I saw in my big machine learning class the to me Ackland I build
01:09:38 maybe six years ago what we've seen that as this area become more and more popular more and more
01:09:46 people at MIT want to take this class and while we designed it for computer science majors there were a lot of
01:09:52 people who really I interested to learn in but unfortunately their background was not enabling them to do well in the
01:10:00 class and many of them associated machine learning with the would struggle in failure primarily for non-majors
01:10:08 and that's why which restarts the new class which we call machine learning from algorithms to modeling which
01:10:16 emphasizes more the modeling aspects of it and focuses on it has majors and non-majors so we kind of try to extract
01:10:26 the relevant paths and make it more accessible because the fact that we're teaching 20 classifiers in standard
01:10:31 machine learning class it's really a big question we really needed but it was interesting to see this from first
01:10:38 generation of students you know when they came back from their internships and from their jobs what different and
01:10:47 exciting things they can do is it I would never think that you can even apply machine learning - some of them
01:10:53 are like matching you know their relations and you know that actually brings up an interesting point of
01:11:02 computer science in general it almost seems maybe I'm crazy but it almost seems like everybody needs to learn how
01:11:10 to program these days if you're 20 years old or if you're starting school even if you're an English major it seems it
01:11:19 seems like programming unlocks so much possibility in this world so in when you interact with those non majors is their
01:11:29 skills that they were simply lacking at the time that you wish they had and that they learned in high school and so on
01:11:36 like how will it how should education change in this computer computerized the world that we live in
01:11:42 seen because they knew that is a Python component in the class you know their Python skills we're okay and the class
01:11:49 is not really heavy on programming they were primarily kind of add parts to the programs I think it was more of them mathematical
01:11:56 barriers and the class against with the design on the majors was using the notation like Big O for complexity and
01:12:03 others if people who come from different backgrounds just don't have it in the lexicon it's unnecessarily
01:12:10 very challenging notion but they were just not aware so I think that you know kind of linear algebra and probability
01:12:18 the basics that calculus won't variate calculus a thing that can help what advice would you give the students
01:12:24 interested in machine learning interested you've talked about detecting curing cancer drug design if they want
01:12:33 to get into that field what what should they do get into it and succeed as researchers and entrepreneurs the first
01:12:45 good piece of news is right now there are lots of resources that you know are created at different levels and you can
01:12:55 find online on school classes which are more mathematical more applied and so on so you can find kind of a preacher which
01:13:03 preaches your own language where you can enter the field and you can make many different types of contribution
01:13:08 depending of you know what is your strengths and the second point I think it's really important to find some area
01:13:17 which you which you really care about and it can motivate your learning and it can be for somebody curing cancer or
01:13:25 doing self-driving cars so whatever but to find an area where you know there is data where you believe there are strong
01:13:32 patterns and we should be doing it and we're still not doing it oh you can do it better and just start there and see
01:13:42 where it can bring you so you've you've been very successful in many directions in life but you also mentioned flowers
01:13:53 and I think I've read or listened to you mention somewhere that researchers often get lost in the details of their work
01:13:59 this is per our original discussion with cancer and so on and don't look at the bigger picture bigger questions of
01:14:06 meaning and so on so let me ask you the impossible question of what's the meaning of this thing of life of your
01:14:18 life of research why do you think we descendant of great apes are here on this spinning ball you know I don't
01:14:29 think that I have really a global answer you know maybe that's why I didn't go to humanities and then thank University's
01:14:41 Colossus in undergrad but the way I'm thinking about it that each one of us inside of them have their own set of you
01:14:49 know things that we believe I important and it just happens that we are busy with achieving various goal of busy
01:14:57 listening to others and to kind of try to conform and to be part of the crowd that we don't listen to that part
01:15:08 and you know yeah we all should find some time to understand what is our own individual missions and we may have very
01:15:15 different missions and to make sure that while we are running ten thousand things we are not you know missing out and
01:15:24 we're putting all the resources to satisfy our own mission and if I look over my time when I was younger most of
01:15:36 these missions you know I was primarily driven by the external stimulus you know to achieve there so to be that and now a
01:15:47 lot of what I do is driven by really thinking what is important for me to achieve independently of the external
01:15:58 recognition and you know I don't mind to be viewed in certain ways the most important thing for me is to be true to
01:16:07 myself to what I think is right how long did it take how hard was it to find the user you have to be true to so it takes
01:16:17 time and even now sometimes you know the vanity and the triviality can take a MIG yeah it can everywhere it you know it's
01:16:26 just the vanity item it is different the vanity in different places but we all have our piece of vanity but I think
01:16:38 actually for me the many times the place to get back to it is you know when I when I'm alone and also when I read and
01:16:47 I think by selecting the right books you can get the right questions and learn from what you read
01:16:58 so but but again it's not perfect like vanities - dominates well that's a beautiful way to end thank you so much
