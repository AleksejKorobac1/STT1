00:00:17 13.8 billion years ago the universe was born and within a second of its existence there was gravity particles mass and
00:00:26 space today is incomparably larger and more voluminous as superclusters of galaxies lie in the dark metallic
00:00:32 filaments across distances so vast that even the fastest thing within that space takes millions of years to travel
00:00:38 meaningful distances as we learn more about how we think the universe began we are beginning to look towards the end
00:00:44 how will it become devoid of life stars galaxies or even cease to exist entirely no one could say for sure what the
00:00:51 ultimate fate of the universe will be but with advancements in technology we are beginning to better understand the
00:00:56 metrics and energies that will be instrumental in the end of everything and the likely possibilities are as
00:01:02 unsettling as they are fascinating in order to predict the distant future of the universe we must consider three
00:01:16 things the expansion of space-time the motions of galaxies around us and lastly the cause of these behaviors the first
00:01:23 thing to consider is the way that the universe around us is actually expanding it's easy to think of the universe as
00:01:29 this magnificent cosmic crystal bull expanding outwards of the speed of light but this is far from the truth
00:01:37 when space expands new space is created everywhere equally all points in space-time expand at the same rate from
00:01:43 the space between you and your computer to the farthest reaches of the oldest galaxies the more space expands the more
00:01:49 space there is that can expand and so the process accelerates with time think of it like a balloon inflating but we
00:01:56 are on the outside not the inside no matter where we stand on the surface the surface area always increases at the
00:02:02 same rate and as such the center is everywhere this expansion is very weak and so gravity can hold objects that are
00:02:08 gravitationally bound together like you me earth the rest of the galaxy and our local galactic group however at
00:02:15 intergalactic distances beyond the local group objects are receding away from us and we see evidence of this through
00:02:22 redshift the process of the universe's expansion elongating visible light turning it red this recession means that
00:02:29 the larger the present-day universe becomes the larger the distance has become between us and other pockets of
00:02:35 the universe the expansion rate is currently estimated to be about 68 kilometers per second per megaparsec
00:02:41 this means that right here space is expanding in all directions at that rate but the further out you go the faster
00:02:47 objects are being pushed away from us a mega parsec is a unit of measurement equivalent to about 3.3 million light
00:02:55 years so about 6 mega parsecs or just under 20 million light years away the space between us and those galaxies is
00:03:01 growing at a rate of over 400 kilometers per second the intergalactic distances between us and galaxies like Messier 87
00:03:09 I see one one zero one and gnz at 11 is growing all the time this also means that at a sufficiently distant point
00:03:15 galaxies will be moving away from us faster than light speed this doesn't break any laws of physics as they
00:03:21 themselves are not moving that fast but the distance between us and there is growing more than light can travel in
00:03:28 the same increment of time this means that there is a point relative to us beyond which light will never reach us
00:03:34 the cosmic event horizon the boundary that separates our observable universe from the rest of the universe which we
00:03:40 will never be able to see or detect once galaxies cross this point they become causally disconnected and will have a
00:03:45 little hope there may have been of Transportation and communication and eventually even observation of any kind
00:03:52 will be gone these galaxies will be lost and we will never see them again and the worst part over 95% of the galaxies in
00:03:59 the observable universe have already crossed this point of no return for travel and communication for us all
00:04:05 because of the aggressive nature of the universe's expansion but what is causing this kind of expansion well we don't
00:04:12 know the underlying mechanisms behind it but we call it dark energy don't let this name fool you
00:04:18 dark energy is simply our term for the giant IOU to future scientists that we currently attribute to the accelerated
00:04:25 expansion of the universe we don't know how or why it works but leading theories have suggested everything from a
00:04:30 naturally occurring byproduct of space to a new type of energy field to random fluctuations at the lowest level of
00:04:38 interaction what we do know however is that it is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe
00:04:44 normal matter and energy cannot make the universe behave in this way and as the density of matter Falls the density of
00:04:49 dark energy appears to remain consistent because more of it pops into existence with the increasing volume of space
00:04:56 light travels along this ever expanding space and it's wavelengths become increasingly red shifted and this is
00:05:02 exactly how we discovered dark energy when in 1998 the high Zed supernova search team analyzed distant supernovae
00:05:08 and discovered that the universe was not only expanding but it appeared to be getting faster it appeared to have
00:05:14 expanded more in the latter half of its life when dark energy took over the universe entered a new era the dark
00:05:22 energy dominated era marking the point at which matter domination ended around nine point eight billion years after the
00:05:28 Big Bang a day which would prove to be a tipping point for the universe with these three things considered we
00:05:35 can start to get a better idea of how the next few trillion years will play out in several billion years the Milky
00:05:40 Way and Andromeda galaxies will collide emerge and eventually dozens of smaller dwarf galaxies in the local group will
00:05:46 also be drawn to this new giant starburst galaxy with the unpopular name milk dromeda everything else beyond our
00:05:53 local group pocket was flung beyond our reach in the earliest nanoseconds of time and so gravity cannot counteract it
00:06:00 as it recedes away from us as the amount of dark energy continues to elongate and expand the universe even the nearest
00:06:06 galaxies to us we'll cross the cosmic horizon and within a hundred and fifty billion years everything beyond our
00:06:12 local supercluster will be invisible and undetectable this curtain of darkness will continue to swallow everything
00:06:19 beyond the boundaries of our galaxy and eventually it will become impossible to tell that anything exists beyond the
00:06:25 edges of milk dromeda nothing intelligent that emerges in this post intergalactic era will ever be able to
00:06:30 know what lies beyond the apparent end of their galaxy and this will be the same right across the universe
00:06:37 furthermore this expansion and recession of the observable universe has as many practical problems as it does
00:06:42 existential nightmares with all galaxies flung beyond the reach of each other new galaxies will not be able to form and
00:06:48 the current galaxies of the universe will start to die out new stars will be unable to form as well and the existing
00:06:54 ones will either collapse - white dwarves or go supernova gradually the great fires of the universe will be
00:07:02 extinguished one by one as the galaxies they formed it and become unbound and then 100 trillion years in the future
00:07:08 the final long living red and white dwarfs will burn out the last of their fuel and fade into black dwarfs and the
00:07:15 universe will know its second Dark Age only this dark age will likely last for an eternity
00:07:21 and before long one of the universe's primordial signatures will be the last thing to go out the photons at the CMB
00:07:28 will fade further and eventually become undetectable the afterglow of the Big even at this point the universe can
00:07:39 still be considered young only the supermassive black holes of the universe seeded perhaps by the primordial black
00:07:44 holes which emerged when the universe was only one second old will survive and at ten to the power of 40 years they
00:07:51 will have consumed the last of the matter and will single-handedly dominate the dark cold universe this rain will
00:07:58 last an unbelievably long time but it is not eternal these black holes will eventually evaporate due to Hawking
00:08:04 radiation and perhaps as far as ten to the power of a hundred years in the future these black holes will finally
00:08:10 fizzle out of existence and the universe will be a dark cold sparse void trillions upon trillions of mega parsecs
00:08:18 in diameter it will then be powerless to its ultimate fate exactly what that will be well scientists have narrowed it down
00:08:34 to four possible options what caused the Big Bang it seems a bit unbelievable that something especially something like
00:08:41 the universe came from nothing what makes more sense or more sense to us at least is that something came before and
00:08:48 as general relativity developed in the 1900s a somewhat optimistic hypothesis for the fate of the universe was
00:08:55 described the universe is full of matter whose properties are determined by mass and whose interactions are dominated by
00:09:02 gravity more mass means more gravity which will pull everything together currently we believe that the density of
00:09:09 dark energy will remain constant as matters density Falls but if there's more matter than we currently predict or
00:09:15 less dark energy then eventually this will cause the universe's expansion to slow down and ultimately stop and it
00:09:21 will then begin contracting as the gravity of the objects within pulls it back in on itself
00:09:27 if this theory is correct then within a few trillion years causally disconnected galaxies would be flung back within our
00:09:34 reach causing galaxy mergers all over the place resulting in the births of millions of new galaxies instead of them
00:09:41 all dying out in secluded pockets however this contraction is unsustainable because as the volume of
00:09:47 the universe shrinks the density and temperature within Rises eventually stars and planets will be fried from the
00:09:53 outside as the universe is transformed and even atoms will break apart into unbound elementary particles in fact all
00:10:01 that will be able to survive are the black holes of the universe and these will gradually merge into larger and
00:10:06 larger black holes as they are brought within range of each other by the ever shrinking universe in the final moments
00:10:13 of cosmic time these black holes will unite and merge into one gigantic ultra massive black hole trillions of times
00:10:19 more massive than anything we can currently observe and it will contain the entire universes information finally
00:10:25 this black hole will consume all of space-time devouring itself in the process and return the universe to that
00:10:33 which it came from an infinitesimally small and dense singularity some people even take this a step further as opposed
00:10:40 that we live in an oscillatory universe and that the contraction back into a singularity will ultimately trigger a
00:10:45 similar chain of events to those of the Big Bang and a new universe would emerge and rapidly expand forming new space
00:10:52 with similar attributes in a cyclic or fashion some believe that this has been happening forever
00:10:58 and will continue to happen infinitum crazy right during the 1900s the Big Crunch and Big
00:11:05 Bounce were front running theories and we're even making puzzling discoveries indicating some sort of past universe to
00:11:12 support this at least six months ago as of the making of this video did the bicep2 radio telescope of the
00:11:18 bicep and Keck a rally pick up what has been described as apparent evidence for Hawking points remnants of supermassive
00:11:24 black holes which evaporated in a previous universe but whose imprints carried over into the next one these
00:11:31 points represent anomalous areas of the Cosmic Microwave Background which appeared to be sources of vast amounts
00:11:38 of energy and so while models which rely on the universe contracting have been challenged by recent dark energy
00:11:43 theories the question of whether the universe is oscillatory is still very in 1998 we discovered that the universe
00:11:55 was not only expanding but they expansion was accelerating and as such the Big Crunch now has some major doubts
00:12:02 over it as it is believed that gravity will not be able to counteract the endless expansion by dark energy we
00:12:07 still don't understand how dark energy works but what we do know is that it is almost certainly bad news and there's
00:12:15 another pretty big problem we know the universe began as unimaginable heat and energy and it's called ever since down
00:12:21 below the different thresholds for symmetry breaking nucleosynthesis and chemistry to occur and it's still
00:12:27 calling today but with a little help from dark energy it is on course to meet an irreversible temperature minimum the
00:12:34 end of all heat in the universe also known as the heat death or big freeze as the name suggests it refers to the end
00:12:42 of all differences in heat in the universe he is a product of energy matter in the universe needs some kind
00:12:49 of energy either directly or indirectly for things to happen and every process that performs work and uses energy gives
00:12:57 off waste heat these processes proceed in a way which reduces the availability of the remaining energy during the
00:13:03 energy transfer energy flows from a concentrated form which can be used to a dispersed form which is useless if new
00:13:11 energy cannot be created then the share of the universe's energy which is wasted aka its entropy will continue to
00:13:19 increase in the far future after the final black holes have evaporated all energy in the universe will be in this
00:13:25 dispersed State entropy will be at maximum and there won't be any temperature energy gradient to allow
00:13:31 information processing simply put nothing will ever be able to happen again matter will gradually break apart
00:13:38 into radiation over a long time and the entire universe will consist of a light cloud of photons and even this will
00:13:45 decay with time it's like ice melting into a glass of water the loss of all gradian the big freeze will bring the
00:13:52 universe to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero at which point it will be a homogeneous sparse skeleton
00:13:59 dark energy will expand this dead unrecognizable universe to indescribable sizes and
00:14:05 then perhaps it will just linger there for an eternity perhaps there exist ancient universities
00:14:10 which have already undergone he deaths perhaps dark energy will curse the universe so that its second Dark Age
00:14:17 lasts forever or perhaps it will destroy we are just becoming aware of dark Energy's role in the fate of the
00:14:29 universe but there's still a long way to go the discovery of accelerating expansion of the universe is not a good
00:14:35 thing but the real situation could be even worse we currently think that dark energy remains constant throughout space
00:14:42 but another possibility is that it works inversely to the normal energy fields and its density is in fact increasing
00:14:49 the current density of dark energy is very low but if this increases over time then there's going to come a day where
00:14:54 it becomes denser than the structures of the cosmos such as star as galaxies and planets in this scenario gravity will no
00:15:02 longer be able to hold the structure together and the object will be torn apart right down to its atoms this means
00:15:09 that at some point in the future dark energy will exceed a density at which galaxies start becoming unbounded
00:15:15 unstable before long for planetary systems of these stars will become scattered and then the density of dark
00:15:21 energy would exceed that of planets and every star planet and Moon is pulled apart down to an atomic level and then
00:15:28 down to unbound elementary particles and the expanding universe would be so voluminous that no elementary particle
00:15:35 would ever encounter another one the universe will be completely ripped down to its finest pixels as some speculated
00:15:41 that even space-time itself would tear and would cease to exist dark energy is not our friend be it the big fries or a
00:15:49 big rip it means that the universe is unsustainable to life hate and maybe so far we've only focused on the fate of
00:16:05 the universe occurring everywhere but it's possible that somewhere a random anomaly has caused a chain of events to
00:16:10 take place right now which is amazing the universe like a cancer as opposed to a delete button this is all thanks to a
00:16:18 theoretical chain reaction called vacuum decay everything in the universe wants to reach is vacuum State aka a steady
00:16:25 state with as little energy as possible the same principle applies to the quantum fields which govern our universe
00:16:32 the same fields which determine the laws for particle interaction they want to reach their vacuum state - as far as we
00:16:39 know all of these fields reach their vacuum state in the universe long ago apart from one the Higgs field which
00:16:45 happens to be the field that gives particles their mass in 2012 scientists at CERN used the Large Hadron Collider
00:16:54 to identify what we think might be the long-sought Higgs boson but when we estimated its mass we discovered
00:17:00 something unsettling the Higgs field appears stable when it actually isn't it may be in a state of false vacuum it
00:17:08 appears stable because it is at a local minimum of energy but it still has hidden potential energy left to give
00:17:14 which puts it in a highly per carrier state think of it like standing on the edge of a cliff the universe may have to
00:17:24 be in this knife-edge state for stuff to happen like the formations of stars and galaxies but it also means that this
00:17:30 balance could be and inevitably will be disturbed with disastrous consequences for its surroundings if a quantum effect
00:17:38 such as quantum tunneling led to a disturbance in the balance of the Higgs field and a lower energy state is
00:17:43 possible than this hidden potential energy will be released as the area reaches a less energetic state and the
00:17:49 resulting effect on space-time is like throwing a match into a lake filled with petrol this point of disturbance would
00:17:55 create a brand new universe within hours a so-called true vacuum this spherical vacuum would expand outwards at the
00:18:03 speed of light as it releases this huge amount of potential energy completely destroying everything it engulfs and
00:18:09 leaving everything within its bounds shredded down to his elementary particles within this new vacuum universe
00:18:15 the laws of physics would be overwritten completely changing the properties of elementary particles and the way they
00:18:21 interact chemistry and information processing would be impossible and no atoms or molecules can form in such an
00:18:28 environment the scary thing about these theoretical bubbles is that they could be anywhere and could start at any time
00:18:35 there may be bubbles of true vacuum out there right now which are devouring their surroundings but are too distant
00:18:41 to ever bother us even if one did engulf us we'd never see it coming they expand almost like speed and
00:18:46 there's no stopping them either way everything would just be erased and unbound down to elementary particles and
00:18:54 a kind of cosmic fan off snap there's no telling how much of the universe if any is in true vacuum state but if the share
00:19:00 is high enough then the majority of the universe will have undergone this big change into a tree vacuum state and this
00:19:06 may have a profound effect on the way dark energy expands space-time maybe even inducing the opposite effect
00:19:14 dark energy will begin pulling the vacuum universe back in on itself which may ultimately lead this event to some
00:19:20 variation of the Big Crunch hypothesis it's unlikely but these vacuum bubbles are possible and perhaps even
00:19:26 statistically likely to be occurring somewhere in the vast expanse of space luckily however because most of the
00:19:32 space in the universe is causally disconnected from us as long as a bubble never begins inside the local group we
00:19:39 will never be affected by other true vacuums one of the few advantages of being confined into this dark lonely
00:20:09 the big crunch the big fries the big rip the big change these the four ways in which our universe could meet its destiny
00:20:18 in reality the heat death will likely be the winner the Big Crunch has been all but ruled out in its current form due to
00:20:25 the discovery of dark energy but perhaps some variant of the process will give the universe a second chance to see
00:20:31 another age or even a new universe entirely our quest to know the truth comes from our desire to find our place
00:20:39 in all of it will life exist after the universe does it already exists beyond it these are the questions that we want
00:20:45 to know but Humanity has far more pressing concerns to address before the heat death in little over 6,000 years
00:20:52 we've learned a staggering amount about the nature of our universe and our existence imagine what we could uncover
00:20:58 and learn if we gave ourselves a better chance of long-term survival as a species if the human race prevails for
00:21:06 thousands or even millions of years we might be able to observe the mechanisms that will determine our universe's
00:21:11 ultimate fate with our own eyes rather than lying solely on our predictions and equations until that time however we know
