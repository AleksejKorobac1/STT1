00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Leonard Susskind he's a professor of theoretical physics at Stanford
00:00:07 University and founding director of Stanford Institute of theoretical physics he's widely regarded as one of
00:00:14 the fathers of string theory and in general is one of the greatest physicists of our time both as a
00:00:21 researcher and an educator this is the artificial intelligence podcast perhaps you noticed that the people have been
00:00:26 speaking with are not just computer scientists but philosophers mathematicians writers psychologists
00:00:34 physicists and soon other disciplines to me AI is much bigger than deep learning bigger than computing it is our
00:00:41 civilizations journey into understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in the machine if you enjoy the podcast

00:00:55 friedman spelled fri d ma a.m. and now here's my conversation with leonard susskind
00:01:04 you work two more friends with richard fineman house he influenced you changed you as a physicist and thinker what I
00:01:14 saw I think what I saw was somebody who could do physics in this deeply intuitive way his style was almost a
00:01:22 closed his eyes and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about and I'll flank the mathematical highly
00:01:33 mathematical and very very sophisticated technical arguments that people would use I think that was also natural to me
00:01:42 but I saw somebody who was actually successful at it who could do physics in a way that that
00:01:53 I regarded as simpler more direct more intuitive and while I don't think he changed my way of thinking I do think he
00:02:02 validated it he made me look at it and say yeah that's something you can do and get away with practically even get away
00:02:08 with it so do you find yourself whether you're thinking about quantum mechanics or
00:02:16 black holes or string theory using intuition as a first step or step throughout using visualization yeah very
00:02:26 much so very much so I tend not to think about the equations I tend not to think about the symbols I tend to try to
00:02:34 visualize the phenomena themselves and then when I get an insight that I think is valid I might try to convert it to
00:02:42 mathematics but I'm not a math and then a natural mathematician or I'm good enough at it I'm good enough at it but
00:02:50 I'm not a great mathematician so for me the way of thinking about physics is first intuitive first visualization
00:03:00 scribble a few equations maybe but then try to convert it to mathematics experiences that other people are better
00:03:07 at converting into mathematics and I am and yet you've worked very counterintuitive ideas so how that's
00:03:14 true that's naive is something Connor into every their rewiring your brain in new ways yeah
00:03:22 quantum mechanics is not intuitive very little of modern physics is intuitive intuitive or what does intuitive mean it
00:03:31 means the ability to think about it with basic classical physics the physics that that we evolved with throwing stones
00:03:42 splashing water or whatever it happens to be quantum physics general relativity quantum field theory are deeply
00:03:52 unintuitive in that way but you know after time and getting familiar with these things you develop new intuitions
00:04:01 I always said you rewire and it's to the point where me and many of my friends find many my friends
00:04:09 can think more easily quantum-mechanically than we can classically we've gotten so used to it I
00:04:16 mean yes our neural wiring in our brain is such that we understand rocks and stones and water and so I'm sort of
00:04:23 evolved evolved for you do you think it's possible to create a wiring of neuron like state devices that more
00:04:33 naturally understand quantum mechanics understand wave function understand these weird things well I'm not sure I
00:04:41 think many of us have evolved the ability to think quantum mechanically to some extent but that doesn't mean you
00:04:50 can think like an electron that doesn't mean an another example forget for a minute quantum mechanics
00:04:58 just visualizing four dimensional space or five dimensional space or six dimensional space I think we're
00:05:06 fundamentally wired to visualize three dimensions I can't even visualize two dimensions or one dimension without thinking about it
00:05:15 as embedded in three dimension in space if I want to visualize a line I think of the line as being aligned in three
00:05:23 dimensions right well I think of the line as being aligned on a piece of paper with a piece of paper being in
00:05:29 three dimensions I never seem to be able to in some abstract and pure way visualize in my head the one dimension
00:05:37 the two dimension the four dimensions the five dimensions and I don't think that's ever gonna happen the reason is I
00:05:44 think our neural wiring is just set up for that on the other hand we do learn ways to think about five six seven
00:05:54 dimensions and we learn ways we learn mathematical ways and we learn ways to visualize them but they're different and
00:06:04 so yeah I think I think we do rewire ourselves whether we can ever completely rewire ourselves to be completely
00:06:10 comfortable with these concepts I doubt so that it's completely natural there was a tour it's completely natural so
00:06:17 I'm sure there's some what you could argue creatures that live in it two-dimensional space yeah and there are
00:06:27 and well it's romanticizing the notion of course we're all living as far as we know in three-dimensional space
00:06:33 but how do you how do those creatures imagine 3d space well probably the way we imagined 4d by using some mathematics
00:06:43 and some equations and some some tricks okay so jumping back to a fireman just for a second he had a little bit of an
00:06:54 ego yes what do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science I think both both
00:07:03 both I think you have to have both arrogance and humility you have to have the arrogance to say I can do this
00:07:12 nature is difficult nature is very very hard I'm smart enough I can do it I can win the battle with nature on the other
00:07:21 hand I think you also have to have the humility to know that you're very likely to be wrong on any given occasion
00:07:30 everything you're thinking could suddenly change young people can come along and say things you won't
00:07:37 understand and you'll be lost and flabbergasted so I think it's a combination of both you better recognize
00:07:47 that you're very limited and you better be able to say to yourself I'm not so limited that I can't win this battle
00:07:55 with nature it takes a special kind of person who can manage both of those I would say and I
00:08:02 would say there's echoes of that in your own work a little bit of ego a little bit of outside of the box humble
00:08:08 thinking I hope so so it was their time where you complete you felt you looked at yourself and
00:08:19 asked am i completely wrong about this oh yeah but the whole thing about specific things the whole thing that way
00:08:28 which cold thing me and me and my ability to do this thing oh those kinds of doubts those first of
00:08:33 all did you have those kinds of doubts no I had different kind of doubts I came from a very working-class background and
00:08:40 I was uncomfortable in academia for Oh for a long time but they weren't doubts about my ability of my they were just
00:08:51 the discomfort and being in an environment that my family hadn't participated in I know nothing about as
00:08:59 a young person I didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics until I was almost 20 years old so I did have
00:09:10 certain kind of doubts but not about my ability I don't think I was too worried about whether I would succeed or not I
00:09:20 never I never felt this insecurity am I ever gonna get a job that veteran never occurred to me that I wouldn't maybe you
00:09:29 could speak a little bit to this sense of what is academia for because I do feel a bit uncomfortable in it mm-hm
00:09:39 there's something I can't put quite into words what you have that's not doesn't if we call it music
00:09:46 you play a different kind of music than a lot of academia what how have you joined this Orchestra how do you think
00:09:53 about it I don't know that I thought about it as much as I just felt it yeah you know
00:10:01 thinking is one thing feeling is another thing I felt like an outsider until a certain age when I suddenly found myself
00:10:12 the ultimate insider in academic physics and that was a sharp transition in the world I wasn't the young man I was
00:10:22 probably 50 years old you were never quite it was a phase transition you were never quite free milk in the middle yeah
00:10:30 that's right I wasn't I always felt a little bit of an outsider the beginning my way of thinking was different
00:10:42 my approach to mathematics was different but also this my social background that I came from was different now these days
00:10:51 half the young people I meet their parents were professors my that was not my case so yeah but then all of a sudden
00:11:03 at some point I found myself at they're very much the center of maybe not the only one at the center but certainly one
00:11:10 of the people in the center of a certain kind of physics and all that put away I mean I went away in a flash so maybe
00:11:22 maybe a little bit with Fineman but in general how do you develop ideas do you work their ideas alone do you brainstorm
00:11:29 with others oh both both very definitely both the earth the younger time I spent more time with myself now because I'm at
00:11:44 Stanford because I'm because I have a lot of ex students and I you know people who who are interested in the same thing
00:11:54 I am I spend a good deal of time almost on a daily basis interacting brainstorming as you said it's a it's a
00:12:03 very important part I spend less time the paper and just sitting there staring at it
00:12:15 what are your hopes for quantum computers so machines that are based on that have some elements of leverage
00:12:25 quantum mechanical ideas yeah it's not just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas you can simulate quantum systems on a
00:12:34 classical computer simulate them means solve the Schrodinger equation for them or solve the equations of quantum
00:12:42 mechanics on a computer on a classical computer but the classical computer is not doing is not a quantum mechanical
00:12:50 system itself of course it is that everything is made of quantum mechanics but it's not some functioning it's not a
00:12:55 functioning as a quantum system it's just solving equations the quantum computer is truly a quantum system which
00:13:05 is actually doing the things that you're programming it to do you want to program a quantum field theory if you do it in
00:13:15 classical physics that program is not actually functioning in the computer as a quantum field theory it's just solving
00:13:22 some equations physically it's not doing the things that that the quantum system would do the quantum computer is really
00:13:30 a quantum mechanical system which is actually carrying out the quantum operations you can measure it at the end
00:13:38 it intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle it is limited in the same way that quantum systems are
00:13:46 limited by uncertainty and so forth and it really is a quantum system that means that what you what you're doing when you
00:13:53 program something for quantum system is they're actually building a real version of the system the limits of a classical
00:14:01 computer classical computers are enormous ly limited when it comes to the quantum systems enormously limited
00:14:11 because you probably heard this before but in order to store the amount of information that's in a quantum state of
00:14:22 400 spins that's not very many 400 I can put in my path with 400 pennies in my pocket so we'll
00:14:32 be able to simulate the quantum state of 400 elementary quantum systems qubits we call him to do that would take more
00:14:41 information than can possibly be stored in the entire universe if it were packed so tightly that you couldn't pack
00:14:52 anymore in right 400 cubits on the other hand if your quantum computer is composed of four hundred qubits it can
00:14:58 do everything four hundred qubits can do what kind of space if you just intuitively think about the space of
00:15:06 algorithms that that unlocks for us so there's a whole complexity theory around classical computers measuring the
00:15:14 running time of things and PE so on what kind of algorithm is just intuitively do you think it's you know mocks for us
00:15:21 okay so we know that there are a handful of algorithms that can seriously be quantum of classical computers and which
00:15:28 can have exponentially more power and this is a mathematical statement nobody's exhibited this in the
00:15:33 laboratory it's a mathematical statement we know that's true but it also seems more and more that the number of such
00:15:41 things is very limited only very very special problems exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer others
00:15:53 of standard problems to my mind as far as I can tell the great power of quantum computers will actually be to simulate
00:16:00 quantum systems if you're interested in a certain quantum system and it's too hard to simulate classically you simply
00:16:09 build a version of the same system you build a version of it you build a model of it that's actually functioning as the
00:16:16 system you run it and then you do the same thing you would do the quantum system you make measurements on it
00:16:22 quantum measurements on it the advantages you can run it much slower you could say why bother why not just
00:16:30 use the real system and why not just do experiments on the real system well real systems are kind of limited you can't
00:16:35 change them you can't like them you can't slow them down so that you can poke into them you can't
00:16:43 modify them an arbitrary kinds of ways to see what would happen if I if I change the system a little bit so I
00:16:53 think that quantum computers will be extremely valuable in in understanding quantum systems at the
00:17:04 lowest of the fundamental laws they're actually satisfying the same laws as the systems that they're simulating that's
00:17:11 right okay so in the one hand you have things like factoring in factoring is the great thing of quantum computers
00:17:20 factoring large numbers that doesn't seem that much to do with quantum mechanics right it seems to be almost a
00:17:29 fluke that a quantum computer can solve the factoring problem in a short time so though and those problems seem to be
00:17:39 extremely special rare and it's not clear to me that there's gonna be a lot of them on the other hand there are a
00:17:46 lot of quantum systems chemistry there's solid-state physics there's material science there's quantum gravity there's
00:17:52 all kinds of quantum of quantum field theory and some of these are actually turning out to be Applied Sciences as
00:18:02 well as very fundamental Sciences so we probably will run out of the ability to solve equations for these things you
00:18:09 know solve equations by the standard methods of pencil and paper and solve the equations by the method of classical
00:18:17 computers and so what we'll do is we'll build versions of these systems run them and run them under controlled
00:18:25 circumstances or we can change them manipulate them make measurements on them and find out all the things we want
00:18:29 to know so in finding out the things we want to know about very small systems right now
00:18:39 the is there something we can also find out about the macro level about something about it the function and
00:18:47 forgive me of our brain biological systems the the stuff that's about one meter in size versus much much smaller
00:18:55 well what the only excitement is about among the people that I interact with is understanding black holes that falls
00:19:02 black holes are big things there are many many degrees of freedom there is another kind of quantum system that is
00:19:10 big it's a large quantum computer and one of the things we learned is that the physics of large
00:19:16 quantum computers is in some ways similar to the physics of large quantum black holes and we're using that
00:19:23 relationship now you asked you didn't ask about quantum computers or systems you didn't ask about black holes you
00:19:29 asked about brains yeah I bought stuff that's in the middle of the - it's different so but black
00:19:37 holes are there's something fundamental about black holes it feels to be very different in the brain yes and they also
00:19:45 function in a very quantum mechanical way right okay it is first of all unclear to me but of course it's unclear
00:19:53 to me I another I'm not a a neuroscientist I have I don't even have very many friends who are
00:20:00 neuroscientists I would like to have more friends who are neuroscientists I just don't run into them very often
00:20:07 among the few neuroscientists I've ever talked about about this they are pretty convinced that the brain functions
00:20:18 classically there is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system or doesn't make use of the of the special features
00:20:26 entanglement coherent superposition are they right I don't know I sort of hope that wrong
00:20:32 with just because I like the romantic idea that the brain is a quantum system and but I think that I think probably not
00:20:41 the other thing big systems can be composed of lots of little systems materials the materials are that we work
00:20:50 with and so forth are three large systems and a large piece of material but they're Bagan they're made out of
00:20:56 quantum systems now one of the things that's been happening over the last a good number of years is with discovering
00:21:04 materials and quantum systems which function much more quantum mechanically then than we imagine topological
00:21:12 insulators this kind of thing that kind of thing those are macroscopic systems but they just superconductors
00:21:20 superconductors I have a lot of quantum mechanics in them you can have a large chunk of superconductor so it's a big
00:21:27 decent material on the other hand it's functioning and its properties depend very very strongly on quantum mechanics
00:21:35 and to analyze them you need the tools of quantum mechanics if we can go on to black holes mm-hmm and looking at the
00:21:44 universe as a information processing system as a computer as a giant computer what's the power of thinking of the
00:21:51 universe as an information processing system but what is perhaps its use besides the mathematical use of
00:22:00 discussing black holes and your famous debates and ideas around that to human beings or life in general as information
00:22:09 processing systems well all systems are information processing systems you poke them they change a little bit
00:22:17 they evolve all systems or information processes there's no extra magic to us humans it certainly feels consciousness
00:22:26 intelligence feels like magic sure though where does it emerge from if we look at information processing what
00:22:36 are the emergent phenomena that come from viewing the world is an information processing system here is what I think
00:22:43 my thoughts are not worth much of this if you ask me about physics my thoughts may be worth something
00:22:48 yes if you ask me about this I'm not sure my thoughts are worth anything but as I said earlier I think when we do
00:22:56 introspection when we imagine doing introspection and try to figure out what it is when we do and we're thinking I
00:23:03 think we I think we get it wrong I'm pretty sure we get it wrong everything I've heard about the way the brain
00:23:09 functions is so counterintuitive for example you have neurons which detect the vertical lines you have different
00:23:17 neurons which detect lines at 45 degrees you have different neurons I never imagined that there were whole circuits
00:23:23 which were devoted to vertical lines in the brain yeah doesn't seem to we where when my brain works my brain seems to
00:23:31 work put my finger up vertically or if I put it horizontally or if I put it this way or that way it seems to me it's the
00:23:36 same the same circuits that are it's not the way it works the way the brain is compartmentalized seems to be very very
00:23:44 different than what I would have imagined if I were just doing psychological introspection about how things work my
00:23:54 conclusion is that we won't get it right that way but how will we get it right I think maybe computer scientists will get
00:24:03 it right eventually I don't think that any ways near it I don't even think they're thinking about it but by
00:24:08 computer eventually we will build machines perhaps which are complicated enough and partly engineered partly evolved
00:24:20 maybe evolved by machine learning and so forth this machine learning is very interesting by machine learning will
00:24:25 evolve systems and we may start to discover mechanisms that that have implications for how we
00:24:36 think and for what what does consciousness thing is all about and we'll be able to do experiments on them
00:24:45 and perhaps answer questions that we can't possibly answer by by introspection so that's a really
00:24:52 interesting point you've in many cases if you look even at string theory when you first think about a system it seems
00:24:58 really complicated like the human brain and through some basic reasoning then trying to discover a fundamental
00:25:07 low-level behavior of the system you find out that it's actually much simpler you one have you you know is that
00:25:14 generally the process and to do you have that also hope for biological systems as well for all the kinds of stuff we're
00:25:21 studying at the human level of course physics always begins by trying to find the simplest version of something an
00:25:27 analyzer yeah I mean there are lots of examples where physics has taken very complicated systems analyze them and
00:25:37 found simplicity in them for sure I said superconductors before it's an obvious one a superconductor seems like
00:25:43 monstrously complicated thing with all sorts of crazy electrical properties magnetic properties and so forth and
00:25:50 when it finally is boiled down through its simplest elements it's a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon called
00:26:01 spontaneous symmetry breaking and which we in other context we learned about and we're very familiar with so yeah I mean
00:26:10 yes we do take complicated things make them simple but what we don't want to do is take things which are intrinsically
00:26:17 complicated and fool ourselves into thinking that we can make them simple we don't want to make I don't know who said
00:26:23 this but we don't want to make them simpler than they really are right okay is the brain
00:26:30 a thing which ultimately functions by some simple rules or is it just complicated in terms of artificial
00:26:40 intelligence nobody really knows what are the limits of our current approaches you mentioned machine learning how do we
00:26:45 create human level intelligence it seems that there's a lot of very smart physicists who perhaps oversimplify the
00:26:51 nature of intelligence and think of it as information processing and therefore that it doesn't seem to be any
00:26:57 theoretical reason why we can't artificially create a human level or super human level intelligence in fact
00:27:05 the reasoning goes if you create human level intelligence the same approach you just used to create human level
00:27:12 intelligence should allow you to create superhuman level intelligence very easily exponentially so what do you
00:27:19 think that way of thinking that comes from physicists is all about I wish I knew but there's a particular reason why
00:27:26 I wish I knew I have a second job I consult for Google ah not for Google for Google X I am the
00:27:39 senior academic advisor third to a group of machine learning physicists at now that sounds crazy because I know nothing
00:27:48 about the subject I know very little about the subject on the other hand I'm good at giving advice so I give them
00:27:54 advice on things anyway I see these young physicists who are approaching the machine learning problem
00:28:00 there is a myth there is a real machine learning problem mainly why does it work as well as it does it nobody really
00:28:07 seems to understand why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations that it does and so forth and there are three
00:28:16 groups of people who have thought about this there are the engineers the engineers are incredibly smart but they
00:28:24 tend not to think as hard about why the thing is working as much as they do how to use it obviously they provided a lot
00:28:33 of data and it is they who demonstrated that machine learning can work much better than you have any right to expect
00:28:39 the machine learning systems are systems that the system is not too different than the kind of systems if this is a
00:28:46 study there's not all that much difference between quantum construction of mathematics physically yes but in the
00:28:55 structure the mathematics between a tension network designed to describe a quantum system on the one hand and the
00:29:03 kind of networks that are used in machine learning so they're more and more I think young physicists are being
00:29:12 drawn to this field of machine learning some very very good ones I work with a number of very good ones not on machine
00:29:20 learning but having lunch on having lunch yeah and I can tell you they are super smart they don't seem to be so
00:29:31 arrogant about their physics backgrounds that they think they can do things that nobody else can do
00:29:36 but those physics way of thinking I think will add will I had great value to UM will bring value to the machine learning
00:29:46 I believe it will and I think it already has and what time scale do you think predicting the future becomes useless in
00:29:56 your long experience and being surprised at new discoveries sometimes a day sometimes 20 years there are things
00:30:08 which I thought we were very far from understanding which practically in a snap of the fingers or a blink of the
00:30:16 eye suddenly became understood completely surprising for me there are other things which I looked at
00:30:25 and I said we're not gonna understand these things for 500 years in particular quantum gravity the scale for that was
00:30:33 20 years 25 years and we understand a lot and we don't understand it completely now by any means but we're I
00:30:39 thought it was 500 years to make any progress it turned out to be very very far from that it turned out to be more
00:30:45 like 20 or 25 years from the time when I thought it was 500 years so for me can we jump around quantum gravity some
00:30:56 basic ideas in physics what is the dream of string theory mathematically what is the hope where does it come from what
00:31:03 problems are trying to solve I don't think the dream of string theory is any different than the dream of fundamental
00:31:09 theoretical physics altogether understanding a unified theory of everything I I don't like thinking of
00:31:16 string theory as a subject unto itself with people called string theorists who are the practitioners of this thing
00:31:25 called string theory I much prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists trying to answer deep fundamental
00:31:32 questions about nature in particular gravity in particular gravity and it's connection with quantum mechanics and
00:31:40 who at the present time find string theory a useful tool rather than saying there's a subject called string
00:31:47 theorists I don't like being referred to as a string theorists yes but as a tool is it useful to think about our nature
00:31:55 in multiple dimensions the strings vibrating I believe it is useful I'll tell you what the main use of it has
00:32:02 been up till now well has had a number of main uses originally string theory was invented then I know there I was
00:32:09 there I was right at the spot where it was being invented literally and it was being invented to understand hey groans
00:32:18 hey drones are sub-nuclear particles at that time the late 60s early seventies it was clear from experiment
00:32:31 that these particles call hydrants had could vibrate could rotate could do all the things that a little closed string
00:32:46 can do and it was and is a valid and correct theory of these hydrants it's been experimentally tested and that is a
00:32:55 done deal it had a second life as a theory of gravity the same basic mathematics except on a very very much
00:33:04 smaller distance scale the objects of gravitation are nineteen orders of magnitude smaller than a proton but the
00:33:12 same mathematics turned up the same mathematics turned up what has been its value its value is that it's
00:33:20 mathematically rigorous in many ways and enabled us to to find to find mathematical structures which have both
00:33:31 quantum mechanics and gravity with rigor we can test out ideas we can test out ideas we can't test them in the
00:33:38 laboratory that nineteen orders of magnitude too small or things that were interested in but we can test them out
00:33:44 mathematically and analyze their internal consistency by now forty years ago thirty five years ago so forth
00:33:56 people very very much questioned the consistency between gravity and quantum mechanics Stephen Hawking was very
00:34:08 now nobody questions that consistency anymore they don't because we have mathematically precise string theories
00:34:16 which contain both gravity and quantum mechanics in a consistent way so it's provided that that certainty
00:34:25 that quantum mechanics and gravity can coexist that's not a small thing that's a very huge thing it's a huge thing
00:34:30 Einstein be proud Einstein he might be appalled I don't know I'm like a very much yeah he would
00:34:37 certainly be struck by it yeah I think that maybe at this time its biggest contribution to physics in illustrating
00:34:45 almost definitively that quantum mechanics and gravity are very closely related and not inconsistent with each
00:34:52 other is there a possibility of something deeper more profound that still is consistent with string theory
00:35:03 but is deeper that is to be found well you could ask the same theme of quantum mechanics is there something exactly
00:35:08 yeah yeah I think string theory is just an example of a quantum mechanical system that contains both gravitation
00:35:17 and in quantum mechanics so is there something underlying quantum mechanics perhaps something deterministic so have
00:35:25 something deterministic my friend far out it wolf whose name you may know he's a very famous physicist Dutch not as
00:35:34 famous as he should be but the heart dispels names it's hard to say his name you know it's easy to spelling ' he's
00:35:39 only person I know his name begins with an apostrophe and he's one of my heroes in physics and it's a little younger
00:35:46 than me but it's nonetheless one of my heroes the Tufte believes that there was some sub structure to the world which is
00:35:59 classical in character the deterministic in character which somehow by some mechanism that he has a hard time
00:36:08 spelling out emerges as quantum mechanics I don't the wavefunction is somehow emergent the wavefunction and
00:36:16 not just the wavefunction but the whole making the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics uncertainty and pango
00:36:24 meant all these things are emergent do you think quantum mechanics is the bottom of the well as is the right here
00:36:31 I think is here I think is where you have to be humble here's where humility comes I don't think anybody should say
00:36:38 anything is the bottom of the well at this time yes I think we I think we can reasonably say I can reasonably say when
00:36:48 I look into the well I can't see past quantum mechanics I don't see any reason for it to be anything beyond quantum
00:36:57 mechanics I think a tuft is a Sperry interesting and deep questions I don't like his answers well again let me ask
00:37:05 if we look at the deepest nature of reality with whether it's deterministic or unobserved
00:37:15 is probabilistic what does that mean for our human level of ideas of free will is there any connection whatsoever from
00:37:24 this perception perhaps illusion of free will that we have and the fundamental nature of reality the only thing I can
00:37:31 say is I am I am puzzled by that as much as you are the illusion of it the illusion of consciousness the illusion
00:37:41 of free will the illusion of self does that connect to how can a physical system do that and and I am as puzzled
00:37:50 as anybody there's echoes of it in the observer effect yeah so do you understand what it means to be an
00:37:56 observer I understand it at a technical level an observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom that it can
00:38:02 record information and which can become entangled with the thing that's measuring entanglement is the key when a
00:38:11 system which we call an apparatus or an observer same thing interacts with the system that it's observing it doesn't
00:38:20 just look at it it becomes physically entangled with it and it's that entanglement which we call an
00:38:25 observation or measure now does that satisfy me personally as an observer yes and no I find it
00:38:34 very satisfying that we have a mathematical representation of what it means to observe a system you are
00:38:42 observing stuff right now yeah the conscious level right is you think there's echoes of that kind of
00:38:49 entanglement in our macro scale yes absolutely for sure we're entangled with quantum mechanically entangled with
00:38:57 everything in this room if we weren't of and it was just well we wouldn't be observing it but on the other hand you
00:39:08 can ask though I really am I really comfortable with it and I'm uncomfortable with it in the same way
00:39:13 that I can never get comfortable with five dimensions my my brain isn't wired for it are you comfortable with four
00:39:23 dimensions a little bit more because I can always imagine the fourth dimension this time so the arrow of time are you
00:39:30 comfortable with that arrow do you think time is an emergent phenomena or is it's fundamental to nature that is a big
00:39:37 question in physics right now all the physics that we do or at least that the people that I am comfortable with
00:39:48 talking to my my friends yeah my friends no we all ask the same question that you just asked in space we have a pretty
00:39:56 good idea is emergent and it emerges out of tan tangle mint and other other things time always seems to be built into our
00:40:05 equations as just what Newton pretty much were for Newton modified a little bit by Einstein would have called time
00:40:16 and and mostly in our equations it is not emergent time in physics is completely symmetric forward and
00:40:25 bathymetric so you don't really need to think about the area of time for most physical phenomena the most microscopic
00:40:34 phenomena no it's only when the phenomena involves systems which are big enough for thermal
00:40:39 Amyx to become important the entropy to become important for small subsets a small system entropy is not a good
00:40:49 concept an entropy is something which which emerges out of large numbers it's a probabilistic idea it's a
00:40:57 statistical idea and it's a thermodynamic idea thermodynamics requires lots and lots and lots of
00:41:04 little sub structures okay so it's not until you emerge at the thermodynamic level that there's an arrow of time do
00:41:15 we understand it yeah I think I think we understand better than most people think that most people say they think we
00:41:20 understand it yeah I think we understand it it's just a statistical idea the you mean like second law thermodynamics
00:41:28 entropy and so on yeah the pack of cards and you're flinging it in the air and you look what happens to it yeah but
00:41:33 what's random we understand it doesn't go from random to simple it goes from simple to random but do you think it
00:41:43 ever breaks down what I think you can do is in a laboratory setting you can take a system which is somewhere intermediate
00:41:53 between being small and being large and make it go backward a thing which looks like it only wants to go forward because
00:42:01 of statistical mechanical reasons because of the second law you can very very carefully manipulate it to make it
00:42:10 run backward I don't think you can take an egg Humpty Dumpty who fell on the floor yeah and reverse that but you can
00:42:18 in a very controlled situation you can take systems which appear to be evolving statistically toward randomness stop
00:42:28 them reverse them and make them go back what's the intuition behind that how do how do we do that how do we reverse it a
00:42:35 clue you're saying closed system yeah pretty much closed system yes did you just say that time travel is possible no
00:42:43 I didn't say time travel is possible I said you can make a system go backward in time and you don't like it go back
00:42:49 you can make it reverse it steps you can make it reverse its trajectory yeah how do we do what's the intuition there does
00:42:58 it have is it just a fluke thing that we can do at a small scale in the lab that doesn't have what I'm saying is
00:43:03 you can do it on a little bit better than a small scale you can certainly do it with a simple small system small
00:43:12 systems don't have any sense of the arrow of time atoms atoms  no sense of the arrow of time they're completely
00:43:23 reversible it's only when you have you know the second law of thermodynamics is the law of large numbers say you can
00:43:31 break the law because it's not you can break German isn't the break it but it's hard it requires great care the bigger
00:43:38 the system is the more to care the more the harder it is you have to overcome what's called chaos and that's hard and
00:43:47 it requires more and more precision for 10 particles you might be able to do it with a with some effort 400 particles
00:43:57 it's really hard for a thousand or a million particles forget it but not for any fundamental reason just because it's
00:44:04 technologically too hard to make the system go backward so so note no time travel for engineering reasons oh no no
00:44:18 no what is time travel time travel time travel to the future that's easy yes you just close your eyes go to sleep
00:44:24 and you wake up in the future yeah yeah good nap gets you there yeah good map gets you there right
00:44:30 but in reversing the second law of thermal is a very difficult engineering effort I wouldn't call that time travel
00:44:43 because it gets to me too mixed up with what the science fiction calls time-travel right this is just the
00:44:52 ability to reverse a system you take the system and you reverse the direction of motion of every molecule in it that
00:45:00 input you can do it with one molecule if you find a particle moving in a certain direction let's not say a mama particle
00:45:08 a baseball you stop it dead and then you simply reverse its motion in principle that's not
00:45:14 too hard and it'll go back along its trajectory in the backward direction just running the program backwards
00:45:20 running the program backward yeah okay if you have two baseball's colliding well you can do it but you have to be
00:45:27 very very careful to get it just right now ten baseball's really really tore better yet tend ten billiard balls on an
00:45:37 idealized frictionless billiard table mm-hmm okay so you start the balls all in a triangle right and you're whack them yep
00:45:44 depending on the game you're playing you the wacom where you're really careful but the you're welcome
00:45:49 and they go flying off in all possible directions okay try to reverse that try to reverse that imagine trying to take
00:45:58 every billiard ball stopping it dated sometime at some point and reversing its motion so it was going in the opposite
00:46:05 direction if you did that with tremendous care it would reassemble itself back into the triangle okay that
00:46:15 is a fact and you can probably do it with two billiard balls maybe with three billion balls if you're really lucky but
00:46:22 what happens is as the system gets more and more complicated you have to be more and more precise not to make the tiniest
00:46:29 error because the tiniest errors will get magnified and you'll simply not be able to do the reversal so yeah you
00:46:37 could that but I wouldn't call that time travel yeah that's something else but if you think think of it it just made me
00:46:46 think if we think the unrolling of state that's happening as a program if we look at the world so the idea of looking at
00:46:58 the world as a simulation as a computer but it's not a computer it's just a single program a question arises that
00:47:07 might be useful how how hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe okay so there are mathematical universes
00:47:20 that we know about one of them is called anti de sitter space where we and it's quantum mechanics well I think
00:47:32 we could simulate it in a computer and a quantum computer classical computer all you can do is solve its equations you
00:47:38 can't make it work like the real system if we could build a quantum computer or big enough one robust enough one we
00:47:49 could probably simulate a universe a small version of an anti-de sitter universe and that the sitter is a kind
00:47:58 of cosmology so I think we know how to do that the trouble is the universe that we live in is not the anti-de sitter
00:48:07 geometry it's the decent or geometry and we don't really understand the quantum mechanics at all so at the present time
00:48:13 I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest idea how to simulate a universe similar to our own you know we could ask oh we
00:48:21 could we build in the laboratory a small version a quantum mechanical version the collection of quantum computers
00:48:33 entangled and the couple together which would reproduce the the phenomena that go on in the universe even on a small
00:48:41 scale yes if you were anti de sitter space know if it's the sitter space can you a slightly describe the sitter space
00:48:50 and anti-de sitter space yeah what are the geometric properties of big different they differ by a this is the
00:48:55 sine of a single constant called the cosmological constant one of them is negatively curved the other is
00:49:05 positively curved the anti-de sitter space which is the negatively curved one you can think of as an isolated system
00:49:14 in a box with reflecting walls you could think of it as a system of quantum mechanical system isolated in an
00:49:22 isolated environment the sitter space is the one we really live in and that's the one that's exponentially expanding
00:49:29 exponential expansion dark energy whatever you want to call it and we don't understand that mathematically do
00:49:37 we understand not everybody would agree with me but I don't understand they would agree with me they definitely
00:49:42 would agree with me that I don't understand it what about their an understanding of the
00:49:50 birth the origin no the bing bang so knows what normally theories there are theories my favorite is the one called
00:50:00 eternal inflation the infinity can be on both sides on one of the sides and none of the sides so what my real opinion okay
00:50:14 infinity on both sides oh boy yeah yeah that's why is that your favorite because it's the the most just mind-blowing no
00:50:24 because we want a beginning no why do we want a beginning I practiced it was the beginning of course and practice it was
00:50:34 a beginning but could it have been a random fluctuation in an otherwise infinite time maybe in any case the the
00:50:44 eternal inflation theory I think if correctly understood it would be infinite in both directions how do
00:50:53 you think about infinity Oh God so okay of course you can think about mathematically I just finished this I
00:50:59 just finished this discussion with my friend Sergey Brin yes how do you think about infinity I say well Sergey Brin is
00:51:08 infinitely rich how do you test that hypothesis okay essential good lines all right yeah so there's no there's really
00:51:18 no way to visualize some of these things like ya know this is a very good question those physics have any is does
00:51:27 infinity have any place in physics right right and well I can say is very good question so what do you think of the recent first
00:51:40 image of a black hole visualized from the event horizon telescope it it's an incredible triumph of science in
00:51:47 itself the fact that there are black holes which collide is not a surprise and they seem to work exactly the way
00:51:55 they're supposed to work will we learn a great deal from it I don't know I can I I we might but the kind of things we
00:52:09 why there are black holes in nature of that particular mass scale and why they're so common may tell us something
00:52:16 about the structure evolution of structure in the universe but I don't think it's going to tell us anything new
00:52:23 about black holes but it's a triumph in the sense that you go back a hundred years and it was a continuous
00:52:29 development general relativity the discovery of black holes LIGO the incredible technology that went into LIGO
00:52:42 it is something that I never would have believed was gonna happen you know 30 40 years ago and I think it's a magnificent
00:52:55 the structure magnificent thing this evolution of general relativity LIGO high precision ability to measure things
00:53:09 on a scale of 10 to the minus 21 so so you're just astonishing though we zoom all this just happy for us to this right
00:53:17 picture is it different you know you've thought a lot about black holes is it how did you visualize them in your mind
00:53:25 and is the picture different than you know lies that no it simply confirmed you know it's a magnificent triumph to
00:53:33 have confirmed confirmed a direct observation yeah that Einstein's theory of gravity at the level of black hole
00:53:43 collisions actually works is awesome and it's really awesome you know I know some of the people who were involved in that
00:53:49 they just thought married people yeah and the idea that they could carry this out I just don't I'm shocked yeah just
00:53:59 these little Homo sapiens yeah just these little monkeys got together right and took a picture of
00:54:08 slightly advanced lemurs I think what kind of questions can science not currently answer but you hope might be
00:54:14 able to soon well you you've already addressed them what is consciousness for example do you think that's within the
00:54:20 reach of science I think it's somewhat within the reach of science but I think that now I think it's in the hands of
00:54:25 the computer scientists and the neuroscientists I'm not a physicist perhaps with the helper haps at some
00:54:32 point but I think physicists will try to simplify it down to something that they can use their methods and maybe they're
00:54:40 not appropriate maybe we maybe we simply need to do more machine learning on bigger scales evolve machines machines
00:54:49 not only that learn but volve their own architecture as a process of learning evolve in
00:54:55 architecture not under our control only partially under our control but under the control of a machine learning I'll
00:55:01 tell you another thing that I find awesome you know this Google thing that they taught the computers how to play chess
00:55:09 yeah yeah okay they taught the computers how to play chess not by teaching them how to play chess but just having them
00:55:14 play against each other against each other itself against each other this is a form of evolution these machines
00:55:27 they evolved in intelligence without anybody telling them how to do it and we're not engineered they just played
00:55:34 against each other and got better and that makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence what exact kind of
00:55:47 intelligence I don't know but in understanding that better and better maybe we'll get better clues as to what
00:55:54 there goes on your life and intelligence is last question what kind of questions can science not currently answer and may
00:56:07 is there an intelligence out there that's underlies the whole thing you can call them with the G word if you want I
00:56:15 can say are we a computer simulation with a purpose is there an agent an intelligent agent that underlies or is
00:56:26 responsible for the whole thing does that intelligent agent satisfy the laws of physics does it satisfy the laws
00:56:33 of quantum mechanics is it made of atoms and molecules yeah there's a lot of questions and I don't see this it seems
00:56:41 to me a real question it's an answerable question well it's answerable the questions have to be
00:56:50 answerable to be real some philosophers would say that a question is not a question unless it's answerable this
00:56:58 question doesn't seem to me answerable by any known method but it seems to me real there's no better place to end
