00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Andrew and one of the most impactful educators researchers innovators and
00:00:09 leaders in artificial intelligence and technology space in general he co-founded Coursera and Google brain
00:00:18 launched deep learning AI landing AI and the AI fund and was the chief scientist at Baidu
00:00:25 as a Stanford professor and with Coursera and deep learning AI he has helped educate and inspire millions of
00:00:33 students including me this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on

00:01:23 Bitcoin let me mention that cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating I
00:01:31 recommend a cent of money as a great book on this history debits and credits on Ledger's started over 30,000 years
00:01:41 ago the US dollar was created over 200 years ago and Bitcoin the first decentralized cryptocurrency released
00:01:48 just over ten years ago so given that history cryptocurrency still very much in its early days of development but
00:01:56 it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money so again if you get cash app from the

00:02:20 and now here's my conversation with Andrew Eng the courses you taught on machine learning in Stanford and later
00:02:30 on Coursera the co-founded have educated and inspired millions of people so let me ask you what people are ideas
00:02:35 inspired you to get into computer science and machine learning when you were young when did you first fall in
00:02:42 love with the field there's another way to put it growing up in Hong Kong Singapore I
00:02:48 started learning to code when I was five or six years old at that time I was learning the basic programming language
00:02:55 and they would take these folks and you know they'll tell you typed this program into your computer so typed that
00:03:01 programs my computer and as a result of all that typing I would get to play these very simple shoot-'em-up games
00:03:08 that you know I had implemented on my own minds old computer so I thought was fascinating as a young kid that I could
00:03:15 write this code that's really just copying code from a book into my computer to then play these cool of
00:03:23 video games another moment for me was when I was a teenager and my father because his doctor was reading about
00:03:31 expert systems and about neural networks so he got me read some of these books and I thought was really cool you could
00:03:37 write a computer that started to exhibit intelligence then I remember doing an internship was in high school this isn't
00:03:46 Singapore where I remember doing a lot of photocopying and and I was office assistants and the highlight of my job
00:03:53 was when I got to use the shredder so the teenager me remote thinking boy this is a lot of photocopying if only we
00:03:59 could write software build a robot something to automate this maybe I could do something else so I think a lot of my
00:04:06 work since then has centered on the theme of automation even the way I think about machine learning today were very
00:04:12 good at writing learning algorithms they can automate things that people can do or even launching the first MOOCs
00:04:18 massive open online courses that later led to Coursera I was trying to also meet what could be automatable in how I
00:04:25 was teaching on campus process of Education tried to automate parts of that make it more
00:04:32 to have more impact from a single teacher single educator yeah I felt you know teaching Stanford teaching machine
00:04:40 learning it's about 400 students a year at the time and I found myself filming the exact same video every year telling
00:04:49 the same jokes the same room and I thought why am I doing this well just take last year's video and then I can
00:04:53 spend my time building a deeper relationship with students so he has process of thinking through how to do
00:04:59 that that led to the first first moves that we launched and then you have more time to write new jokes are their
00:05:07 favorite memories from your early days at Stanford teaching thousands of people in person and then millions of people
00:05:16 online you know teaching online what not many people know was that a lot of those videos were shot between the
00:05:28 hours of 10:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. a lot of times we were watching the first moves that fit with our announcer course
00:05:33 but a hundred thousand people have signed up we just started to write the code and we had not yet actually filmed
00:05:40 the video so you know a lot of pressure a hundred thousand people waiting for us to produce the content so many Friday
00:05:47 Saturday's I would go out have dinner my friends and then I was thinking okay do I want to go home now or do you want to
00:05:55 go to the office to film videos and the thoughts of you know that helped hundred thousand people potentially learn
00:06:01 machine learning unfortunately that made me think okay I'm gonna go to my office go to my time in the recording studio I
00:06:08 would adjust my Logitech webcam adjust my you know Wacom tablet make sure my lapel mic was on and then I was not
00:06:15 recording often until 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. I think I'm fortunate it doesn't doesn't show that it was recorded that
00:06:21 late at night but it was really inspiring the the thought that we could create content to help so many people
00:06:28 learn about machine learning how does that feel the fact that you're probably somewhat along maybe a couple of friends
00:06:36 recording with a logitech webcam and kind of going home alone at 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. at night and knowing that
00:06:43 that's going to reach sort of thousands of people eventually millions of people is what's that feeling like I
00:06:50 mean is there a feeling of just satisfaction of pushing through I think is humbling and I wasn't thinking about
00:06:58 what I was viewing I think one thing we I'm proud to say we caught right from the early days was I told my whole team
00:07:06 back then that the number one priority is to do what's best for learnis to asbestos students and so when I went in
00:07:12 a recording studio the only thing on my mind was what can I say how can I design my slides ready to draw a right to make
00:07:19 these concepts as clear as possible for lehre news I think you know I've seen sometimes
00:07:24 instructors is tempting hey let's talk about my work maybe if I teach you about my research
00:07:29 someone will cite my papers a couple more times and I think one things we got right launch the first few MOOCs and
00:07:35 later building Coursera was putting in place that bedrock principle let's just do what's best for learners then forget
00:07:41 about everything else and I think that that is a guiding principle turns out to be really important to the to the rise
00:07:47 of the movement and the kind of learner your imagined in your mind is as as broad as possible as global as possible
00:07:56 so really try to reach as many people interested in machine learning and AI as possible I really want to help anyone
00:08:02 that had an interest in machine learning to break into fields and and I think sometimes eventually people ask me hey
00:08:10 why you spend so much time explaining gradient descent and then and my answer was if I look at what I think to learn
00:08:17 they need somewhat benefit from I felt that having that a good understanding of the foundations coming back to the
00:08:23 basics would put them in a better stead to then build on a long term career so you've tried to consistently make
00:08:30 decisions on that principle so one of the things you actually revealed to the narrow AI community at the time and to
00:08:39 the world is that the amount of people who are actually interested in AI is much larger than we imagined by you
00:08:45 teaching the class and how popular became it showed that wow this isn't just a small community of
00:08:54 sort of people who go to Europe's and and it's much bigger it's the developers it's people from all over the
00:09:01 world from front I mean I'm Russian so as everybody in Russia is really interested this is a huge number of
00:09:05 programmers who are interested in machine learning India China South America everywhere that there's just
00:09:12 millions of people who are interested machine learning so how big you get a sense that this number of people is that
00:09:20 are interested in your perspective I think the numbers grown over time I think I'm one of those things that maybe
00:09:26 it feels like it came out of nowhere but it's an insider building it it took years there's all those overnight
00:09:32 successes that took years to get there my first foray into this type of education was when we were filming my
00:09:38 Stanford class and sticking the videos on YouTube and then some other things with uploading the holes and so on but
00:09:44 you know basically the one hour fifteen minute video that we put on YouTube and then we had four or five other versions
00:09:52 of websites that had built most of what you would never have heard of because they reach small audiences but that
00:09:58 allowed me to iterate allow my team and me to innovate to learn what the ideas that work and what doesn't for example
00:10:04 one of the features I was really excited about and really proud of was build this website where multiple people could be
00:10:10 logged into the website at the same time so today if you go to a website you know if you're logged in and then I want to
00:10:17 log in you need to log out it was the same browser the same computer but I thought well one of two people say you
00:10:23 and me were watching a video together in front of the computer what if a website could have you type your name and
00:10:28 password hit me type in their password and then now the computer knows both of us are watching together and it gives
00:10:34 both of us credit for anything we do as a group influences feature rolled it out in a higher in school in San Francisco
00:10:43 we had about 20-something users worth the teacher there Sacred Heart Cathedral prep teachers great and guess what
00:10:50 zero people use the speaker it turns out people studying online they want to watch the videos by themselves so you
00:10:56 can playback pause at your own speed rather than in groups so that was one example of a tiny lesson learned out of
00:11:03 many that allows us to hone in to the set of features and it sounds like a brilliant feature so I guess the lesson
00:11:10 to take from that is you there's something that looks amazing on paper and then nobody uses it doesn't
00:11:17 actually have the in the impact that you think it might have and so yeah I saw that you really went through a lot of
00:11:22 different features and a lot of ideas you had to arrive at the final at Coursera its final kind of powerful
00:11:29 thing that showed the world that MOOCs can educate millions and I think with how machine learning movements as
00:11:37 well I think it didn't come out of nowhere instead what happened was as more people learned about machine
00:11:43 learning they will tell their friends and their friends will see how the big world to their work and then and in the
00:11:49 community kept on growing and I think we're still growing you know I don't know in the future what percentage of
00:11:56 our developers would be AI developers I could easily see it being more for 50 percent right because so many a I
00:12:05 developers broadly construed not just people doing the machine learning modeling but the people but the
00:12:09 infrastructure data pipelines you know all the software's surrounding the old machine learning model maybe is even bigger
00:12:17 I feel like today almost every software engineer has some understanding of the clouds no oh you know but maybe this is
00:12:24 my microcontroller developer doesn't need to do the cloud but I feel like the vast majority of software in Jesus today
00:12:31 are sort of having appreciated the cloud I think in the future maybe we'll approach nearly a hundred percent of all
00:12:38 developers being you know in some way an AI developer or at least having an appreciation of machine learning and my
00:12:44 hope is that there's this kind of effect that there's people who are not really interested in soft being a programmer or
00:12:51 being into software engineering like biologists chemists and physicists even mechanical engineers and all these
00:12:59 disciplines that are now more and more sitting on large data sets and here they didn't think they're interested in
00:13:05 programming until they have this data set and they realized there's the set of machine learning tools that allow you to
00:13:10 use the data set so they actually become they learn to program and they become new programmer so like the not just
00:13:16 because you've mentioned a larger percentage of developers become machine learning people the it seems like more
00:13:24 and more the the kinds of people who are becoming developers is also growing significantly yeah yeah I think I think once upon a
00:13:31 time only a small part of humanity was literate you could read and write and and and maybe you thought maybe not
00:13:37 everyone needs to learn to read and write you know you just go listen to a few monks write me to you and maybe that
00:13:45 was enough or maybe we just need a few handful of authors to write the bestsellers and then no one else needs
00:13:51 to write but what we found was that by giving as many people you know in some countries almost everyone basically
00:13:58 literacy it dramatically enhanced human to human communications and we can now write for an audience of one such as if
00:14:03 I send you an email you send me an email I think in computing we're still in that phase where so few people know how the
00:14:11 codes that the code is mostly have to code for relatively large audiences but if everyone well most people became
00:14:21 developers at some level similar to how most people and develop economies are somewhat literate I would love to see
00:14:28 the owners of a mom-and-pop store be with a very little code to customize the TV display for their special this week
00:14:34 and I think of it enhance human to computer communications which is becoming more more important today as
00:14:40 well so you think you think it's possible that machine learning becomes kind of similar to literacy where we're
00:14:48 yeah like you said the owners of a mom-and-pop shop is basically everybody in all walks of life would have some
00:14:54 degree of programming capability I could see society getting there there's one other interesting thing you
00:15:02 know if I go talk to the mom and pop store if I toss a lot of people in their daily professions I previously didn't
00:15:07 have a good story for why they should learn to code yeah we give them some reasons but what I found with the rise
00:15:14 of machine learning and data science is that I think the number of people with a concrete use for data science in their
00:15:21 daily lives and their jobs may be even larger than the number of people of a country used for software engineering
00:15:26 for example if you were actually run a small mom-and-pop store I think if you can analyze the data about your sales
00:15:32 your customers I think there's actually real value there maybe even more than traditional software engineer
00:15:39 so I find that for a lot of my friends in various professions being recruiters or accountants or you know people that
00:15:45 work in the factories which I deal with more and more these days I feel if they were data scientists at some level they
00:15:53 could immediately use that in their work so I think that data science and machine learning may be an even easier entree into the
00:16:01 developer world for a lot of people then the software engineering that's interesting and I grew that but that's a
00:16:08 beautifully put we live in a world where most courses and talks have slides PowerPoint keynote and yet you famously
00:16:15 often still use a marker and a whiteboard the simplicity of that is compelling in for me at least fun to
00:16:23 watch so let me ask why do you like using a marker and whiteboard even on the biggest of stages I think it depends
00:16:32 on the concepts you want to explain for mathematical concepts it's nice to build at the equation one piece at a time
00:16:40 and the whiteboard marker or the pen is stylus is a very easy way you know to build up the equation a build up a
00:16:46 complex concept one piece at a time while you're talking about it and sometimes that enhances
00:16:53 understandability the downside of writing is as it slow and so if you want a long sentence it's very hard to write
00:16:58 that so I think their pros and cons in sometimes I use slides and sometimes they use a whiteboard or a stylus the
00:17:05 slowness of a whiteboard is also it's upside is it forces you to reduce everything to the basics some of some of
00:17:14 your talks and involve the whiteboard I mean there's really none but you go very slowly and you really focus on the most
00:17:22 simple principles and that's a beautiful that enforces a kind of a minimalism of ideas that I think is surprisingly least
00:17:32 for me is is great for education like a great talk I think is not one that has a lot of content a great talk is one that
00:17:41 just clearly says a few simple ideas and I think you the white board somehow enforces that Peter erbil who's now one
00:17:50 of the top roboticists and reinforcement learning experts in the world was your first PhD student hey so I bring him up just
00:17:58 because I kind of imagine this is this was must have been an interesting time in your life do you have any favorite
00:18:05 memories of working with Peter your first student in those uncertain times especially before deep learning really
00:18:16 really sort of blew up any favorite memories from those times you know I was really fortunate to have had Peter of
00:18:23 you as my first PhD students and I think even my long-term professional success builds on early foundations or early
00:18:29 work that that Peter was so critical to so I was really grateful to him for working at me you know what
00:18:37 not a lot of people know is just how hard research was and and so is Peter's PhD thesis was using reinforcement
00:18:48 learning to fly helicopters and so you know actually even today the website Helly thought stanford.edu heö I don't
00:18:53 Stanford are you still up here watch videos of us using reinforcement learning to make the helicopter fly
00:18:59 upside down five loops rolls this is cool so one of the most incredible robotics videos ever so how do you still
00:19:04 watch it oh yeah thanks firing that's from like 2000 it's eight or seven or six like that really
00:19:12 my dad's like yeah so is over ten years old that was really inspiring to a lot of people yeah but not many people see
00:19:21 is how hard it was so Peter and Adam codes and Morgan Quigley and I work on various versions of the helicopter and a
00:19:27 lot of things did not work for example turns out one of the hardest problems we had was when the helicopters flying
00:19:33 around upside down doing stunts how do you figure out the position how do you localize a helicopter so we want to try
00:19:40 all sorts of things having one GPS unit doesn't work because you're flying upside down the GPS units facing down so
00:19:45 you can't see the satellites so we tried them we experimented trying to have two GPS units one facing up one facing the
00:19:51 house if you flip over that didn't work because the downward facing one couldn't synchronize if you're flipping quickly
00:19:58 Morgan quickly was exploring this crazy complicated configuration of specialized hardware to interpret GPS signal
00:20:06 look into FPGA is completely insane spent about a year working on that didn't work so I remember Peter great
00:20:15 guy him and me you know sitting down in my office looking at saw the latest things we had tried that didn't work and
00:20:23 saying you know Don it like what now because because we tried so many things in it and it just didn't work in the end
00:20:31 what we did when Adam Cole's was was crucial to this was put cameras on the ground and used cameras on the ground to
00:20:38 localize a helicopter and that soft a localization problem so that we couldn't focus on the reinforcement learning and
00:20:43 inverse reinforcement learning techniques so didn't actually mean to helicopter fly and you know I'm reminded
00:20:51 when when was doing this work at Stanford around that time there was a lot of reinforcement learning
00:20:57 theoretical papers but not a lot of practical applications so the autonomous helicopter work for fine helicopters was
00:21:05 this one of the few you know practical applications of reinforcer learning at the time which which caused it to become
00:21:12 pretty well known I I feel like we might have almost come full circle with today there's so much but so much hype so much
00:21:18 excitement yeah about reinforcement learning but again we're hunting for more applications and all of these great
00:21:25 ideas that delica he's come up with what was the drive sort of in the face of the fact that most people doing theoretical
00:21:31 work what motivate you in the uncertainty and the challenges to get the helicopter sort of to do the the
00:21:38 applied work to get the actual system to work yeah in the face of fear uncertainty is sort of the setbacks the
00:21:46 you mentioned for localization I like stuff that works III know physical world so like it's
00:21:53 this back to the shredder and you know III like theory but when I work on theory myself and this personal taste
00:21:59 I'm not seeing anyone else should do what I do but when I work on theory I Percy enjoyed more if I feel that my the
00:22:08 work I do will influence people have positive impact will help someone I remember when many years ago our
00:22:16 speaking with a mathematics professor and it kind of just said hey ytt what you do and then he said he you know he
00:22:25 had stars in his eyes when he answered and this mathematician not from Stanford different University he said I do what I do
00:22:34 because it helps me to discover truth and beauty in the universe here starts analyzing he said yeah and I thought
00:22:39 that's great I don't want to do that I think it's great that someone does that fully
00:22:45 supportive people that do a lot of respect review that but I am more motivated when I can see a line to how
00:22:53 the work that my team's and I are doing house people the world needs all sorts of people I'm just one type hoping
00:23:01 everyone should do things the same way as I do but when I delve into either theory or practice if I personally have
00:23:08 conviction you know that here's a pathway to help people I find that more satisfying to have that conviction that
00:23:18 that's your path you were a proponent of deep learning before it gained widespread acceptance what did you see
00:23:25 in this field that gave you confidence what was your thinking process like in that first decade of the I don't know
00:23:34 that's called 2000s the odds yeah I can tell you the thing we got wrong with the thing we got right the thing we really
00:23:40 got wrong was the importance of the early importance of unsupervised learning so early days of Google brain
00:23:48 we put a lot of effort into unsupervised learning rather than supervised learning and those as argument I think was around
00:23:56 them 2005 after a new Europe's at that time called nips but now in Europe said ended and Geoff Hinton and I were
00:24:02 sitting in the cafeteria outside you know the conference we had lunch was chatting and Geoff pulled up this napkin
00:24:07 he started sketching this argument on her on a napkin it was very compelling as our repeated
00:24:14 human brain has about a hundred trillion so there's 10 to the 14 synaptic connections you will live about 10 10
00:24:22 and 9 seconds that's 30 years you actually live for two to two by ten to nine maybe three right
00:24:26 nine seconds so just let's say ten to nine so if each synaptic connection each weight in your brains new network has
00:24:35 just a one bit parameter that's 10 to the 14 bits you need to learn in up to 10 to 9 seconds of your life so via the
00:24:44 simple argument which is a lot of problems it's very simplified that's 10 to the 5 bits per second you need to
00:24:50 learn in your life and I have a one-year-old daughter I am NOT pointing out 10 to 5 bits per second of labels to
00:25:01 her so and and I think I'm a very loving parent but I'm just not gonna do that so from this you know very crude
00:25:09 definitely problematic argument there's just no way that most of what we know is through supervised learning the wife you
00:25:15 get so many visit information is from sucking in images audio those experiences in the world and so that
00:25:22 arguments and a lot of known forces argument you go going to really convince me that there's a lot of power to
00:25:30 unsupervised learning so that was the part that we actually maybe maybe gone wrong I still think I was learning is
00:25:37 really important but we but but in the early days you know 10 15 years ago and all of us thought that was the path
00:25:42 forward oh so you're saying that that that perhaps was the wrong intuition for the time for the time that that was the
00:25:49 part we got wrong the part we got right was the importance of scale so Adam calls another wonderful person fortunate
00:25:59 said worth of him he was in my group of Stanford at the time and Adam had run these experiments at Stanford showing
00:26:05 that the bigger we train a learning algorithm the better performance and it was based on that it was a graph that
00:26:13 hadn't generated you know where the x-axis y-axis lines going up into the right so bigger paint make this thing
00:26:19 the better his performance accuracy is the vertical axis so it's really based on that chart that Adam generated that
00:26:24 he gave me the conviction that you could scale these models way bigger than what we could on the few CPUs we should
00:26:30 understand that then we could get even better results and it was really based on that one figure that Adam generated
00:26:37 that gave me the conviction to go of Sebastian's to pitch you know starting starting a project at Google which became the
00:26:44 CooCoo brain crunch brain you know filing Google brain and there the intuition was scale will bring
00:26:52 performance for the system so we should chase larger and larger scale and I think people don't don't realize how how
00:27:01 groundbreaking of it is simple but it's a groundbreaking idea that bigger data sets will result in better performance
00:27:07 it was cultural first it was controversial at the time some of my well-meaning friends you know see any
00:27:11 people in the machine or in community I won't name but whose people told people of some some of whom we know my
00:27:18 well-meaning friends came and we're trying to give me friendly meze hey Andrew why are you doing this is crazy
00:27:23 it's in the near enough architecture look at these architectures of building you just like go for scale like there's
00:27:28 a bad career move so so my well-meaning friends you know we're trying to some of them we're trying to talk me out of it
00:27:35 if I find it if you want to make a breakthrough you sometimes have to have conviction and do something before it's
00:27:41 popular since that lets you have a bigger impact let me ask you just a small tangent on that topic I find
00:27:49 myself arguing with people saying that greater scale especially in the context of active learning so it's very
00:27:57 carefully selecting the data set but growing the scale of the data set is going to lead to even further
00:28:02 breakthroughs in deep learning and there's currently pushback at that idea that larger datasets are no longer that
00:28:10 so you want to increase the efficiency of learning you want to make better learning mechanisms and I personally
00:28:17 believe that bigger data sets will still with the same learning methods we have now result in better performance what's
00:28:24 your intuition at this time on those I Anna this dual side is do we need to come up with better architectures for
00:28:33 learning or can we just get bigger better data sets that will improve performance I think both are important
00:28:41 and there's also problem dependent so for a few data sets we may be approaching your Bayes error rate of
00:28:48 approaching or surpassing human level performance and then there's that theoretical ceiling that we will
00:28:55 a surface of a CRE but then I think there plenty of problems where we're we're still quite far from either human
00:29:00 of a performance all from Bayes error rate and bigger data says with new networks but without further elaborate
00:29:08 innovation will be sufficient to take us further but on the flip side if we look at the recent breakthroughs using you
00:29:14 know transforming networks for language models it was a combination of novel architecture but also scale has a lot to
00:29:21 do with it if we look at what happened with your GP - and birds I think scale was a large part of the
00:29:27 story yeah that's that's not often talked about is the scale of the data set it was trained on and the quality of
00:29:35 the data set because there's some so it was like reddit threads that had they were operated highly so there's already
00:29:43 some weak supervision on a very large data set that people don't often talk about right
00:29:49 I find it today we have maturing processes to managing cold things like get right version control it took us a
00:29:58 long time to evolve the good processes I remember when my friends and I were emailing each other C++ files in email
00:30:04 you know but then we had was that CVS subversion get maybe something else in the future we're very immature in terms
00:30:11 of Susa managing data and think about how the creator and how the soft I'm very hot messy data problems I think
00:30:17 there's a lot of innovation there to be I still I love the idea that you were versioning through email I'll give you
00:30:26 one example when we work with manufacturing companies is not at all uncommon for there to be multiple late
00:30:36 lists that disagree of each other right and so we were doing the work in visual inspection we will you know take say a
00:30:44 plastic cards and show to one inspector and the inspector sometimes very opinionated there go clearly that's the
00:30:50 defector scratch understand so gonna check this part take the same parts of different inspector different very
00:30:56 opinionated clearly the scratch is small is fine don't throw it away you're gonna make us
00:31:00 yours and then sometimes you take the same plastic part show it to the same inspector in the afternoon and I suppose
00:31:05 in the morning and very affinity go in the morning to say clearly is okay in the afternoon
00:31:11 equally confident clearly this is a defect and so what does the i-team supposed to do if if sometimes even one
00:31:18 person doesn't agree of himself or herself in the span of a day so I think these are the types of very practical
00:31:26 very messy data problems that that you know that my teams wrestle with in the case of large consumer Internet
00:31:33 companies where you have a billion users you have a lot of data you don't worry about they just take the average it kind
00:31:40 of works but in a case of other industry settings we don't have big data if just a small data very small the users maybe
00:31:49 100 defective parts or 100 examples of a defect if you have only 100 examples these little labeling errors you know if
00:31:55 10 of your hundred labels aren't wrong that actually is 10% it is that has a big impact so how do you clean this up
00:32:01 what you're supposed to do this is an example of the of the types of things that my team's did this is a landing AI
00:32:08 example are wrestling with to deal with small data which comes up all the time once you're outside consumer internet
00:32:13 yeah that's fascinating so then you invest more effort in time in thinking about the actual labeling process what
00:32:21 are the labels what are the how our disagreements resolved in all those kinds of like pragmatic real world
00:32:27 problems that's a fascinating space yeah I find it actually when I'm teaching at Stanford I increasingly encourage
00:32:34 students at Stanford to try to find their own project for the end of term project rather than
00:32:40 just downloading someone else's nicely clean data set it's actually much harder if you need to go and define your own
00:32:45 problem and find your own dataset rather than you go to one of the several good websites very good websites with with
00:32:51 creams scopes datasets that you could just work on you're now running three efforts the AI
00:33:01 fund landing AI and deep learning AI as you've said the AI fund is involved in creating new companies from scratch
00:33:08 Landing AI is involved in helping already established companies do AI and deep learning AI is for education of
00:33:16 everyone else or of individuals interested of getting into the field and excelling in
00:33:21 so let's perhaps talk about each of these areas first deep learning that AI how the basic question how does a person
00:33:30 interested in deep learning get started in the field the Atlanta AI is working to create courses to help people break
00:33:40 into AI so my machine learning course that I taught through Stanford is one of the most popular causes on Coursera to
00:33:47 this day it's probably one of the courses sort of if I ask somebody how did you get into machine learning or how
00:33:53 did you fall in love with machine learning or will get you interested they it always goes back to rain and Drang at
00:34:01 some point you won't find the amount of people you influence is ridiculous so for that I'm sure I speak for a lot of
00:34:07 people say big thank you no yeah thank you you know I was once reading a news article I think it was tech review and
00:34:17 I'm gonna mess up the statistic but I remember reading article that said something like one-third of all
00:34:24 programmers are self-taught I may have the number one third Romney was two-thirds but I rent an article I
00:34:28 thought this doesn't make sense everyone is self-taught because you teach yourself I don't teach people and
00:34:35 it's no good haha oh yeah so how does one get started in deep learning and where does deep learning that AI fit
00:34:40 into that so the define specialization offered by today is is this I think one it was
00:34:50 called service specialization it might still be so it's very popular way for people to take that specialization to
00:34:57 learn about everything from new networks to how to tune in your network so what is it confident to what is a RNA nor
00:35:05 sequence model or what is an attention model and so the design specialization steps everyone's through those
00:35:12 algorithms so you deeply understand it and can implement it and use it you know for whatever a from the very beginning
00:35:19 so what would you say the prerequisites for somebody to take the deep learning specialization in terms of maybe math or
00:35:26 programming background you know need to understand basic programming since there are Pro exercises in Python
00:35:34 and the map prereq is quite basic so no calculus is needed if you know calculus is great you get better
00:35:40 intuitions but deliberately try to teach that specialization without requirement calculus so I think high school math
00:35:47 would be sufficient if you know how to Mouse by two matrices I think I think that that deaths that desperates
00:35:54 so little basically in your algebra it's great basically the algebra even very very basically the algebra and some
00:36:01 programming I think that people that done the machine learning also find a deep learning specialization a bit
00:36:06 easier but is also possible to jump into the divine specialization directly but it'll be a little bit harder since we
00:36:14 tend to you know go over faster concepts like how does gradient descent work and what is an objective function which
00:36:19 which is covered mostly in the machine learning course could you briefly mention some of the key concepts in deep
00:36:25 learning that students should learn that you envision them learning in the first few months in the first year or so so if
00:36:32 you take the d-line specialization you learned foundations of what is in your network how do you build up in your
00:36:38 network from a you know single which is a unit stack of layers to different activation functions you don't have a
00:36:45 trained in your networks one thing I'm very proud of in that specialization as we go through a lot of practical
00:36:51 know-how of how to actually make these things work so what the differences between different optimization
00:36:56 algorithms so what do you do of the algorithm over things so how do you tell the algorithm is overfitting when you
00:37:00 collect more data when should you not bother to collect more data I find that even today unfortunately
00:37:09 there are your engineers that will spend six months trying to pursue a particular direction such as collect more data
00:37:15 because we heard more data is valuable but sometimes you could run some tests and could have figured out six months
00:37:21 earlier therefore this problem collecting more data isn't going to cut it so just don't spend seconds
00:37:27 collecting more data spend your time modifying the architecture or trying something also go through a lot of the
00:37:34 practical know-how also that when when when when someone will you take the deviant specialization you have those
00:37:40 skills to be very efficient in how you build is net so dive right in to play with the
00:37:46 network to train it to do the inference on a particular data set to build an intuition about it without without
00:37:52 building it up too big to where you spend like you said six months learning building up your big project without
00:38:00 building an intuition of a small small aspect of the data that could already tell you everything needs you know about
00:38:08 that date yes and also the systematic frameworks of thinking for how to go about building practical machine
00:38:13 learning maybe to make an analogy when we learn to code we have to learn the syntax of some Korean language right
00:38:20 be a Python or C++ or octave or whatever but that equally important that may be even more important part of coding is to
00:38:27 understand how to string together these lines of code into coherent things so you know when should you put something
00:38:32 in the function call and when should you not know how do you think about abstraction so those frameworks are what
00:38:39 makes the programmer efficient even more than understanding to syntax I remember when I was an undergrad at Carnegie
00:38:46 Mellon one of my friends with debug their codes by first trying to compile it and then it was T plus s code and
00:38:53 then every line did a syntax error they want to care for the syntax errors as quickly as possible so how do you do
00:38:57 that well they would delete every single line of code with a syntax error so really efficient for general syntax
00:39:03 errors were horrible service I think so we learned how the debug and I think in machine learning the way you
00:39:09 debug the machine learning program is very different than the way you you know like do binary search or whatever use
00:39:14 the debugger I traced through the code in in traditional software engineering so isn't evolving discipline but I find
00:39:20 that the people that are really good at debugging machine learning algorithms are easily 10x
00:39:26 maybe 100x faster at getting something to work so and the basic process of debugging is so the the bug in this case
00:39:35 why is in this thing learning learning improving sort of going into the questions of overfitting and all those
00:39:41 kinds of things that's that's the logical space that the debugging is happening in would in your network
00:39:49 yeah the often question is why doesn't it work yet well can I expect it eventually work and what are the things
00:39:54 I could try change the architecture malteaser more regularization different optimization
00:40:01 algorithm you know the different types of data are so to answer those questions systematically so that you don't heading
00:40:06 down so you don't spend six months hitting down the blind alley before someone comes and says why you spent six
00:40:13 months doing this what concepts and deep learning do you think students struggle the most with or sort of this is the
00:40:19 biggest challenge for them was to get over that hill it's it hooks them and it inspires them
00:40:28 and they really get it similar to learning mathematics I think one of the challenges of deep learning is that
00:40:34 there are lot of concepts that build on top of each other if you ask me what's hard about mathematics I have a hard
00:40:41 time pinpointing one thing is it addition subtraction is it carry is it multiplication long there's lot of stuff
00:40:47 I think one of the challenges of learning math and of learning certain technical fields is that a lot of
00:40:53 concepts and you miss a concept then you're kind of missing the prerequisite for something that comes later so in the
00:41:02 deep learning specialization try to break down the concepts to maximize the answer each component being
00:41:08 understandable so when you move on to the more advanced thing we learn your confidence hopefully you have enough
00:41:14 intuitions from the earlier sections to then understand why we structure confidence in a certain certain way and
00:41:21 then eventually why we build you know our nn zone ellos tienen or attention model in a certain way a building on top
00:41:28 of the earlier concepts I'm curious you you you do a lot of teaching as well do you have a do you have a favorite this
00:41:35 is the hard concept moment in your teaching well I don't think anyone's ever turned the interview on me I think that's a
00:41:49 really good question yeah it's it's it's really hard to capture the moment when they struggle I think you put a really
00:41:54 eloquently I do think there's moments that are like aha moments that really inspire people I think for some reason
00:42:03 reinforcement learning especially deep reinforcement learning is a really great way to really inspire people and get
00:42:12 what the use of neural networks can do even though you know networks really are just a part of the deep RL framework but
00:42:20 it's a really nice way to the to paint the entirety of the picture of a neural network being able to learn from scratch
00:42:27 knowing nothing and explore the world and pick up lessons I find that a lot of the aha moments happen when you use deep
00:42:36 RL to teach people about neural networks which is counterintuitive I find like a lot of the inspired sort of fire and
00:42:42 people's passion people's eyes comes from the RL world do you find I mean first of all learning and to be a useful
00:42:51 part of the teaching process or not I still teach me forceful learning and one of my Stanford classes and my PhD thesis
00:43:00 wonderful so nice thank you I find it if I'm trying to teach students the most useful techniques for them to use today
00:43:07 I end up shrinking the amount of time and talk about reinforce another in English it's not what's working today
00:43:12 now our world changes so fast maybe it does be totally different in a couple years I think we need a couple more
00:43:19 things for reinforcement learning to get there if you get there yeah one of my teams is looking to reinforce the
00:43:23 learning for some robotic control toss so I see the applications but if you look at it as a percentage of all of the
00:43:29 impact of you know the types of things we do is at least today outside of you know playing video games right in a few
00:43:39 of the games the the scope nearest a bunch of us was standing around saying hey what's your best example of an
00:43:44 actual deploy reinforcement learning application and you know among your like scene in machine learning researchers
00:43:51 right and again there are some emerging ones but there are there are not that many great
00:43:56 examples well I think you're absolutely right the sad thing is there hasn't been a big application impactful real-world
00:44:04 application reinforcement learning I think its biggest impact to me has been in the toy domain in the game domain in
00:44:12 a small example that's what I mean for educational purpose it seems to be a fun thing to explore new networks with but I
00:44:19 think from your perspective and I think that might be the best perspective is if you're trying to educate with a simple
00:44:26 example in order to illustrate how this can actually be grown to scale and have a real world impact then perhaps
00:44:33 focusing on the fundamentals of supervised learning in the context of you know a simple data set even like an
00:44:42 eminence data set is the right way is the right path to take I just the amount of fun I've seen people have of the
00:44:48 reinforcement learning it's been great but not in the applied impact on the real-world setting so it's a it's a
00:44:55 trade-off how much impact you want to have versus how much fun you want to have yeah that's really cool and I feel
00:45:00 like you know the world actually needs also even within machine learning I feel like deep learning is so exciting but the AI
00:45:08 team shouldn't just use deep learning I find that my team's use a portfolio of tools and maybe that's not the exciting
00:45:15 thing to say but some days we use internet some days we use a you know the PC a the other day are sitting down with
00:45:23 my team looking at PC residuals trying to figure out what's going on with PC applied to manufacturing problem and
00:45:27 sometimes we use the promising graphical model sometimes you use a knowledge trough where some of the things that has
00:45:34 tremendous industry impact but the amount of chat about knowledge drops in academia has really thin compared to the
00:45:40 actual rower impact so so I think reinforcement learning should be in that portfolio and then it's about balancing
00:45:45 how much we teach all of these things and the world the world should have diverse skills if he said if you know
00:45:51 everyone just learn one one narrow thing yeah the diverse skill help you discover the right tool for the job what is the
00:45:57 most beautiful surprising or inspiring idea in deep learning to you something that captivated your imagination
00:46:07 at the scale that could be a the performance I give you achieve of scale or there are other ideas I think that if
00:46:15 my only job was being an academic researcher and have an unlimited budget and you know didn't have to worry about
00:46:22 short-term impact and only focus on long term in fact I pretty spent all my time doing research on unsupervised learning
00:46:29 I still think unsupervised learning is a beautiful idea at both this Pastner herbs and I CML I was attending
00:46:37 workshops on the center Vera's talks about self supervised learning which is one vertical segment maybe of sort of
00:46:44 unsupervised learning I'm excited about maybe just to summarize the idea I guess you know the idea of describe movie no
00:46:50 please so here's the examples self supervised learning let's say we grab a lot of unlabeled images off the internet
00:46:57 so with infinite amounts of this type of data I'm going to take each image and rotate it by a random multiple of 90
00:47:04 degrees and then I'm going to train a supervised near Network to predict what was the original orientation so has
00:47:11 something rotated 90 degrees hundred eighty degrees turns in seven degrees or zero degrees so you can generate an
00:47:17 infinite amount of label data because you rotate to the image so you know what's the branch of label and so
00:47:24 various researchers have found that by taking unlabeled data and making up label datasets and training a large
00:47:31 neural network on these thoughts you can then take the hidden layer representation and transfer to a
00:47:37 different toss very powerfully learning word embeddings when we take a sentence to leave the word predict the
00:47:43 missing word which is how we learn you know one of the ways we learn where the embeddings is another example and I
00:47:50 think there's now this portfolio of techniques for generating these made-up toss another one called jigsaw what
00:47:58 behave you take an image cut it up into a you know three by three grid so like a nine 3x3 puzzle piece jump out the nine
00:48:04 pieces and have a neural network predict which of the nine factorial possible permutations it came from so are many
00:48:14 groups including your opening I Peter P has been doing some work on this to Facebook Google brain I think deep mind Oh Aaron
00:48:23 menthols has great work on the CPC objective so many teams are doing exciting work and I think this is a way
00:48:30 to generate infinitely both data and and I find this a very exciting piece of an supervisor and he's a long-term you
00:48:37 think that's going to unlock a lot of power and in machine learning systems is this kind of unsupervised learning I
00:48:43 don't think there's the whole enchilada I think that's just a piece of it and I think this one piece unsuited is self
00:48:49 supervised learning it's starting to get traction we're very close to it being useful well what embedding is really
00:48:56 really useful I think we're getting closer and closer to just having a significant real world impact maybe in
00:49:03 computer vision and video but I think this concept and then I think there'll be other concepts around it you know
00:49:09 other unsupervised learning things that I worked on I've been excited about I was really excited about sparse coding
00:49:17 and I see a slow feature analysis I think all of these are ideas that various of us were working on about a
00:49:22 decade ago before we all got distracted by how well supervised learning was wearing work yeah it was a we would
00:49:28 return we were returned to the fundamentals of representation learning that that really started this movement
00:49:34 of deep learning I think there's a lot more work that one could explore around the steam of ideas and other ideas to
00:49:41 come or better algorithms so if we could return to maybe talk quickly about the specifics of deep learning that AI the
00:49:49 deep learning specialization perhaps how long does it take to complete the course would you say the official length of the
00:49:56 divine specialization is I think 16 weeks so about 4 months but is go at your own pace so if you subscribe to the
00:50:04 divine socialization there are people that finish that in less than a month by working more intensely and study more
00:50:09 intensely so it really depends on on the individual who created the divine specialization we wanted to make it very
00:50:18 accessible and very affordable and with you know Coursera and Devon dyers education mission one thing that's
00:50:24 really important to me is that if there's someone for whom paying anything is a it's a financial hardship then just
00:50:30 apply for financial and get it for free if you were to recommend a daily schedule for people in
00:50:39 learning whether it's through the deep learning that a a specialization or just learning in the world of deep learning
00:50:47 what would you recommend how do they go about day two days or a specific advice about learning about their journey in
00:50:54 the world of deep learning machine learning I think I'm getting the habit of learning is key and that means
00:51:05 regularity so for example we send out our weekly newsletter the batch every Wednesday so people know is coming
00:51:10 Wednesday you can spend a little bit of time on Wednesday catching up on the latest news through the batch on the on
00:51:18 on on Wednesday and for myself I've picked up a habit of spending some time every Saturday and every Sunday reading
00:51:26 or studying and so I don't wake up on the Saturday and have to make a decision do I feel like reading or studying today
00:51:31 or not it's just it's just what I do and the fact is a habit makes it easier so I think if someone can get in that habit
00:51:39 it's like you know just like we brush our teeth every morning I don't think about it if I thought about this a
00:51:44 little bit annoying to have to spend two minutes doing that but it's a habit that it takes no cognitive loads but this
00:51:50 would be so much harder if we have to make a decision every morning so and actually that's the reason why we're the
00:51:56 same thing every day as well it's just one less decision I just get out in there where I'm sure so I think you can
00:52:02 get that habit that consistency of studying then then it actually feels easier so yeah it's kind of amazing in
00:52:11 my own life like I play guitar every day for life forced myself to at least for five minutes play guitar it's just it's
00:52:18 a ridiculously short period of time but because I've gotten into that habit it's incredible what you can accomplish in a
00:52:24 period of a year or two years you could become you know exceptionally good at certain aspects of
00:52:31 a thing by just doing it every day for a very short period of time it's kind of a miracle that that is how it works
00:52:37 it's adds up over time yeah and I think is this something is often not about the bursts of sustained effort and all-night
00:52:43 is because you can only do that in a limited of times it's the sustained effort over a long time I think you know reading two
00:52:51 research papers there's a nice thing to do but the power is not reading through research papers this reading through
00:52:57 research papers a week for a year then you've read a hundred papers and and you actually learn a lot when you read a
00:53:04 hundred papers so regularity and making learning a habit do you have do you have general other study tips for
00:53:13 particularly deep learning that people should in in their process of learning is there some kind of recommendations or
00:53:21 tips you have as they learn one thing I still do when I'm trying to study something really deeply is take
00:53:27 handwritten notes in theories I know there are a lot of people that take the deep learning courses during the
00:53:33 commutes or something where maybe mobile quit to take notes so I know it's may not work for everyone but when I'm
00:53:40 taking courses on Coursera you know and that still takes on my every now and then the most recent I took was a was a
00:53:45 course on clinical trials because those engines of all that I got my little moleskin notebook and I was sitting in
00:53:51 my desk is just taking down notes so what the instructor was saying and that Act we know that that act of taking
00:53:57 notes preferably handwritten notes increases retention so as you're sort of watching the video just kind of pausing
00:54:06 maybe and then taking the basic insights down on paper yeah so I should have been a few studies if you know search online
00:54:13 you find for some of these studies that taking handwritten notes because handwriting is slower as were saying
00:54:20 just now it causes you to recoat the knowledge in your own words more and that process of recoding promotes
00:54:27 long-term attention this is as opposed to typing which is fine again typing is better than nothing
00:54:32 or in taking across and nautical is better than nothing any cause law but comparing handwritten notes and typing
00:54:39 you can usually type faster for a lot of people do you can hand write notes and so when people type they're more
00:54:45 likely to transcribe verbatim what they heard and that reduces the amount of recoding and that actually results in
00:54:52 less long-term retention I don't know what the psychological effect there is but so true there's something
00:54:57 fundamentally different about in handwriting I wonder what that is I wonder if it is as simple as just the
00:55:03 time it takes to write it slower yeah and and and because because you can't write as many words you have to
00:55:10 take whatever they said and summarize it into fewer words and that summarization process requires deeper processing of
00:55:17 the meaning which then results in better attention that's fascinating oh and then I spent I think yeah because of course
00:55:23 error I spent so much time studying pedagogy thank you my passion that I really love learning how to more
00:55:30 efficiently help others learn yeah one of the things I do both in creating videos or when we write the batch is um
00:55:38 I kind of think is one minute spent of us going to be a more efficient learning experience than one minute spent
00:55:46 anywhere else and we really try to you know make a time efficient for the learning it's good to know everyone's
00:55:51 busy so when when we're editing them I often tell my teams everywhere it needs to fight for his life and if can delete
00:55:57 it where this is the lead to that not wait that's not waste than during this time wow that's so it's so amazing that
00:56:02 you think that way because there is millions of people that are impacted by your teaching and sort of that one
00:56:07 minute spent has a ripple effect right three years of time which is just fascinating talk about how does one make
00:56:15 a career out of an interest in deep learning give advice for people we just talked about sort of the beginning early
00:56:22 steps but if you want to make it a entire life's journey or at least a journey of a decade or two how did it
00:56:29 how do you do it so most important thing is to get started right and ever I think in the early part of a career coursework
00:56:38 like the divine specialization or it's a very efficient way to master this material so because you know instructors
00:56:49 be me or someone else or you know Laurence Moroney teaches our tensor field specialization and other things
00:56:55 we're working on spend effort to try to make a time efficient for you to learn new concepts of coursework because
00:57:01 actually a very efficient way for people that learn concepts and the beginning parts of break into new fields in fact
00:57:08 one thing I see at Stanford some of my PhD students want to jump in the research right away and actually
00:57:14 tend to say look when you first copy yours the piece didn't spend time ticking causes because it lays the
00:57:19 foundation it's fine if you're less productive in your first couple of years you'd be better off in the long term
00:57:25 beyond a certain point there's materials that doesn't exist in courses because it's too cutting edge the
00:57:30 courses we created yeah there's some practical experience that we're not yet that good as teaching in a in a course
00:57:36 and I think after exhausting the efficient course were then most people need to go on to either ideally work on
00:57:46 projects and then maybe also continue their learning by reading blog polls and research papers and thing like that
00:57:52 doing practice is really important and again I think is important to start small it's just do something today you
00:58:00 read about deep learning if you like all these people doing such exciting things whatever I'm not building a neural
00:58:04 network they change the world and what's the point well the point is sometimes building that time in your network you
00:58:10 know be it m-miss or upgrade to a fashion amnesty whatever it's doing your own fun hobby project that's how you
00:58:17 gain the skills to let you do bigger and bigger projects I find this to be true at the individual level and also at the
00:58:24 organizational level for company to become good at machine learning sometimes the right thing to do is not
00:58:30 to tackle the giant project is instead to do the small project that lets the organization learn and then build up
00:58:35 from there but this triple for individuals and and and for and for companies just taking
00:58:43 the first step and then taking small steps it's the key should students pursue a PhD do you think you can do so
00:58:50 much that's the one of the fascinating things in machine learning you can have so much impact without ever getting a
00:58:56 PhD so what are your thoughts should people go to grad school should people get a PhD I think that there are
00:59:03 multiple good options of which doing a PhD could be one of them I think that if someone's admitted to top ph.d program
00:59:12 you know that MIT Stanford top schools I think that's a very good experience or someone gets a job at a top organization
00:59:21 at the top a I team I think that's also good experience there are some things you still need a PhD to do if someone's
00:59:28 aspiration is to be a professor here at the top academic University you just need a PhD to do that but if it goes to
00:59:33 you know start a complete build a complete do great technical work I think PhD is a good experience but I would
00:59:40 look at the different options available to someone you know where the places where you can get a job where the place
00:59:45 isn't getting a PhD program and kind of weigh the pros and cons of those so just to linger on that for a little bit
00:59:51 longer what final dreams and goals do you think people should have so the what options for they explore so you can work
01:00:01 in industry so for a large company like Google Facebook buy do all these large companies already have huge teams of
01:00:09 machine learning engineers you can also do with an industry sort of more research groups that kind of like Google
01:00:15 research Google brain that you can also do like we say the professor neck as in academia and what else oh you can still
01:00:24 build your own company you can do a start-up is there anything that stands out between those options or are they
01:00:30 all beautiful different journeys that people should consider I think the thing that affects your experience more is
01:00:37 less are you in discomfort versus that company your academia versus industry I think the thing that affects to
01:00:42 experience Moses who are the people you're interacting with you know in the daily basis so even if you look at some
01:00:50 of the large companies the experience of individuals and different teams is very different and what matters most is not
01:00:56 the logo above the door when you walk into the giant building every day what matters the most is who are the 10
01:01:01 people who are the 30 people you interact with every day so I actually tend to advise people if
01:01:07 you get a job from from a company also who is your manager who are your peers who are you actually going to talk to
01:01:12 you we're all social creatures we tend to you know become more like the people around us and if you're working with
01:01:19 great people you will learn faster or if you get admitted if you get a job at a great company or a great university
01:01:26 maybe the logo you walk in you know is great but you're actually stuck on some team doing really worth it doesn't
01:01:32 excite you and then that's actually really bad experience so this is true both universities and for large companies for
01:01:39 small companies you can kind of figure out who you be working quite quickly and I tend to advise people if a company
01:01:46 refuses to tell you who you work with someone say oh join us the rotation system will figure out I think that that
01:01:52 that's a worrying answer because it because it means you may not get sense - you mean not actually get to team with
01:02:00 with great peers and great people to work with it's actually a really profound advice that we kind of
01:02:06 sometimes sweep we don't consider to rigorously or carefully the people around you are really often this
01:02:12 especially when you accomplish great things it seems the great things are accomplished because of the people
01:02:18 around you so that that's a it's not about the the worry whether you learn this thing or that thing or like you
01:02:25 said the logo that's hangs up top it's the people that's a fascinating and it's such a hard search process of finding
01:02:34 just like finding the right friends and somebody to get married with and that kind of thing it's a very hard search
01:02:41 process a people search problem yeah but I think when someone interviews you know at a university or the research lab at a
01:02:48 large corporation it's good to insist on just asking who are the people who is my manager and if you refuse to tell me I'm
01:02:54 gonna think well maybe that's because you don't have a good answer it may not be someone I like
01:02:59 and if you don't particularly connect if something feels off for the people then don't stick to it you know that's a
01:03:08 really important signal to consider yeah and that's yeah I am in my standard cause cs2 30s was an ACN talk I think I
01:03:17 gave like a hour long talk on career advice including on the job search process and then some of these those are
01:03:23 yours if you can find those videos on also and others I'll point people to them beautiful so the AI fund helps ai
01:03:34 startups get off the ground or perhaps you can elaborate all the fun things it's evolved with what's your advice and
01:03:39 how does one build a successful hey I start up you know in second Valley a lot of starter failures come from building
01:03:48 our products that no one wanted so when you know cool technology but who's gonna use it so I think I tend to
01:03:58 be very outcome driven and then customer obsess ultimately we don't get to vote if we succeed or fail is only
01:04:07 the customer that the only one that gets a thumbs up or thumbs down those in the long term in the short term you know
01:04:12 there are various people who get various votes but in the long term that's what really matters so as you build to start
01:04:21 where to cast as the question well the customer gives a thought and give a thumbs up on this I think so I think
01:04:27 startups that are very customer focused customer says deeply understand the customer and are oriented to serve the
01:04:36 customer are more likely to succeed with the provision that I think all of us should only do things that we think
01:04:41 create social good and lose the world for words I'm sorry I personally don't want to build addictive digital products
01:04:48 just so long as you know the things that that could be lucrative but I won't do but if we can find ways to serve people
01:04:56 in meaningful ways I think those can be those can be great things to do either the academic setting or in a corporate
01:05:03 setting real startup setting so can you give me the idea of why you started the AI fund I remember when I was leaving
01:05:15 the AI group at Baidu I had two jobs two parts of my job one was to build an AI engine to support the existing
01:05:20 businesses and that wasn't running you know just read this performed by itself the second part of my job at the time
01:05:25 which was to try to systematically initiate new lines of businesses using the company's aiq abilities so you know
01:05:33 the self-driving car team came out my group the spot speaker team similar to what is some amazonica a
01:05:41 lexer in the US but we announced it before Amazon did so we were goodbye to wasn't following him wasn't following an
01:05:48 Amazon that that came out of my group and I found that to be actually that the most fun part of my job so what I
01:05:56 what to do was to build AI fund as a startup studio to systematically create new startup firms
01:06:04 with all the things we can now do of AI I think the ability to build new teams to go after this rich space of
01:06:11 opportunities is a very important way to very important mechanism to get these projects done that I think will move the
01:06:17 world forward so of unfortunate that don't the few teams that had a meaningful positive impact and I felt
01:06:25 that we might present do this in the most systematic repeatable way so a start-up studio is a relatively new
01:06:32 concept there there are maybe dozens of startup studios you're right now but I feel like all of us many teams are still
01:06:41 trying to figure out how do you systematically build companies with a high success rate so I think even though
01:06:49 my you know venture capital friends are seem to be more and more building companies rather than investing
01:06:54 companies but I find a fascinating thing to do to figure out the mechanisms by which we could systematically build
01:07:00 successful teams successful businesses in in areas that we find meaningful so startup studio is something is is a
01:07:09 place and a mechanism for startups to go from zero to success so try to develop a blueprint it's actually a place for us
01:07:16 to build startups from scratch so we often bring in found this and work with them or maybe even have existing ideas
01:07:26 that we match founders with and then this launches yo hopefully into successful companies so how close are
01:07:35 you to figuring out a way to automate the process of starting from scratch and building successful AI startup yeah I
01:07:43 think we've we've been constantly improving and iterating on our processes but how we do that so things like you
01:07:50 know how many customer calls do we need to make and all they get customer validation how do we make sure this
01:07:55 technology can be built well all of our businesses need cutting-edge machine learning algorithms
01:08:00 so you know kind of Alrosa develop in the last one or two years and even if it works in a research paper it turns out
01:08:07 taking the production it's really hard a lot of issues for making these things work in the real life didn't know why
01:08:14 the actress in academia so how do you validate is actually doable how do you build a team get the specialize domain knowledge
01:08:21 speed in education or healthcare or whatever staffing are focusing on so I think we're actually getting we've been
01:08:28 getting much better at giving the entrepreneurs a high success rate but I think we're still I think the whole
01:08:34 world is still in the early phases freaking us out but do you think there is some aspects of that process the
01:08:41 transferable from one startup to another to another to another yeah very much so you know starting a company to most
01:08:49 entrepreneurs is is a really lonely thing and I've seen so many entrepreneurs not know how to make a
01:08:57 certain decision like when do you need - how do you do PDP sales right if you don't know that this is really hard or
01:09:05 how do you market this efficiently other than you're buying ads which is really expensive other more efficient tactics that know
01:09:12 from machine learning project you know basic decisions can change the course of whether machine learning product works
01:09:20 or not and so there are so many hundreds of decisions that entrepreneurs need to make and making a mistake in a couple of
01:09:27 key decisions can have a huge impact on the fate of the company so I think a starter studio provides a support
01:09:34 structure that makes starting a company much less of a lonely experience and also when facing with these key
01:09:42 decisions like trying to hire your first the VP of Engineering what's a good selection criteria do you sauce should I
01:09:49 hire this person or not but helping by having by having an ecosystem around the entrepreneurs the founders to hope I
01:09:57 think we help them at the key moments and hopefully cyclically make them more enjoyable and in higher
01:10:03 success rate there's somebody to brainstorm with in these very difficult decision points and also to help then
01:10:12 recognize what they may not even realize is a key decision point right that's that's the first probably the most
01:10:19 important part yeah you can say one other thing you know I think the building companies is one thing but I
01:10:27 feel like is really important that we build companies move the world forward for example
01:10:34 Lavinia funteam does once an idea for a new company that if it had succeeded but have resulted in people watching a lot
01:10:41 more videos in a certain narrow vertical type of video looked at it the business case was fine the revenue case was fine
01:10:48 but a look that I just said I don't want to do this that you know I don't actually just want to have a lot more
01:10:54 people watch this type of video wasn't educational is the educational Haiti and so and so III code the idea on the basis
01:11:01 that didn't think it would actually help people so what the building companies or work of enterprises or doing personal
01:11:10 projects I think it's up to each of us to figure out what's the difference we want to make in the world with learning
01:11:16 AI you helped already established companies grow their AI and machine learning efforts how does a large
01:11:23 company integrate machine learning into their efforts AI is a general purpose technology and I think it will transform
01:11:31 every industry our community has already transformed the logic center software internet sector most software internet
01:11:38 companies outside the top right five or six or three or four already have reasonable machine learning capabilities
01:11:44 or or getting there is still room for improvement but when I look outside the software internet sector everything from
01:11:52 manufacturing agriculture healthcare they're just X translation there's so many opportunities that very few people
01:11:58 are working on so I think the next way for AI is first also transform all of those other industries there was a
01:12:06 McKinsey study estimating 13 trillion dollars of global economic growth the u.s. GDP is 19 trillion dollars or
01:12:13 thirteen trillion this is a big number or PwC it's been 16 trillion dollars so whatever number is this large but the
01:12:20 interesting thing to me was a lot of that impact would be outside the software internet sector so we need more
01:12:28 teams to work with these companies to help them adopt AI and I think this is one things that make you hope drive
01:12:35 global economic growth and make humanity more powerful and like you said the impact is there so what are the best
01:12:40 industries the biggest industries where AI can perhaps outside the software tech sector
01:12:48 frankly I think is all of them some of the ones I'm spending a lot of time on are manufacturing agriculture looking
01:12:55 to healthcare for example in manufacturing we do a lot of our work in visual inspection where today there are
01:13:01 people standing around using the AI humanoid to check it you know this plastic part or the smartphone or this
01:13:08 thing has a stretch or gentle something in it we can use a camera to take a picture use a algorithm deep learning
01:13:16 and other things to check if it's defective or not and does our factories improve you then improve quality and
01:13:24 improve throughput it turns out the practical problems we run into are very different than the ones you might read
01:13:29 about in most research papers the data says they're really small so if a small D the problems you're the factories keep
01:13:36 on changing the environment so it works well on your test set but guess what you know the something changes in the
01:13:43 factory the lights go on they're off recently we there was a factory in which M burned through through the factory and
01:13:49 pooped on something and so that you know so that changed stuff and so increasing our algorithm of making robustness so
01:13:56 all the changes happen the factory I find that we runs a lot of practical problems that that are not as widely
01:14:03 discussed in in academia and is really fun kind of being on the cutting edge solving these problems before you know
01:14:09 maybe before many people are even aware that there is a problem there and that's such a fascinating space you're
01:14:14 absolutely right but what is the first step that a company should take it's just scary leap into this new world of
01:14:23 going from the human eye inspecting to digitizing that process having a camera having an algorithm what's the first
01:14:30 step like what's the early journey that you recommend that you see these companies taking I published a document
01:14:36 called the AI transformation playbook that's online and talk briefly if everyone course on Coursera about the
01:14:43 long term journey that companies should take but the first step is actually to start small I've seen lot more companies
01:14:50 fail by starting to bake than by starting to small take even Google you know most people
01:14:57 realize how hard it was and how controversial was in the early days so when it's not the Google brain it was controversial
01:15:05 you know people thought deep-learning Nunez tried it didn't work why would you want to do deep learning
01:15:11 so my first internal customer rule in Google was the Google speech team which is not the most lucrative project in
01:15:18 Google but not the most important it's not web search or advertising but by starting small on my team helped the
01:15:26 speech team build a more accurate speech recognition system and this caused their peers other teams to start at more faith
01:15:33 and deep learning my second internal customer was the Google Maps team where we use computer vision to read house
01:15:40 numbers from basic Street view images the more accurately locate houses within Google Maps so improve the quality later
01:15:47 and there's only after those two successes that I then started the most serious conversation with a Google Ads
01:15:54 team and so there's a ripple effect that you showed that it works in these in this cases and then it just propagates
01:15:59 through the entire company that this this thing has a lot of value and use for us I think the early small-scale
01:16:07 projects it helps the teams gain faith but also hosts the team's learn what these technologies do I still remember
01:16:14 when our first GPU server it was a server under some guys desk and you know and and then that taught us early
01:16:22 important lessons about how do you have multiple users share a set of GPUs which is really non-obvious at the time but
01:16:29 those early lessons were important we learned a lot from that first GPU server then later helped the teams think
01:16:35 through how to scale without too much large deployments are there concrete challenges that companies face that the
01:16:43 UC is important for them to solve I think building and deploying machine learning systems is hard there's a huge
01:16:49 gulf between something that works and I drew the notebook on your laptop versus something runs their production
01:16:55 deployment setting in a factory or culture plant or whatever so I see a lot of people you know get something to
01:17:01 work on your laptop you say wow look without done and that's that's that's great that's hot that's a very important
01:17:07 first step but all teams underestimate the rest of the steps so for example I've heard this exact
01:17:13 same conversation between a lot of machine learning people and businesspeople the machine learning person says look my
01:17:20 algorithm does well on the test set and the clean test said I didn't a peak and then machine and the business person
01:17:27 says thank you very much but your algorithm sucks it doesn't work and the machine learning person says no wait I
01:17:34 did well on the test set and I think there is a gulf between what it takes to do well on a test set on your hard drive
01:17:43 versus what it takes to work well in a deployment setting some some common problems robustus in generalization you
01:17:50 know yuuta for something the factory maybe they chopped down a tree outside the factory so the tree no longer covers
01:17:56 the window and the lighting is different so the first set changes and in machine learning and especially in academia we
01:18:03 don't know how to deal with test set distributions that are dramatically different than the training set
01:18:08 distribution this research there's stuff like domain annotation transfer learning you know that the people working on it
01:18:15 but we're really not good at this so how do you actually get this to work because your test set distribution is
01:18:24 going to change and I think also if you look at the number of lines of code in a software system the machine
01:18:29 learning model it's maybe five percent or even fewer relative to the entire software system we need to build so how
01:18:37 to get all that work done and make it reliable and systematic a good software engineering work is fundamental here to
01:18:45 building a successful small machine learning system yes and and and the software system needs to interface with
01:18:51 people's work clothes so machine learning is automation on steroids if we take one task all the many tasks
01:18:57 that done in factories so in factory does lots of things one tosses visual inspection if we automate that one task
01:19:04 it can be really valuable but you may need to redesign a lot of other tasks around that one task for example say the
01:19:10 machine learning algorithm says this is defective what is supposed to do is you throw the way to get a human to double
01:19:16 check do you want to rework it or fix it so you need to redesign a lot of toss around that thing you've now automated so
01:19:23 planning for the change management and making sure that the software he write is consistent with the new work though
01:19:28 and you take the time to explain to people when he so happens I think what Lani AI has become good at and I think
01:19:37 we learned by making mistakes and you know painful experiences for my ring what would become good at is working
01:19:44 with our partners to think through all the things beyond just the machine learning model don't you put a notebook
01:19:52 but build the entire system manage the change process and figure out how to deploy this in a way that has an actual
01:19:58 impact the processes that the large software tech companies use for deploying don't work for a lot of other
01:20:04 scenarios there for example when I was leading you know large speech teams if the speech my vision system goes down
01:20:11 what happens what allowance goes off and then someone like me will say hey you 20 engineers please fix this baby with an
01:20:18 American but if you have a system garden in the factory there are not 20 machine learning engineers sitting around you
01:20:23 can page the duty and have them fix it so how do you deal with the maintenance or the or the DevOps or the mo ops or
01:20:31 the other aspects of this so these are concepts that I think landing AI and a few other teams on the cutting edge 
01:20:38 but we don't even have systematic terminology yet to describe some of the stuff we do because I think we're we're
01:20:45 indenting it on the fly so you mentioned some people are interested in discovering mathematical beauty and
01:20:50 truth in the universe and you're interested in having big positive impact in the world so let me ask the two are
01:20:58 not inconsistent no they're all together I'm only half joking because you're probably interested a little bit in both
01:21:06 but let me ask a romanticized question so much of the work your work and our discussion today has been on the applied
01:21:13 AI maybe you can even call narrow AI where the goal is to create systems that automate some specific process that adds
01:21:20 a lot of value to the world but there's another branch of AI starting with Alan Turing the kind of dreams of creating
01:21:26 human level or superhuman level intelligence is this something you dream of as well do you think we human beings
01:21:34 will ever build a human level they're superhuman level intelligent system I would love to get the AGI and I
01:21:41 think humanity will but whether it takes a hundred years or 500 or 5,000 I find hard to estimate do you have some folks
01:21:52 have worries about the different trajectories that path would take even existential threats of an AGI system do
01:22:00 you have such concerns whether in the short term or the long term I do worry about the long term fate of humanity um
01:22:10 I do wonder as well I do worry about overpopulation on the planet Mars just not today
01:22:16 I think there will be a day when maybe maybe someday in the future mass will be polluted there are these children dying
01:22:22 and some will look back at this video and say Andrew how is Anja so heartless you didn't care about all these children
01:22:29 dying on the planet Mars and I apologize to the future viewer I do care about the children but I just don't know how to
01:22:35 productively work on that today your picture will be in the dictionary for the people who are ignorant about the
01:22:43 overpopulation on Mars okay yes so it's a long term problem is there something in the short term we should be thinking
01:22:49 about in terms of aligning the values of our AI systems with the values of us humans sort of something this to Russell
01:22:58 and other folks are thinking about as this system develops more and more we want to make sure that it represents the
01:23:04 better angels of our nature the ethics the values of our society you know if you take so driving cars the
01:23:14 biggest problem with self-driving cars is not that there's some trolley dilemma and you teach this so you know how many
01:23:22 times when you're driving your car did you face this moral dilemma as it would I food I crash into you so I think
01:23:28 itself Giancarlo runs that problem roughly as often as we do when we drive our cars the biggest problem Sir John
01:23:34 calls is when there's a big white truck across the road and what you should do is break and not crash into it and the
01:23:41 search on car fails and it crashes into it so I think we need to solve that problem for us I think the problem with
01:23:46 some of these discussions about a gi you know alignments the paperclip problem is that is a huge distraction
01:23:56 from the much harder problems that we actually need to address today some hard problems yesterday
01:24:03 I think I'm bias is a huge issue I worry about wealth inequality the AI and Internet are causing an acceleration of
01:24:11 concentration of power because we can now centralized data use there to process it and so industry after
01:24:16 industry we've affected every industry so the internet industry has a lot of winner-take- modes are willing to take
01:24:23 all dynamics but if infected all these other industries so also giving these other industries when they take most I'm
01:24:29 going to take all flavors so look at what uber and lyft into the taxi industry so we're doing this type of
01:24:35 things along so this so creating tremendous wealth but how do we shoulder the wealth is fairly shared I think that
01:24:43 and then how do we help people whose jobs are displace you know I think education is part of it there may be
01:24:49 even more that we need to do then education I think bias is a serious issue there adverse users of AI and like
01:24:59 deep fakes being used for various nefarious purposes so I worry about some teams maybe accidentally and I hope not
01:25:09 deliberately making a lot of noise about things that problems in the distant future rather than focusing on senses
01:25:15 much harder problems yeah the overshadow the problems that we have already today they're exceptionally
01:25:21 challenging like those you said and even the silly ones but the ones that have a huge impact which is the lighting
01:25:27 variation outside of your factory window that that ultimately is what makes the difference between like you said the
01:25:33 jupiter notebook and something that actually transforms an entire industry potentially yeah and I think and then
01:25:41 just to some companies when a regulator comes to you and says no your product is messing things up fixing it may have a
01:25:49 revenue impact was much more fun to talk to them about how you promise not to wipe out humanity in this interface
01:25:54 they're actually really hard problems we face so your life has been a great journey from teaching to research to entrepreneurship
01:26:03 two questions one are there regrets moments that if you went back you would do differently and two are there moments
01:26:11 you're especially proud of moments that made you truly happy you know I've made so many mistakes it feels like every
01:26:22 time I discover something I go why didn't I think of this you know five years earlier or even ten years earlier
01:26:31 and Reese's and then sometimes I read a book and I go I wish I read this book ten years ago my life we've been so
01:26:37 different although that happened recently and then I was thinking if only I read this book when we're a start-up Coursera
01:26:44 could have been so much better but I discovered that book had not yet been written we're starting Coursera so that
01:26:51 means even but I find that the process of discovery we keep on finding out things that seem so obvious in hindsight
01:26:59 but it always takes us so much longer than then I wish to figure it out so on the second question are there moments in
01:27:10 your life that if you look back that you're especially proud of or especially happy the that fills you with happiness
01:27:19 and fulfillment well two answers one despite all turnover yes of course you say no matter how much time I spend for
01:27:25 I just can't spend enough time with her congratulations weather thank you and then second is helping other people I
01:27:31 think to me I think the meaning of life is helping others achieve whatever are their dreams and then also to try to
01:27:40 move the world forward by making humanity more powerful as a whole so the times that I felt most happy most proud
01:27:50 works when I felt someone else allowed me the good fortune of helping them a little bit on the path to their
01:27:58 dreams I think there's no better way to end it than talking about happiness and the meaning of life so enter it's a huge
