00:00:01 the following is a conversation with lisa feldman barrett a professor of psychology at
00:00:06 northeastern university and one of the most brilliant and bold thinkers and scientists i've ever had
00:00:12 the pleasure of speaking with she is the author of a book that revolutionized our understanding of
00:00:17 emotion in the brain called how emotions are made and she's coming out
00:00:23 with a new book called seven and a half lessons about the brain that you can and should pre-order now
00:00:31 i got a chance to read it already and it's one of the best short whirlwind introductions to the
00:00:36 human brain i've ever read it comes out on november 17th but again if there's anybody worth supporting it's
00:00:42 lisa so please do pre-order the book now lisa and i agreed to speak once again
00:00:48 around the time of the book release especially because we felt that this first conversation is good to release
00:00:54 now since we talk about the divisive time we're living through in the united states leading up to the election and she gives
00:01:02 me a whole new way to think about it from a neuroscience perspective that is ultimately inspiring of empathy compassion
00:01:11 and love quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts related to this episode
00:01:16 first sponsor is athletic greens the all-in-one drink that i start every day with to cover all my nutritional bases that i
00:01:23 don't otherwise get through my diet naturally second is magic spoon low carb keto friendly delicious cereal that i reward
00:01:30 myself with after a productive day the cocoa flavor is my favorite
00:01:36 third sponsor is cash app the app i use to send money to friends for food drinks and unfortunately for
00:01:43 the many bets i have lost to them please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and
00:01:50 to support this podcast as a side note let me say that the bold first principles way that lisa
00:01:56 approaches her study of the brain is something that has inspired me ever since i learned about her work
00:02:02 and in fact i invited her to speak at the agi series i organized at mit several years ago
00:02:08 but as a little twist instead of a lecture we did a conversation in front of the class
00:02:13 i think that was one of the early moments that led me to start this very podcast it was scary and gratifying
00:02:21 which is exactly what life is all about and it's kind of funny how life turns a little moments like these
00:02:27 that at the time don't seem to be anything out of the ordinary if you enjoy this thing subscribe on youtube
00:02:32 review it with five stars and apple podcast follow on spotify support on patreon or connect with me on
00:02:38 twitter at lex friedman and now here's my conversation with lisa feldman barrett since we'll
00:02:48 talk a lot about the brain today do you think let's ask the craziest question do you think there is other intelligent life
00:02:52 out there in the universe honestly i've been asking myself lately if there's intelligent
00:02:59 life on this planet  you know i ha i i have to think probabilities suggest yes and
00:03:08 also secretly i think i just hope that's true it would be really i know scientists aren't supposed to have hopes and dreams but
00:03:17  i i think it would be really cool and i also think it would be really sad if it if it
00:03:22 wasn't the case if we really were alone that would be profoundly sad i think so it's exciting
00:03:32 to you not scary yeah no you know i take a lot of comfort and curiosity
00:03:41 it's a great it's a great resource for dealing with  stress so i'm learning all about mushrooms and
00:03:51  octopuses and you know all kinds of stuff and so for me this counts i think in the realm of awe but also i think i'm
00:03:58 somebody who cultivates awe deliberately on purpose to feel like a speck
00:04:06 you know i i find it a relief occasionally it feels small to feel small in a profoundly large and interesting universe
00:04:17 so maybe to dig more technically on the question of intelligence do you think it's difficult for intelligent
00:04:23 life to arise like it did on earth from everything you've written and studied about the brain
00:04:30 how magical of a thing is it in terms of the odds it takes to arise yeah so you know magic is just
00:04:41 don't get me wrong i mean i like i like a magic shirt as much as the next person my husband was a magician at one time but
00:04:48 you know magic is just a bunch of stuff that we don't really understand how it works yet so i would say from what i understand
00:04:56 there are some major steps in the course of evolution that at the beginning of life the step from single cell to
00:05:04 multicellular organisms things like that which are really not known i think for me the
00:05:16 could it you know what's the likelihood that it would happen again what are the steps and how long would it
00:05:26 take and if it were to happen again on earth would would we end up with the same you know menu of life forms that we
00:05:34 currently have now and i think the answer is probably no right there's just so much about
00:05:41 evolution that is stochastic and driven by chance but the question is whether that menu would be equally delicious
00:05:48 meaning like there'd be rich complexity of the kind of like would we get dolphins and humans or
00:05:55 whoever else falls in that category of weirdly intelligent seemingly intelligent however we define that
00:06:03 well i think that has to be true if you just look at the range of creatures who've gone extinct
00:06:09 i mean but if you look at the range of creatures that are on the earth now it's incredible and you know it's sort of tried to say
00:06:16 that but it actually is really incredible particularly i don't know i mean animals there are animals that seem
00:06:26 really ordinary until you watch them closely and then they become miraculous you know like
00:06:30 certain types of birds which do very miraculous things  build you know bowers and do dances
00:06:40 and all these really funky things that are hard to explain  with a standard evolutionary story although
00:06:46 you know people have them birds are weird they do a lot of for mating purposes they they have a concept of beauty
00:06:54 i haven't quite maybe you know much better but it doesn't seem to fit evolutionary arguments well it does fit
00:07:00 well it depends right so i think you're talking about the evolution of beauty the um
00:07:06 book that was written recently by was it from without his name richard from i think no i didn't oh it's a great book it's
00:07:14 very controversial though because he is argues make an argument that the the question about birds and some
00:07:21 other animals is why would they engage in such metabolically costly displays when it doesn't improve
00:07:29 their fitness at all and the answer that he gives is the answer that darwin gave
00:07:37 which is sexual selection not natural selection but you know selection can occur for all kinds of
00:07:41 reasons there could be artificial selection which is when we breed animals right which is actually
00:07:47 how darwin that that observation helped darwin come to the idea of natural selection oh interesting and then there's
00:07:53 sexual selection meaning and the argument that that i think his name is from
00:08:02  makes is that that it's the pleasure the selection pressure is the pleasure of female birds
00:08:09 which as a woman and as someone who studies affect that's a great answer i actually think there probably
00:08:15 is natural i think there is an aspect of natural selection to it which he maybe hasn't considered
00:08:20 but you were saying the reason we brought up birds is the the life we got now seems to be quite
00:08:25 yeah so you peek into the ocean peek into the sky there are miraculous creatures
00:08:31 look at creatures who've gone extinct and you know in science fiction  stories you couldn't dream up something as
00:08:40 interesting so my guess is that you know intelligent life evolves in in many different ways even on this
00:08:48 planet  there isn't one form of intelligence there's not one brain that gives you intelligence
00:08:52 there are lots of different brain structures that can give you intelligence so my guess is that the
00:09:00 menagerie might not look exactly the way that it looks now but it would certainly be as as interesting but if we look at
00:09:09 the human brain versus the brains or whatever you call them the mechanisms of intelligence in our
00:09:15 ancestors even early ancestors that you write about for example in your new book
00:09:22 what what's the difference between the the fanciest brain we got which is the human brain
00:09:30 and  the ancestor brains that it came from yeah i think it depends on how far back you want to go
00:09:37 you go all the way back right in your book so what's the interesting comparison would you say well first of all i
00:09:43 wouldn't say that the human brain is the fanciest brain we've got i mean an octopus brain is pretty
00:09:49 different and pretty fancy and they can do some pretty amazing things that we cannot do you
00:09:54 know we can't grow back limbs we can't change color and texture we can't comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves
00:10:01 into a little crevice i mean these are things that we invent these are like superhero abilities that
00:10:06 we invent in stories right we can't do any of those things and so the human brain is certainly um
00:10:12 we can certainly do some things that other animals can't do that seem pretty impressive to us but but
00:10:21 i would say that there there are a number of animal brains which seem pretty impressive to me that can do
00:10:26 interesting things and really impressive things that we can't do i mean with your work on how emotions
00:10:32 are made and so on you you kind of repaint the the view of the brain as as less glamorous
00:10:41 i suppose than you would otherwise think or like i guess you draw a thread that connects all brains
00:10:48  together in terms of homeostasis and all that kind of stuff i yeah i wouldn't say that the that the
00:10:53 human brain is any less miraculous than anybody else would say
00:10:59 i just think that there are other brain structures which are also miraculous and i also think that there are a number
00:11:06 of things about the human brain which we share with other other vertebrates other animals with backbones
00:11:15 but that are that we share these miraculous things but we can do some things in abundance and we can also
00:11:21 do some things with our brains together working together that other animals
00:11:29 can't do or at least we haven't discovered their ability to do it yeah this social thing how i mean that's
00:11:35 one of the things you write about  what's  how do you make sense of the fact  like the book sapiens and
00:11:44 the fact that we're able to kind of connect like network our brains together like you write about i'll try i'll try
00:11:51 to stop saying that  is that is that like some kind of feature that's built into there is that unique
00:12:00 to our human brains like how do you make sense of that what i would say is that our ability to
00:12:08 coordinate with each other is not unique to humans there are lots of animals who can do that and we um
00:12:18 but what we do with that coordination is unique because of some of the structural features
00:12:27 in our brains and it's not that other animals don't have those structural features
00:12:34 it's we have them in abundance so you know the human brain is not larger than you would expect it to be for a
00:12:42 primate of our size if you took a chimpanzee and you ex grew it to the size of a human
00:12:51 that chimpanzee would have a brain that was the size of a human brain so there's nothing special about our
00:12:57 brain in terms of its size there's nothing special about our brain in terms of
00:13:04 the the basic blueprint that builds our brain from an embryo is the basic blueprint that builds all
00:13:12 mammalian brains and maybe even all vertebrate brains it's just that because of its size
00:13:19 and particularly because of the size of the cerebral cortex which is the a part that people mistakenly
00:13:29 attribute to rationality yeah mistakenly is that where all the clever stuff happens well
00:13:34 no it really isn't and i will also say that lots of clever stuff happens in animals who
00:13:39 don't have a cerebral cortex but right but  but because of the size of the
00:13:44 cerebral cortex and because of some of the features that are enhanced
00:13:51 by that size that gives us the capacity to do things like build civilizations and coordinate with each other not just to
00:14:03 manipulate the physical world but to add to it in very profound ways like you know
00:14:09 other animals can cooperate with each other and use tools we draw a line in the sand and we
00:14:16 make countries and we even then we create you know  we create citizens and immigrants
00:14:23 but also ideas i mean the countries are centered around the concept of like ideas well my well what do you
00:14:28 think a citizen is and and an immigrant those are ideas those are ideas
00:14:34 that we impose on reality and make them real and then they have very very serious and
00:14:39 real effects physical effects on people what do you think about the idea
00:14:43 that a bunch of people have written about dawkins with memes which is like ideas are breeding like
00:14:52 we're just like the canvas for ideas to breed in our brains so this kind of network that you talk about of brains
00:15:00 it's just a little canvas for ideas to then yeah eat against each other and so on i
00:15:05 i think it's a rhetorical tool it's cool to  think you know think that way so i think it was michael pollan
00:15:12 i don't remember if it was in the botany of desire but it was in one of his early books on on botany
00:15:22 and gardening where he wrote about and he wrote about  you know plants sort of utilizing humans for
00:15:30 their own you know evolutionary purposes which is kind of interesting you can
00:15:38 think about a human gut in a sense as a propagation device for the seeds of you know tomatoes and what
00:15:45 what have you so it's kind of cool so i think i think rhetorically it's an interesting
00:15:49 device but you know ideas are as far as i know invented by humans propagated by humans
00:16:00 so you know i i don't think they're separate from human brains in in any way although it would it is
00:16:05 interesting to to think about it that way well of course the ideas that are using your brain
00:16:12 to communicate and write excellent books  and they basically picked you  lisa as an effective communicator
00:16:21 and and thereby are winning so that's an interesting world view to think that there's particular aspects
00:16:28 of your brain that are conducive to certain sets of ideas and maybe those ideas will win out yeah
00:16:34 i think the way that i would say it really though is that there are many species of animals that
00:16:40 influence each other's nervous systems that regulate each other's nervous systems and they mainly do it by physical means
00:16:45 they do it by chemicals scent they do it by you know so so termites and ants and bees for example
00:16:56 use chemical scents mammals like like rodents use scent and they also use  hearing audition and that little
00:17:04 bit of vision primates you know non-human primates add vision
00:17:10 right and i think everybody uses touch humans as far as i know are the only species that use
00:17:20 ideas and words to regulate each other right i can text something to someone halfway around the world
00:17:26 they don't have to hear my voice they don't have to see my face and i can have an effect on their
00:17:31 nervous system and ideas the ideas that we communicate with words i mean words are in a sense a way for us
00:17:38 to do mental telepathy with each other right i mean i'm not the first person to say that obviously but
00:17:45 how do i control your heart rate how do i control your breathing how do i control your actions
00:17:51 with words it's because those words are communicating ideas so you also write i think let's go back
00:17:57 to the brain you write that plato gave us the idea that the human brain has
00:18:05 three brains in it three forces which is kind of a compelling notion  you disagree
00:18:11 first of all what are the three parts of the brain and  why do you disagree
00:18:20 so plato's description of the psyche which for the moment we'll just assume is the same as a mind
00:18:26 there are some scholars who would say you know a soul a psyche a mind those aren't actually all the same thing
00:18:31 in ancient greece but we'll just for now gloss over that so plato's idea was that
00:18:39 and it was a it was a description of really about moral behavior and moral responsibility in humans
00:18:46 so the idea was that you know the human psyche can be described with an a metaphor of
00:18:55 two horses and a charioteer so one horse for instincts like feeding and fighting and fleeing and
00:19:05 reproduction i'm trying to control my which apparently they print in england like i actually tossed off of
00:19:18 f s yeah f f okay yeah yeah i was like you printed that i couldn't believe you printed that
00:19:22 without like the stars or whatever no no no there was full print yeah they also printed the a b word and
00:19:27 it was really quite yeah anyways we should we should  learn something from england
00:19:34 indeed anyways but instincts and then the other horse represents emotions and then the cherry
00:19:40 tier represents rationality which controls you know the two beasts right and fast forward you know
00:19:51 couple of centuries and  in the middle of the 20th century there was a very
00:19:58 popular view of brain evolution which suggested that you have this  reptilian core like a lizard bra an
00:20:05 inner lizard brain for instincts and then wrapped around that
00:20:12 evolved on layer on top of that evolved a limbic system for  in mammals so the novelty was in
00:20:18 a mammalian brain which  bestowed mammals with  gave them emotions the capacitive emotions
00:20:28 and then on top of that  evolved  a cerebral cortex which in
00:20:38 in largely in primates but but very large in in humans and it's not that i personally disagree
00:20:49 it's that as far back as the 1960s but really by the 1970s it was shown pretty clearly with evidence from molecular genetics so
00:20:57 peering into cells in the brain to look at the molecular makeup of genes that the brain
00:21:05 did not evolve that way and the irony is that you know the the idea of the
00:21:16 the three-layered brain with an inner lizard you know that hijacks your  hijacks your behavior
00:21:22 and causes you to do and say things that  you would otherwise not or maybe that you will regret later
00:21:30 that idea became very popular was popularized by  carl sagan in the dragons of eden
00:21:38 which won a pulitzer prize in 1977 when it was already known pretty much in evolutionary neuroscience that the
00:21:47 whole  narrative was a myth so well the narrative is on the the way it evolved but do you
00:21:55 i mean again it's that problem of it being a useful tool of conversation to say like there's
00:22:02 a lizard brain and there's a like if i get overly emotional on twitter
00:22:09 that was the lizard brain and so on  but do you no i don't think it's useful i think it's a
00:22:15 i think that is it is is it  is it useful is it accurate i don't think it's accurate and
00:22:20 therefore i don't think it's useful so i here's what i would say you know i think that
00:22:26 the way i think about philosophy and science is that they are useful tools for living
00:22:36 and in order to be useful tools for living the try and brain as it's called this this three-layer brain the idea that
00:22:52 your brain is like an already baked cake in and you know the cortex cerebral cortex is just layered on top like icing
00:23:01 the idea that idea is the foundation of the law in most western countries it's the
00:23:08 foundation of  economic theory and it largely and it's a great narrative it
00:23:14 sort of fits our intuitions about how we work but it also it's in addition to being wrong
00:23:25 it lets people off the hook for  for nasty behavior you know and it also suggests that emotions can't
00:23:33 be a source of wisdom which they often are in fact you you would not want to be around someone
00:23:41 who didn't have emotions that would be that's a psychopath right i mean that's not someone you
00:23:49 you know want to want to really  have have that person deciding your outcome so i guess my
00:23:53 and i could sort of go on and on and on but my point is that i don't think
00:24:01 i don't think it's a useful narrative in the end what's the more accurate view of the
00:24:07 brain that we should use when we're thinking about it i'll answer that in a second but i'll
00:24:11 say that even our notion of what an instinct is or what a reflex is is not quite right right so if you look at evidence
00:24:22 from ecology for example and you look at animals in their ecological context what you can see is that even things
00:24:28 which are reflexes are very context-sensitive the the brains of those animals are executing
00:24:39 so-called instinctual actions in a very very context-sensitive way and so you know even when
00:24:46 a physician you know takes the you know it's like the idea of your patellar  reflex where they hit you know your
00:24:52 patellar tendon on your knee and you you kick the the force with which you kick
00:24:58 and so on in is influenced by all kinds of things it's it's a reflex isn't like a robotic
00:25:06  response and so i think a better way is a way that to think about how brains work is the
00:25:14 way that matches our best understanding our best scientific understanding which i think is
00:25:22 really cool  because it's really counterintuitive so how i came to this view and i'm certainly not the only one who
00:25:29 holds this view i was reading work in on neuroanatomy and the the view that i'm about to tell you was
00:25:37 sugges strongly suggested by that and then i was reading work and signal processing like by engineer electrical engineering
00:25:45 and similarly it the work suggested that that the research suggested that the brain worked this way and
00:25:50 i'll just say that i was reading across multiple literatures and they were who don't speak to each other and they
00:25:57 were all pointing in this direction and so far although some of the details are still
00:26:05 up for grabs the general gist i think is i've not come across anything yet which really violates and i'm looking um
00:26:13 and so the idea is something like this it's very counterintuitive so the way to describe it is to say
00:26:21 that your brain doesn't react to things in the world it's not it to us it feels like our eyes
00:26:26 and our our windows on the world we see things we hear things
00:26:33 we we react to them in psychology we call this stimulus response so your face is your voice is a stimulus
00:26:39 to me i receive input and then i react to it  and i might react very automatically
00:26:50 you know system one  and  oh but i also might execute some control where i
00:26:57 maybe stop myself from saying something or doing something and more in a more reflective way
00:27:04 execute a different action right that's system two the way the brain works though is it's
00:27:10 predicting all the time it's constantly talking to itself constantly  talking to your body  and it's constantly
00:27:20 predicting what's going on in the body and what's going on in the world and making predictions and
00:27:28 the information from your body and from the world really confirm or correct those predictions so
00:27:34 fundamentally the thing that the brain does most of the time is just predict like talking to yourself and
00:27:41 predicting stuff about the world not like this dumb thing that just senses in response senses
00:27:47 yeah so the way the way to think about it is like this you know your brain is  trapped in a dark silent box yeah
00:27:53 that's very romantic of you which is your skull and the only information that it receives
00:28:04 from your body and from the world right is through the senses through the sense organs your eyes your ears and you have
00:28:13 a sense sensory data that comes from your body that you're largely unaware of  to
00:28:20 your brain which we call interroceptive as opposed to exteroceptive which is the world around you
00:28:27 and but your brain is receiving sense data continuously which are the effect of some set of causes
00:28:39 your brain doesn't know the cause of these sense data it's only receiving the effects of those causes which are the
00:28:46 data themselves and so your brain has to solve what philosophers call an inverse inference problem
00:28:53 how do you know when you only receive the effects of something how do you know what caused those effects so
00:28:59 when there's a flash of light or a change in air pressure or a tug somewhere in your body
00:29:07 how does your brain know what caused those events so that it knows what to do next to keep you alive and well
00:29:17 and the answer is that your brain has one other source of information available to it which is your past experience
00:29:28 it can reconstitute in its wiring past experiences and it can combine those past experiences
00:29:36 in novel ways and so we have lots of names for this in psychology we call it memory
00:29:42 we call it perceptual inference we call it's also we call it concepts or conceptual knowledge
00:29:52 we call it prediction basically if we were to stop the world right now stop time
00:30:00 your brain is in a state what it believes is going on in your body and in the world
00:30:10 and it's predicting what will happen next based on past experience right probabilistically what's most likely to happen
00:30:18 and it begins to prepare your action and it begins to
00:30:30 prepare your the prepare your experience based so it's anticipating the sense data it's going to receive
00:30:38 and then when that those data come in they either confirm that prediction and your action executes
00:30:44 because the plan has already been made or it where there's some  sense data that your brain
00:30:52 didn't predict that's unexpected and your brain takes it in we say encodes it we have a fancy name for
00:30:59 that we call it learning your brain learns and it updates its storehouse of knowledge which we call an
00:31:07 internal model and  that you so that you can predict better next time and it turns out that predicting and
00:31:13 correcting predicting and correcting is a much more metabolically efficient way to run a system
00:31:18 than constantly reacting all the time because if you're constantly reacting it means you have no
00:31:22 you can't anticipate in any way what's going to happen and so the the amount of uncertainty that you have
00:31:27 to deal with is  overwhelming to a nervous system metabolically costly i like it
00:31:35 and so what is a reflex a reflex is when your brain doesn't check against the sense data that the potential cost
00:31:46 to you is so great maybe because you know your life is threatened that your brain
00:31:51 makes the prediction and executes the action without checking yeah so but prediction is still at the core that's a beautiful
00:31:59 vision of the brain i wonder from almost an ai perspective but just computationally is the brain just mostly a prediction
00:32:06 machine then like is the perception just the nice little feature added on top like the
00:32:15 both the the integration of new perceptual information i wonder how big of an impressive system
00:32:23 is that relative to just the big predictor model construction well i think that we can
00:32:29 we can look to evolution for that for one answer which is that when you go back you know
00:32:35 550 million years give or take we you know the world was populated by creatures really ruled by creatures
00:32:42 without brains and you know that's a biological statement not a political statement really world
00:32:49 war ii dinosaurs dumb you're talking about like oh no i'm not talking about dinosaurs
00:32:53 honey i'm talking way back further back than that really these they're these little
00:33:01 little creatures called  amphioxus which is the modern it's a or a lancet that's the modern animal
00:33:08 but it's an animal that scientists believe is very similar to our common the common ancestor
00:33:14 that we share  with invertebrates because  basically because of the tracing back
00:33:23 the molecular genetics and cells and that animal had no brain it had some cells that would later turn
00:33:31 into a brain but in that animal there's no brain but that animal also had no head and it had no eyes and it had no ears
00:33:38 and it had really really no senses for the most part it had very very limited sense of touch it had
00:33:47 an eye spot for not for seeing but just for in training to circadian rhythm to
00:33:52 light and dark and it had no hearing it had a vestibular cell
00:33:57 so that it could keep upright in the water at the time approx we're talking evolutionary scale here so
00:34:05 you know give or take some 100 million years or something but at the time you know what are the
00:34:10 vertebrate like when of when a backbone evolved and a brain evolved a full brain that was when a head evolved with sense with
00:34:21 sense organs and when that's when your viscera like internal systems involved so
00:34:27 the answer i would say is that that senses nurse motor neuroscientists people who study the control of motor behavior
00:34:38 believe that senses evolved in the service of motor action so the idea is that like
00:34:47 what triggered the what triggered what was what was the big evolutionary change what was the big
00:34:53 pressure  that made it useful to have eyes and ears and a visual system and an auditory system and a
00:35:00 brain basically and you know and the answer that is you know commonly entertained right now
00:35:08 is that it was predation that when at some point an animal evolved that deliberately ate
00:35:16 another animal and this launched an arms race between predators and prey
00:35:24 and it became very useful to have senses right so these these little antioxidants these little amphioxy
00:35:33 you know don't really have they they don't have an they're not aware of their environment very much
00:35:40 really they  and so being able to look up ahead and you know
00:35:49 ask yourself you know is that you know should i eat that or will it eat me is is a very useful thing so the idea
00:35:59 is that sense sense sense data is not there for consciousness it didn't evolve for the purposes of consciousness
00:36:05 it didn't evolve for the purposes of experiencing anything it evolved  in the cert
00:36:13 to be in the service of motor control however maybe it's useful this is why you know scientists sometimes 
00:36:25 avoid questions about why things evolved that this is what philosophers call this teleology you
00:36:29 might be able to say something about how things evolve but not necessarily why we don't really
00:36:38 know the why that's all speculation but the y is kind of nice here this
00:36:44 the interesting thing is  that was the first element of social interaction is am i gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me
00:36:55 it's useful to be able to see each other sense each other that's kind of fascinating that there
00:37:01 was a time when life didn't eat each other or they did by accident right so an amphioxus for example
00:37:10 well it kind of like gyrates in the water and then it plants itself in the sand like a blade of like a living blade of
00:37:17 grass and then it just filters  whatever comes into its mouth right so it is it is eating but it's not actively
00:37:27 hunting and when the concentration of food decreases it the amphioxus can sense this
00:37:39 and so it basically wriggles itself randomly to some other spot which probabilistically will have more food
00:37:45 than wherever it is so it's not really you know it's not guiding its actions
00:37:52 on the basis of it's not we would say there's no real intentional action in that in that in the traditional
00:38:00 sense speaking of intentional action and if the brain is put if prediction is indeed a core component of the brain let me ask
00:38:09 you a question that scientists also hate is  about free will so how does  do you think about free will much how
00:38:17 does that fit into this into your view of the brain why does it feel like
00:38:25 we make decisions in this world this is a hard q a scientists hate this because it's a hard
00:38:28 it's a hard question we don't know they're taken aside i think i have free will i think i have
00:38:33 taken aside but it it i don't put a lot of stock in my own intuitions or anybody's intuitions about
00:38:40 the cause of things right our ex one thing we know about the brain for sure is that the brain creates
00:38:46 experiences for us my brain creates experiences for me your brain creates experiences for you
00:38:52 in a way that lures you to believe that those experiences actually reveals the way that it works
00:38:57 right but it doesn't so so you don't trust your own intuition about not really not really no i mean no but
00:39:05 but i am also somewhat persuaded by you know i think dan dennett wrote at one point
00:39:12 like  you know the philosopher dan dennett wrote at one point that it it's i can't say it as eloquently
00:39:18 as him but it people obviously have free will they are obviously making choices so
00:39:24 it's you know and so there is this observation that we're not robots and we can do some things like a little more sophisticated
00:39:33 than an amphioxus so so here's what i would say i would say that your predictions your internal model
00:39:43 that's running right now right that your ability to understand the sounds that i'm making
00:39:48 and attach them to ideas is based on the fact that you have years of experience knowing what
00:39:56 these sounds mean in a particular statistical  pattern right i mean that's how you can
00:40:03 understand the words that are coming out of my mouth right i think we did this once
00:40:09 before too didn't we when we were i don't know i would have to access my memory module i think when i was in your
00:40:15 glen classic yeah i think we did it just like that actually so bravo wow yeah i have to go look look back to
00:40:21 the tape yeah anyways the the idea though is that your brain is using past
00:40:29 experience and it can and it can use past experience in so it's remembering but you're not
00:40:36 consciously remembering it's basically re-implementing prior experiences as a way of predicting what's going to
00:40:43 happen next and it can do something called conceptual combination which is it can take bits and pieces of the past
00:40:50 and combine it in new ways so you can experience and make sense of things that you've never encountered
00:40:58 before because you've encountered something and so a brain in a sense is not um
00:41:12 just doesn't just contain information it is information gaining meaning it can create it new information
00:41:20 by this generative process so in a sense you could say well that maybe that's that's a source of free will but i think
00:41:25 really where free will comes from or the kind of free will that i think is worth having a conversation about is um
00:41:35 involves cultivating experiences for yourself that change your internal model when you were born and you were raised
00:41:44 in a particular context that your mod your brain wired itself to your surroundings to your physical
00:41:52 surroundings and also to your social surroundings so you were handed an internal model basically but  when you grow up
00:42:04 the more control you have over your where you are and what you do you can cultivate new experiences for
00:42:14 yourself and those new experiences can change your internal model and you can actually
00:42:21 practice those experiences in a way that makes them automatic meaning it makes it easier for the brain
00:42:29 your brain to make them again and i think that that is something like what you would call free will you aren't responsible
00:42:41 for the model that you were handed that someone you know your your caregivers  cultivated a model in your brain
00:42:49 you're not responsible for that model but you are responsible for the one you have now
00:42:55 you can choose you choose what you expose yourself to you choose  how you spend your time
00:43:02 not everybody has choice over everything right but everybody has a little bit of choice and and so i think
00:43:11 that is  something that i think is arguably called free will yeah there's this like the the ripple
00:43:17 effects of the billions of decisions you make early on in life
00:43:23 have are so great that  even if it's not even if it's like all deterministic just
00:43:34 the amount of possibilities that are created and then the focusing of those possibilities into a single trajectory
00:43:44  that somewhere within that that's free will even if it's all deterministic that might as well be
00:43:52 of just the number of choices that are possible and the fact that you just make one trajectory to those set of choices seems
00:43:57 to be like something like they'll be called free will but it's still kind of sad to think like
00:44:03 there doesn't seem to be a place where there's magic in there where it is all just a computer well
00:44:09 there's lots of magic i would say so far because we don't really understand
00:44:17  how all of this is exactly i mean scientists are working hard and disagree about some of the details under the hood
00:44:27 of what i just described but i think there's quite a bit of magic actually and also there's
00:44:36 there's also stochastic firing of neurons don't they they're not purely digital in the sense that
00:44:46 there is there's also analog communication between neurons not just digital so it's not just with not just with
00:44:51 firing of axons and some of that there's there are other ways to communicate and
00:44:59 also  there's noise in the system and the noise is there
00:45:06 for a really good reason and that is the more variability there is the more potential there is for your brain to
00:45:16 be able to be information bearing so basically you know there are some animals that
00:45:23 have clusters of cells the only job is to inject noise you know into their neural patterns
00:45:29 so maybe noise is the source of free will so you can think about you can think about stochasticity or noise as
00:45:37 as a source of free will or you can think of of conceptual combination as a source
00:45:42 of free will you can certainly think about cultivating 
00:45:48 you know you can't reach back into your past and change your past you know people try by
00:45:54 psychotherapy and so on but right think about that sentence so one way to think about it is that you're
00:46:09 continuously this is a colleague of mine a friend of mine said so what you're saying is that people are continually cultivating
00:46:16 their past and i was like that's very poetic yes you are continually cultivating your past so you think  yeah i guess the the
00:46:30 construction of the mental model that you use for prediction ultimately contains within it your
00:46:37 perception of the past like the way you interpret the past or even just the entirety of your narrative about the past
00:46:43 so you're constantly rewriting the story of your past oh boy yeah that's one poetic and also
00:46:51 just awe inspiring what about the other thing you talk about you've mentioned about sensory
00:46:59 perception as a thing that like is just you have to infer about the sources of the thing that you have perceived
00:47:07 through your senses so  let me ask the another ridiculous question is is
00:47:13 anything real at all like how do we know it's real how do we make sense
00:47:18 of the fact that just like you said there's this brain sitting alone in the darkness trying to perceive the world
00:47:24 how do we know that the world is out there i will be perceived yeah so i don't think
00:47:30 that you should be asking questions like that without passing a joint right no for sure yeah i actually did
00:47:36 before this so i apologize okay no well that's okay you apologize for not sharing that's okay
00:47:41 so i mean here's what i would say what i would say is that the reason why we can be pretty sure that there's a
00:47:47 there there is that the the structure of the information in the world
00:47:54 what we call statistical regularities in sights and sounds and so on and the structure of the information
00:47:59 that comes from your body it's not random stuff there's a structure to it there's a
00:48:04 spatial structure and a temporal structure and that spatial and temporal structure wires your brain
00:48:12 so an infant brain is not a miniature adult brain it's a brain that is waiting for wiring
00:48:19 instructions from the world and it must receive those wiring instructions to develop in a typical way so for example
00:48:29 when a newborn is born when a newborn is born when a when a baby is born the baby can't see
00:48:38 very well because the visual system in that baby's brain is not complete the
00:48:46 the retina of your eye which actually is part of your brain has to be stimulated with photons of
00:48:51 light if it's not the baby won't develop normally to be able to see
00:48:57 in in a neurotypical way same thing is true for hearing the same thing is true really for all
00:49:01 your senses so the point is that that the physical world the sense data from
00:49:09 the physical world wires your brain so that you have an internal model
00:49:15 of that world so that your brain can predict well to keep you alive and well and allow you to thrive that's
00:49:23 fascinating that the brain is waiting for a very specific kind of  set of instructions from the world like not
00:49:30 not the specific but a very specific kind of instruction yes so you scientists call it expectable input
00:49:38 the brain needs some input in order to develop normally and so we're and we are genetically
00:49:45 you know we as i say in the book we we have the kind of nature that requires nurture we we can't develop normally without sense
00:49:53 input sensory input from the world and from the body and what's really interesting about
00:49:58 humans and some other animals too but really seriously in humans is the input that we need
00:50:11 is not just physical it's also social we in order for an an infant a human infant to develop normally
00:50:20 that infant needs eye contact touch it needs certain types of smells it needs to be
00:50:27 cuddled it needs right so without social input the brain it's that that infant's brain
00:50:35 will not wire itself in a neurotypical way and again i would say
00:50:43 there are lots of cultural patterns of caring for an infant it's not like the infant has to
00:50:49 be cared for in one way whatever the social environment is for an infant that it will will be
00:50:58 reflected in that infant's internal model so we have lots of different cultures lots of different
00:51:02 ways of rearing children and that's an advantage for our species although we don't always experience it
00:51:07 that way that is an advantage for our species but if you
00:51:14 if you just you know feed and water a baby without all the extra social doodads what you get is a profoundly impaired
00:51:26  human yeah but nevertheless you're kind of saying that the physical reality
00:51:33 has  has a consistent thing throughout that keeps feeding these set of sensory information that our
00:51:42 brains are constructed for but yeah the cool thing though is that if you change the consistency
00:51:48 if you change the statistical regularities so prediction error your brain can learn it it's expensive
00:51:54 for your brain to learn it and it takes a while to for the brain to get really automated
00:51:58 with it but you know you had a wonderful conversation with david eagleman who just published a book
00:52:05 about this yeah and gave lots and lots of really very very cool examples some of which i actually discussed in
00:52:11 how emotions were made but not obviously to the extent that he did in his book which it's a fascinating
00:52:16 book and it's but it it speaks to the point that your internal model is always under construction
00:52:27 and therefore you always can modify your experience i wonder what the limits are
00:52:33 like  if we can if we put it on mars or if we put in virtual reality or if we sit at home during a pandemic
00:52:41 and we spend most of our day on twitter and tick tock like i wonder what where the breaking
00:52:46 point like the limitations of the brain's capacity to  to properly continue wiring itself
00:52:56 well i think what i would say is that there are different ways to specify your question right like one way
00:53:02 to specify it would be the way that david phrases it which is can we can we create a new sense like
00:53:13 can we create a new sensory modality how hard would that be what are the limits in doing that
00:53:21 and but another way to say it is what what happens to a brain when you
00:53:26 remove some of those statistical regularities right like what happens to a brain what happens to an adult brain
00:53:30 when you remove some of the statistical patterns that were there and
00:53:37 they're not there anymore you're talking about in the environment or in the actual like
00:53:43 you remove eyesight for example or did you well either way i mean basically one way to limit
00:53:50 the inputs to your brain are to stay home and protect yourself another way is to put someone
00:53:58 in solitary confinement another way is to stick them  in a nursing home another well not all nursing homes but
00:54:05 you know but there are some right which really are some where peop people are somewhat
00:54:13 impoverished in the interactions the end this sensory the variety of sensory stimulation that they get
00:54:21 another way is that you lose a sense right but the point is i think that you know the human brain really
00:54:31 likes variety to to say it in a you know like a pro you know sort of cartesian way
00:54:38 you know variety is a good thing for a brain and  there are risks that you take 
00:54:51 when you restrict  what you expose yeah you know there's always talk of diversity the brain loves it to the fullest
00:55:01 definition and degree of diversity yeah i mean i would say the only thing basically human brains thrive
00:55:08 on diversity the only place where we seem to have difficulty with diversity is with each other
00:55:15 right but we who wants to eat the same food every day you never would who wants to wear the
00:55:19 same clothes every day i mean my husband if you ask him to close his eyes he won't be able to tell you what
00:55:23 he's wearing he's just right he'll buy seven shirts of exactly the same style in different colors
00:55:30 but they are in different colors right it's not like how would you then explain my brain which is
00:55:37 terrified of choice and therefore i wore the same thing every time well you must be getting your diversity
00:55:42 well first of all you are a fairly sharp dresser so there is that but so you're getting
00:55:47 some reinforcement progressing the way that you do but well your brain must get diversity
00:55:51 in in other words in other places but i think we you know the the so there the two most expensive
00:55:59 things your brain can do metabolically speaking is is move your body and  learn something new
00:56:11 so novelty that is diversity right comes at a cost a metabolic cost but it's a cost it's an investment that
00:56:21 that gives returns and in general people vary in how much they like novelty unexpected things
00:56:26 some people really like it some people really don't like it and there's everybody in between
00:56:31 but in general we don't eat the same thing every day we don't usually do exactly the same thing
00:56:38 in exactly the same order in exactly the same place every day the only place we have difficulty
00:56:46  with diversity in is in each other and then we we have considerable problems there
00:56:54 i would say as a species let me ask  i don't know if you're familiar with donald hoffman's work about
00:57:01 this like questions of reality what are your thoughts of the possibility that the very thing we've been talking about
00:57:10 of the brain wiring itself from birth to a particular set of inputs is just a little slice of reality that there is something
00:57:18 much bigger out there that we humans with our cognition cognitive capabilities is just not even perceiving
00:57:25 that the thing we're perceiving is just the crappy like windows 95 interface onto a much
00:57:34 bigger richer set of complex physics that we're not even in touch with
00:57:40 well without getting too metaphysical about it i think we know for sure it doesn't have to be the
00:57:47 you know crappy version of anything but we definitely have a limited we have we have a set of senses that are
00:57:55 limited in very physical ways and we're clearly not perceiving everything there is to perceive
00:58:00 that's clear i mean it's just it's not that hard we can't without special why do we invent
00:58:05 scientific tools it's so that we can overcome our senses and and experience things that we couldn't
00:58:11 otherwise whether they are you know different parts of the  visual spectrum the light spectrum
00:58:17 or things that are too microscopically small for us to see or too far away for us to see
00:58:25 so clearly we're only getting a slice and that slice you know the interesting or
00:58:38 potentially sad thing about humans is that we whatever we experience we think there's
00:58:44 a natural reason for experiencing it and we think it's obvious and natural and it must be this way
00:58:49 and that all the other stuff isn't important and that's clearly not true many of the things that we think of as natural
00:58:58 are anything but we've cr they're certainly real but we've created them they certainly have very real impacts
00:59:05 but we've created those impacts and we also know that there are many things outside of our awareness that have
00:59:12 have tremendous influence on what we experience and what we do so there's no question that that's
00:59:19 true i mean just it's it's but the extent is how fantastic really the question is how fantastical is it
00:59:25 yeah like what you know a lot of people ask me i'm i'm not allowed to say this i think i'm
00:59:29 allowed to say this  i've eaten shrooms a couple times but i haven't gone the full
00:59:34 i'm talking to a few researchers and psychedelics it's an interesting scientifically place like what is the
00:59:40 portal you're entering when you take psychedelics or another would ask is like dreams whatever so let me tell you what
00:59:47 i think which is based on nothing like this is based on my life right so i don't
00:59:53 your intuition it's based on my it's based on my i'm guessing now based on what i do know
01:00:00 i would say but i think that well think about what happens so you're running your brain's running
01:00:05 this internal model right and it's all outside of your awareness really you see the you feel the products but
01:00:10 you don't you don't sense the you have no awareness of the mechanics of it right
01:00:16 it's going on all the time and so one thing that's going on all the time that you're completely unaware of
01:00:23 is that when your brain your brain is basically asking itself figuratively speaking not literally right like
01:00:30 how is the scent given the last time i was in this sensory array with this stuff going on in my body and i
01:00:36 and that this chain of events which just occurred what did i do next what did i feel next what did i see next
01:00:43 it doesn't come up with one answer it comes up with a distribution of it possible answers
01:00:49 and then there has to be some selection process and so you have a network in your brain a
01:00:56 subnetwork in your brain a population of neurons that helps to choose it's not i'm not talking about a
01:01:04 homunculus in your brain or anything silly like that this is not the soul it's not the center of yourself
01:01:12 or anything like that but there a a set of neurons that weighs the probabilities  um and and helps
01:01:24 to select  or narrow the field okay and that that network is working all the time
01:01:32 it's actually called the control network the executive control network or you can call it a fronto parietal
01:01:37 because the regions of the brain that make it up or in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe
01:01:43 there are also parts that belong to the subcortical parts of your brain it doesn't really matter the point is
01:01:47 that that there is this network and it is working all the time whether or not you feel in control
01:01:51 whether or not you feel like you're expending effort doesn't really matter it's on all the time
01:01:59 except when you sleep when you sleep it's it's a little bit relaxed and so think about what's happening when
01:02:06 you sleep when you sleep the extra the external world recedes the sense data
01:02:15 from so basically your model becomes a little bit the tethers from the world are loosened
01:02:22 and this network which is involved in you know maybe weeding out unrealistic things
01:02:31 is a little bit quiet so use your dreams are really your internal model that's
01:02:39 unconstrained by the immediate world except so you can do things that you can't do in real life
01:02:46 in your dreams right you can fly like i for example when i fly on my back in a dream i'm much faster
01:02:51 than when i fly on my front don't ask me why i don't know when you're laying and you're back in your
01:02:55 dream no when i'm in my dream and flying in a dream i am much faster flyer in the air very
01:03:06 i don't think i've flown for many years well you must try it i've i've thought i've  flown  i've fallen
01:03:13 that's scary yeah but you fl you're talking about like yeah i fly my dreams and i'm way faster right
01:03:20 and you're better on my back way faster now you can say well you know you never flew in your life right it's conceptual
01:03:26 combination i mean i've flown in an airplane and i've seen birds fly and i've watched movies of people flying and
01:03:34 i know superman probably flies i don't know if he flies faster on his back but he's voice he's out of never he's lying
01:03:39 on his front right but yeah but anyways my point is that you know all of this stuff
01:03:46 really all these experiences really become part of your internal model the thing is that when you're asleep
01:03:53 your internal model is still being constrained by your body your your brain's always attached to
01:03:59 your body it's always receiving sense data from your body you're mostly never aware of it
01:04:07  unless you run up the stairs  or or you know  maybe you are ill in some way
01:04:12 but you're mostly not aware of it which is a really good thing because if you were you know you'd never pay attention to
01:04:18 anything outside your own skin ever again like right now you seem like you're sitting there very calmly but you have a
01:04:25 virtual whole thing drama right it's like a like a like an opera going on inside
01:04:30 your body and so i think that one of the things that happens
01:04:38 when people take psilocybin or take  you know ketamine for example is that the tethers
01:04:48 completely are completely removed yeah yeah that's fascinating and then and that's why it's helpful to have a guide
01:04:55 right because the guide is giving you sense data to steer that internal model so that it
01:05:00 doesn't go completely off the rails yeah i know there's so again that wiring to
01:05:07 the other brain that's the guide is at least a tiny little tether exactly yeah let's talk about emotion a little bit if
01:05:14 we could emotion comes up often and i have never spoken with anybody who um
01:05:24 who has a clarity about emotion from a biological and neuroscience perspective that you do
01:05:32 and i'm not sure i fully know how to as a as a i mentioned this way too much but as somebody who was
01:05:39 born in the soviet union and romanticizes basically everything talks about
01:05:46 love non-stop you know emotion is a i don't know what to make of it i don't know so maybe  let's just try to talk about
01:05:55 it i mean from a neuroscience perspective we talked about a little bit last time your book covers it how emotions are
01:06:01 made but what are some misconceptions we writers of poetry
01:06:08 we romanticizing humans have about emotion that we should move away from before to think about emotion
01:06:18 from both a scientific and an engineering perspective yeah so there is a common view of emotion
01:06:26 in the west the caricature of that view is that you know we have an inner beast right
01:06:35 your limbic system your your inner lizard we have an inner beast
01:06:41 and that comes baked in to the brain at birth so you've got circuits for anger atmosphere it's interesting that they
01:06:47 all have english names these circles but that that and they're there and they're triggered by things in the world
01:06:55 and then they cause you to do and say and you know so when your fear circuit is triggered you widen your eyes
01:07:08 heart rate goes up you prepare to flee or to freeze and these are these are modal responses they're not
01:07:17 the only responses that you give but on average they're the prototypical responses that's the view and um
01:07:25 that's the view of emotion in the law that's the view you know that emotions are these
01:07:30 profoundly unhelpful things that are obligatory kind of like reflexes the problem with that view is that it
01:07:42 doesn't comport to the evidence and it doesn't really matter the evidence actually lines up
01:07:49 beautifully with each other it just doesn't line up with that view and it doesn't matter whether you're measuring
01:07:53 people's faces facial movements or you're measuring their body movements or measuring their
01:07:57 peripheral physiology or you're measuring their brains or their voices or whatever pick any any
01:08:04 output that you want to measure and you know any system you want to measure and you don't
01:08:09 really find strong evidence for this and i say this as somebody who who not only has reviewed really
01:08:14 thousands of articles and run you know big meta analyses which are statistical summaries of
01:08:22 of published papers but also as someone who has sent teams of researchers to small-scale cultures
01:08:33 you know remote cultures which are very different from urban large-scale cultures like ours and
01:08:43 one culture that we visited and i say we euphemistically because i i myself didn't go because i only had
01:08:49 two research permits and i gave them to my students because i felt like it was
01:08:56 better for them to have that experience and more formative for them to have that experience but i was in contact with them every day
01:09:02 by satellite phone and this was to visit the hadza hunter-gatherers in tanzania
01:09:13 who are not an ancient people they're a modern culture but they live
01:09:19 in circumstances hunting and foraging circumstances that are very similar in similar conditions to our ancestors
01:09:31  hunting gathering ancestors when expressions of emotion were supposed to have evolved
01:09:38 at least by one view of okay so i you know for many years i was sort of struggling with this set of observations right
01:09:48 which is that i feel emotion and i see i perceive emotion in other people but scientists can't find a single marker
01:09:58 a single biomarker not a single individual measure or pattern of measures that will can predict how someone what
01:10:06 kind of emotional state they're in how could that possibly be how how can you possibly make sense of those two things
01:10:16 and through a lot of reading and a lot of and immersing myself in different literatures i came to
01:10:24 the hypothesis that the brain is constructing these instances out of more basic ingredients
01:10:32 so when i tell you that the brain when i suggest you that what your brain is doing is making a prediction and it's asking
01:10:40 itself figuratively speaking the last time i was in this situation and this you know physical state what did i
01:10:48 do next what did i see next what did i hear next it's basically asking what in my past is
01:10:59 similar to the present things which are similar to one another a group of things which are similar to
01:11:09 one another as a category and a mental representation of a category is a concept
01:11:16 so your brain is constructing categories or concepts on the fly continuously so you really want to understand what a
01:11:22 brain is doing you don't using machine learning like classification models is not going to
01:11:27 help you because the brain doesn't classify it's doing category construction and the categories change or you could
01:11:35 say it's doing concept construction it's using past experience to and if it's using past experiences of emotion
01:11:49 then it's constructing an emotion concept your concept will be the content of it is
01:12:02 ism changes depending on the situation that you're in so for example if your brain
01:12:08 uses past experiences of anger that you have learned either because somebody labeled them for you taught them to you
01:12:17 you observed them in movies and so on in one situation could be very different from your concept
01:12:24 of for anger than another situation and this is how anger instances of anger are
01:12:31 what we call a population of variable instances sometimes when you're angry you scowl sometimes when you're angry
01:12:40 you might smile sometimes when you're angry you might cry sometimes your heart rate will go up
01:12:46 it will go down it will stay the same it depends on what action you're about to take because the way predict and i should say
01:12:54 the idea that physiology is yoked to action is a very old idea
01:13:01 in in  the study of the peripheral nervous system that's been known for really decades and so
01:13:07 if you look at what the brain is doing if you just look at the anatomy and you what here's the hypothesis that
01:13:12 you would that you would come up with and i can go into the details i've published these details in in
01:13:20 scientific papers and they also appear somewhat in how emotions are made my first book they
01:13:26 are not in the you know seven and a half lessons because that book is is really not pitched at
01:13:31 that level of explanation right it's just giving it's really just a set of
01:13:38 little essays but the evidence but what i'm about to say is actually based on on on scientific evidence
01:13:46 when your brain begins to make form a prediction the first thing it's doing is it's making a prediction of how to
01:13:54 change the internal systems of your body your heart your cardiovascular system the control of
01:14:00 your heart control of your lungs right a flush of of cortisol which is not a stress hormone it's a
01:14:07 hormone that gets glucose into your bloodstream very fast because your brain is predicting you need to do something metabolically
01:14:20 expensive and so so either that means either move or learn okay and
01:14:28 so your brain is preparing your body the internal systems of your body to execute some actions to move in some way
01:14:39 and the and then it infers based on those motor predictions and what we call visceral motor predictions
01:14:46 meaning the the the changes in the viscera that your brain is preparing
01:14:54 to to execute your brain makes an inference about what you will sense based on those motor movements
01:15:05 so your experience of the world and your experience of your own body are a consequence of those predictions those
01:15:15 concepts when your brain makes a concept for emotion it's constructing an instance of that emotion
01:15:24 and that is how emotions are made and those concepts load in the predictions that are made include
01:15:34 contents inside the body contents outside the body i mean it includes other humans so just
01:15:42 this construction of a concept includes the variables that are much richer than just
01:15:51 some sort of simple notion yeah so our colloquial notion of a concept where
01:15:58 you know where i say well what's the concept of a bird and then you list a set of features
01:16:02 off to me that's that's people's understanding you know typically of what a concept is but
01:16:09 if you go  into the literature in cognitive science what you'll see is that the way
01:16:14 that scientists have understood what a concept is has really changed over the years so
01:16:20 people used to think about a concept as philosophers and scientists used to think about a concept as a dictionary
01:16:27 definition for a category so there's a set of things which are similar out in the world
01:16:34 and your concept for for that category is a dictionary definition of the features
01:16:40 right the necessary insufficient features of that of those instances so for a bird you know would be
01:16:50 wings feathers right a beak yeah it flies whatever okay that's called the classical category
01:16:58 and scientists discovered observed that actually not all instances of birds have feathers and not all instances of birds
01:17:08 fly and so the idea was that you don't have a single representation of necessary and
01:17:12 sufficient features stored in your brain somewhere instead what you have is a prototype a prototype meaning
01:17:18 you still have a single representation for the category one but the features
01:17:27 are like of the most typical instance of the category or maybe the most frequent instance but not all
01:17:32 instances of the category have all the features right they they have some graded similarity
01:17:42 and then  you know what i'm gonna like incredibly simplify now a
01:17:49 lot of work to say that then a series of experiments were done
01:17:55 to show that in fact what your brain seems to be doing is coming up with a single
01:18:03 exemplar or instance of the category and reading off the features when i ask you for the concept
01:18:15 so if we were in a pet store and i asked you what are the features of a bird tell me the concept of bird
01:18:24 you would be more likely to give me features of a good pet and if we were in a restaurant
01:18:31 you would be more likely you know like a budgie right or a canary if we were in a restaurant you
01:18:35 would be more likely to give me the features of a bird that you would eat like a chicken and if we were in a park you'd
01:18:41 be more likely to give me  in this country  you know the features of a sparrow or
01:18:49 a robin whereas if we were in south america you would probably give me the features
01:18:57 of a peacock because that's more common or it's or it is more common there than here that you would see a peacock in
01:19:02 such circumstances so the idea was that really what your brain was doing
01:19:09 was conjuring a concept on the fly that meets the function that the category is being put to
01:19:21 okay yep okay then people started studying ad hoc concepts meaning
01:19:32 concepts that where the instances don't share any feat any physical features
01:19:39 but the function of the instances are the same so for example think about all the
01:19:43 things that can protect you from the rain what are all the things that can protect you from the rain
01:19:52  umbrella  like this apartment right like like a like a mindset yeah
01:20:07 right right so the idea is that the function of the instances is the same in a given situation even if they look different sound
01:20:14 different smell different this is called an abstract concept or a conceptual concept
01:20:24 now the really cool thing about conceptual categories or conceptual concept yes conceptual category a conceptual
01:20:33 as a category of things that are held together by a function which is called an abstract
01:20:38 concept or a conceptual category because the things don't share physical features they share functional features
01:20:45 there are two really cool things about this one is that's what darwin said a species was
01:20:55 so darwin is known for discovering natural selection but the other thing he really did which was
01:21:04 really profound which he's less celebrated for is understanding that all biological categories
01:21:13 have inherent variation inherent variation darwin wrote in the origin of species about
01:21:21 before darwin's book a species was thought to be a classical category where all the
01:21:29 instances of dogs were the same had exactly the same features and any variation from that
01:21:38 perfect platonic instance was considered to be error and darwin said
01:21:49 nature selects on the basis of that variation the reason why natural selection is powerful and can exist is because there is variation
01:22:01 in a species and in dogs we talk about that variation in terms of the
01:22:08 size of the dog and the  amount of fur the dog has and the color and the how long is the tail and how long is
01:22:14 this snout in humans we talk about that variation in all kinds of ways right including in
01:22:24 cultural ways so that's one thing that's really interesting about conceptual categories
01:22:30 is that darwin is basically saying a species is a conceptual category and in fact if you look at modern
01:22:36 debates about what is a species you can't find anybody agreeing on what the criteria are
01:22:43 for a species because they don't all share the same genome we don't all share we don't there isn't
01:22:49 a single human genome there's a population of genomes but they're variable it's not unbounded variation
01:23:01 but they are variable right and the other thing that's really cool about conceptual categories is that um
01:23:11 they are the categories that we use to make civilization so think about money for example
01:23:23 what are all the physical things that make something a currency is there any physical feature
01:23:29 that all the currencies in all the worlds that's ever been used by humans share well certainly right but  but what
01:23:37 what is it  is it definable you know so it's getting to the point that you're
01:23:43 because you're making it function it's the function right function it's that we trade it for material goods
01:23:49 and that and we have to agree right we all impose on whatever it is salt barley little shells big rocks in
01:23:55 the ocean that can't move bitcoin pieces of plastic mortgages which are basically a promise of
01:24:01 something in the future nothing more right all of these things we impose value on them and we all agree that we can exchange
01:24:11 them for material goods yeah and  yes that's bril by the way you're attributing some of that to darwin
01:24:17 that he thought no i'm no i'm saying that because it's a brilliant view of what a species is is the function
01:24:24 yeah what i'm saying is that what darwin darwin really talked about variation in so if you
01:24:30 read for example the biologist ernst mayer who was an evolutionary biologist and then when he retired
01:24:37 became a historian and philosopher of biology and his suggestion is that darwin darwin did talk about variation
01:24:47 he vanquished what's called essentialism the idea that there's a single set of features that define any species
01:25:00 and out of that grew really discussions of the function you know like some of the
01:25:07 functional features that species have like they can reproduce  off they can have offspring the
01:25:12 individuals of a species can have offspring it turns out that's not a perfect  you know that's not a perfect 
01:25:19 criterion to use but it's a functional criterion right so what i'm saying is that in cognitive
01:25:24 science people came up with the idea they discovered the idea of conceptual categories or
01:25:30 ad hoc concepts these concepts that can change based on the function they're serving right and
01:25:37  that it's there darwin it's in darwin and it's also in the philosophy of social reality you can
01:25:43 the way that philosophers talk about social reality just look around you i mean we impose we're treating a bunch
01:25:50 of things as similar which are physically different and sometimes we take things that are physically
01:25:57 the same and we treat them as separate categories but it feels like the number of variables involved in that kind of
01:26:05 categorization is nearly infinite no i don't think so because there is a physical constraint right like you and i
01:26:10 could agree that we can fly in real life but we can't that's a physical that's a
01:26:17 physical constraint that we can't break right you and i could agree that we could walk through the walls
01:26:23 right but we can't we could agree that we could eat glass but there's a lot of constraints but yeah we could agree that the virus
01:26:29 doesn't exist and we don't have to wear masks right yeah but you know physical reality still
01:26:37 holds the trump card right but still there's a lot of card well pun completely unattended but there you
01:26:44 go that's a predicting brain for you  but but there's a tremendous amount of leeway
01:26:52 yes yeah that's the point so what i'm saying is that emotions are like money basically they're they're like money
01:26:59 they're like countries they're like kings and queens and presidents they're like
01:27:05 everything that we construct that we impose meaning on we take these physical signals and we
01:27:10 give them meanings that they don't otherwise have by their physical nature
01:27:18 and because we agree yeah they have that function but the the beautiful thing so maybe unlike money
01:27:25 i love this similarity is it it's not obvious to me that this kind of emergent agreement should happen with emotion
01:27:33 because our experiences are so different for each of us humans and yet we kind of converge well in a
01:27:38 culture we converge but not across cultures there are huge huge differences
01:27:43 there are huge differences in what what concepts exist what their what they look like um
01:27:51 so what i would say is that they feel like what what we're doing with our young children as we as their brains become wired to their
01:28:03 physical and their social environment right is that we are curating for them we are bootstrapping
01:28:07 into their brains a set of emotion  concepts that's partly what they're learning and
01:28:15 we curate those for infants just the way we curate for them what is a dog what is a cat what is a truck
01:28:22 we sometimes explicitly label and we sometimes just use mental words when you know your kid is you know throwing cheerios on the
01:28:31 floor instead of eating them or your kid is crying when you know she won't put herself to sleep
01:28:39 or whatever you know we use mental words and a word is this words with for infants words are these
01:28:47 really special things that they help infants learn abstract categories there's a huge literature
01:28:54 showing that children can take things that don't look infants like infants really young infants
01:29:02 pre-verbal infants can take if you label if i say to you and you're an infant okay so i say lex lexi
01:29:13 this yeah is a bling yeah and i put it down and the bling makes a squeaky noise
01:29:19 and then i say unless he's excited by the way this is a bling and i put it down and it
01:29:24 makes a squeaky noise and then i say lexi this is a bling you
01:29:35 as young as four months old will expect this to make a noise a speaking noise and if you don't if it doesn't you'll be
01:29:42 surprised because it violated your expectation right i'm building for you an internal model of a bling yeah okay infants can do this
01:29:53 really really at a young age and so there's no reason to believe that they couldn't learn emotion
01:29:59 categories and concepts in the same way and in in one and what happens when you go to a new culture when you go to a new culture
01:30:10 you have to do what's called emotion acculturation so my colleague bacia mosquita in belgium
01:30:15 studies emotion acculturation she studies how when people move from one culture to another
01:30:20 how do they learn the emotion concepts of that culture how do they learn to make sense of their own
01:30:27 internal sensations and also the movements you know the rays of an eyebrow the tilt of a head how do they
01:30:33 learn to make sense of cues from other people using concepts they don't have but have to make
01:30:41 on the fly so that's the difference between cultures let me  open another door i'm not sure
01:30:46 i want to open but difference between men and women is there difference between the
01:30:53 emotional lives of those two categories of biological systems so here's what i would say you know we
01:31:02 did a series of studies  in the 1990s where we asked men and women to tell us about
01:31:09 their emotional lives and women described themselves as much more emotional than men
01:31:14 they believed that they were more emotional than men and men agreed women are much more emotional than men
01:31:21 okay and then we gave them little handheld computers these were little hewlett-packard
01:31:27 computers they fit in the palm of your hand a couple of pen they weighed a couple of pounds so this was like pre-palm pilot
01:31:32 even like this was you know 1990s and like early and we um
01:31:44 asked them we would you know ping them like 10 times a day and just ask them to report how they were feeling
01:31:51 which is called experience sampling so we experience sampled and and then at the end
01:31:59 and then we looked at their reports and we found is that men and women basically didn't differ
01:32:04 and there were some people who were really had many more instances of emotion so they were
01:32:12 you know they were treading  water in a tumultuous sea of emotion and then there were other people who
01:32:17 were like floating tranquilly you know in a lake it was
01:32:23 really not perturbed very often and and everyone in between but there were no difference between men
01:32:28 and women and the really interesting thing is at the end of the sampling period
01:32:34 we asked people so reflect over the past two weeks and tell it so you know we've been now pinging
01:32:39 people like again and again and again right so tell us how emotional do you think you are
01:32:47 no change from the beginning so men and women believe that they are they believe that they are
01:32:52 different and when they are looking at other people they make different inferences about emotion
01:33:00 if a man if a man is scowling like if you and i were together and some so somebody's watching this okay
01:33:14 when you look at the camera if you and i make exactly the same set of facial movements
01:33:24 when people look at you both men and women look at you they are more likely to think oh he's
01:33:30 reacting to the situation and when they look at me they'll say oh she's having an emotion she's
01:33:37 you know yeah and i wrote about this actually  right before the 2016 election
01:33:49 you know what maybe i could confess let me try to carefully confess but you are really gonna
01:33:56 yeah that i'm that when i that there is an element when i see hillary clinton that there was
01:34:06 something annoying about her to me and i just that feeling and then i tried to reduce that to
01:34:15 what what is that because i think the same attributes that are annoying about her when i seen other people
01:34:22 wouldn't be annoying so i was trying to understand what is it because it it certainly does feel like that
01:34:29 concept that i've constructed in my mind well i'll tell you that i think well let me just say that that that
01:34:36 what you would predict about for example the performance of the two of them in the debates and i wrote an op-ed for the
01:34:43 new york times actually before the second debate and it it played out really pretty much
01:34:50 as i thought that it would on based on research it's not like i'm like a great fortune teller or anything it's just i
01:34:55 was just applying the research which was that when a woman a woman's people make internal
01:35:03 attributions it's called they infer that the facial movements and body posture and vocalizations of a
01:35:10 woman reflect her inner state but for men they're more likely to assume that they reflect his response to
01:35:15 the situation it doesn't say anything about him it says something about the situation he's in
01:35:20 that's brilliant now for the thing that you are that you were describing about hillary clinton
01:35:27 i think a lot of people experienced but it's also in line with research which shows
01:35:32 and and particularly research actually on in about teaching evaluations is one
01:35:37 place that you really see it where the expectation is that a woman will be nurturant and that a man
01:35:46 there's just no expectation for him to be nurturing so he's you know if he is nurturant he gets points
01:35:54 if he's not he gets points right they're just different points right whereas for a woman
01:35:59 especially a woman who's an authority figure she's really in a catch-22 right because if she's serious she's a
01:36:09 and if she's empathic  then she's weak right that's brilliant i mean one of the bigger questions to ask
01:36:16 here so that's one example where our con construction of concepts gets right but remember you're in
01:36:21 trouble but so remember i said science is a science and philosophy are like tools for living so i learned recently
01:36:31 that if you ask me what is my intuition about what regulates my eating i will say carbohydrates i love
01:36:37 carbohydrates i love pasta i love bread i love i just love carbohydrates but actually research shows and it's
01:36:46 beautiful research i love this research because it so violates my own
01:36:52 like deeply deeply held beliefs about myself that most animals on this planet who have been studied and there are many
01:37:01 actually eat to regulate their protein intake so you will overeat carbohydrates if you in order to get enough protein and these
01:37:12 this research has been done with human very beautiful research with humans with crickets with like you
01:37:17 know bonobo i mean just like all these different animals not bonobos but i think like baboons
01:37:23 now that i have no intuition about that and i even now as i regulate my eating i don't i still i just have no intuition
01:37:31 it just i can't i can't feel it what i feel is only about the carbohydrates
01:37:37 it feels like you're regulating around carbohydrates not the protein yeah but in fact actually what i am doing if
01:37:42 i am like most  animals on the planet i am regulating around proteins so
01:37:49 knowing this what do i do i correct my behavior to eat to to actually deliberately try to focus on the protein that
01:37:59 this is the idea behind bias training right like if you um
01:38:07 i also did not experience hillary clinton as the warmest
01:38:14 candidate however you can use consistent science since the consistent scientific
01:38:21 findings to organize your behavior that doesn't mean that rationality is
01:38:29 the absence of emotion because sometimes emotion or scent anything feelings in general not the same thing as emotion that's
01:38:36 another topic but you know our our source of of information and their wisdom and
01:38:44 helpful so i'm not saying that but what i am saying is that if you have a deeply held belief and the evidence
01:38:49 shows that you're wrong then you're wrong it doesn't really matter how confident you feel
01:38:54 you that confidence could be also explained by science right so it would be the same thing as if i
01:39:01 regardless of whether someone is like charlie baker right regardless of whether somebody is a republican or a democrat
01:39:07 if that person has a record that you can see is consistent with what you believe then that is information that you can act on
01:39:18 yeah and and then so try to i mean this is kind of what empathy is in open-mindedness is try to um
01:39:25 consider that the set of concepts that your your brain has constructed through which you are now perceiving the
01:39:30 world is not painting the full picture i mean this is now true for basically ever
01:39:36 it doesn't have to be men and women it could be basically the prism through which we pursue actually the
01:39:43 political discourse right absolutely so so here's what i would say the you know there are
01:39:51 people who scientists who will talk to you about cognitive empathy and emotional empathy and
01:39:59 i i prefer to think of it i think the evidence is more consistent with what i'm about to say which is that
01:40:08 your brain is always making predictions using your your own past experience and what you've learned
01:40:13 from you know books and movies and other people telling you about their experiences and so on
01:40:22 and if your brain cannot make a concept to make sense of those anticipate what those sense data are
01:40:28 and make sense of them you will be experientially blind so you know when i'm giving lectures to
01:40:35 people i'll show them like a blobby black and white image and they're experientially blind
01:40:43 to the image they can't see anything in it and then i show them a photograph and then i show
01:40:48 them the image again the blobby image and then they see actually an object in it but the art but the image
01:40:53 is the same yeah it's there they're actually adding their predictions now are adding right or
01:41:00 anything for example anybody who's learned a language  a second language after their
01:41:08 first language also has this experience of things that initially sound like sounds that they can't quite make sense
01:41:15 of eventually come to make they eventually come to make sense of them and in fact there are
01:41:20 really cool examples of people who are like born blind because they have cataracts
01:41:29 or they have corneal damage so that no light is reaching the brain and then they have an operation
01:41:38 and then light reaches the brain and for days and weeks and sometimes years they have they are experientially
01:41:48 blind to certain things so what happens with empathy right is that your brain
01:41:56 is making a prediction and if it doesn't if it doesn't have the capacity to um
01:42:05 make it doesn't if you don't share if you're not similar remember you mean you know categories are
01:42:11 instances which are similar in some way if you are not similar enough to that person you
01:42:17 will have a hard time making a prediction about what they feel you will be experientially blind to what
01:42:28 in the united states children of color are under prescribed medicine by their physicians this
01:42:38 is been documented it's not that the physicians are racist necessarily
01:42:53 the same thing is true of male physicians with female patients i could tell you some hair-raising stories
01:43:02 really that where people die as a consequence of a physician making the wrong inference the wrong prediction because
01:43:12 of being experientially blind you know empathy is not it's not magic it's we make inferences about each other
01:43:25 about what each other's feeling and thinking in this culture more than there are some cultures where
01:43:32 you know people have what's called opacity of mind where they will make a prediction about someone
01:43:36 else's actions but they're not inferring anything about the internal state of that person
01:43:42 but in our culture we're constantly making inferences what is this person thinking what is and we're not doing it
01:43:47 necessarily consciously but it's doing it really automatically using our predictions what we know and
01:43:56 if you expose yourself to information which is very different from somebody else i mean
01:44:03 really what we have is we have different cultures in this in this country right now that are there
01:44:08 are a number of reasons for this i mean part of it is i don't know if you saw the social dilemma the
01:44:15 the netflix  part about it yeah it's a great it's really great documentary and 
01:44:22 about what social networks are doing to our society yeah yeah but you know nothing no phenomenon has a
01:44:33 a simple single cause there are multiple small causes which all add up to a perfect storm that's
01:44:40 that's just you know how most things work and so the fact that machine learning algorithms are serving people
01:44:49 up information on social media that is consistent with what they've already viewed and making you know um
01:44:56 is part of the reason that you have these silos but it's not the only reason why you have these silos i think there
01:45:02 are other there are other things afoot that  enhance people's inability to
01:45:13 even have a decent conversation yeah i mean okay so so many things you said are just
01:45:17 brilliant so the experiment experiential blindness but also from my perspective like i i preach and i try to practice
01:45:28 empathy a lot and something about the way you've explained it makes me almost see it as a kind of
01:45:34 exercise that we should all do like to train like to add experiences to the brain to expand this capacity to
01:45:43 predict more effectively absolutely so like what like what i do is kind of like a method
01:45:48 acting thing which is i imagine what the life of a person is like you know just think i mean this is
01:45:55 something you see with black lives matter and  police officers it feels like they're both
01:46:03  not both but i have because martial arts and so on i have a lot of friends who are cops
01:46:13 have empathy or visualize the experience of the other certainly currently unfortunately people
01:46:19 aren't doing that with police officers they're not imagining they're not empathizing or putting themselves in the shoes of a
01:46:26 police officer to realize how difficult that job is how dangerous it is how
01:46:32 difficult it is to maintain calm and under so much uncertainty all this kind of thing you know but there's more there's
01:46:37 even that's all that's true but i think that there's even more there's even more to be said there i
01:46:43 mean like from a predicting brain standpoint there's even more that can be said there so i don't know if you want to go down
01:46:49 that path or you can strike on empathy but i will also say that one of the things that i was most
01:46:55 gratified by i still am receiving you know it's been three more than three and a half years since
01:47:01 how emotions are made came out and i'm still receiving daily emails from people right so that's
01:47:06 gratifying but one of the most gratifying emails i received was from police officer
01:47:14 in texas who told me that he thought contained information that would be really helpful to
01:47:28 resolving some of these difficulties and he hadn't even read my op-ed piece about when is a gun not a gun and you
01:47:36 know like using the what we know about the science of perception from predict from a prediction
01:47:43 standpoint like the brain is a predictor to understand a little differently what might be
01:47:49 happening in these circumstances so there's there's a real what's hard everyone gets mad at you when you talk
01:47:59 about this like you know and there is a way to understand this which has profound empathy
01:48:07 for the suffering of people of color and that definitely is in line with black
01:48:15 lives matter at the same time as understanding the really difficult situation that police officers
01:48:23 find themselves in and i'm not talking about this bad apple or that bad apple i'm not talking about
01:48:28 police officers who are necessarily shooting people in the back as they run away i'm talking about the cases of really good
01:48:37 well-meaning cops who have the kind of predicting brain that everybody else has
01:48:45 they're in a really difficult situation that i think both they and the people
01:48:53 who are harmed don't realize like they just the the way that these situations are constructed i think
01:48:59 it's just there's a lot to be said there i guess is what i wanted is there something we
01:49:04 can try to say in a sense like what i'm from the perspective of the predictive brain
01:49:10 which is a fascinating perspective  to take on this you know the all the protests are going on
01:49:20 there seems to be a concept of a police officer being built no i think that police i think that
01:49:25 concept is there but it's is gaining strength so it's being re-um
01:49:33 i mean yeah it is sure it is there but i think yeah for sure i think that that's right i think that there's um
01:49:41 there's a shift in the stereotype of what i would say is a stereotype there's a stereotype of
01:49:48 of  black man in this country that's always in movies and television not always but like largely
01:49:56 that many people watch i mean you know you think you're watching a 10 o'clock drama
01:50:01 and all you're doing is like kicking back and relaxing but actually you're having certain predictions reinforced
01:50:09 and others not and what's happening what's happening now with police is the same thing that there are
01:50:16 certain stereotypes of a police officer that are being abandoned and other stereotypes that are being reinforced
01:50:24 by by what you see happening all i'll say is that if you remember i mean there's a lot to
01:50:28 say about this really that you know regardless of whether it makes people mad or not i mean i just
01:50:37 i the science is what it is just remember what i said the brain is makes predictions about internal
01:50:47 changes in the body first and then motor it starts to prepare motor action and then it makes a prediction about
01:50:54 what you will see and hear and feel based on those actions okay so it's also the case that
01:51:03 we didn't talk about is that sensory sampling like your brain's ability to sample what's out there
01:51:11 is yoked to your heart rate it's yoke to your heartbeats there are certain phases of the
01:51:16 heartbeat where it's easier for you to see what's happening in the world than in others and so if your heart rate goes through
01:51:28 you will be less like you will be more likely to just go with your prediction and not correct based on what you
01:51:36 what's out there because you're actually literally not seeing as well or you will see things that aren't there basically
01:51:45 is there something that we could say in by way of advice for when this episode is released in the
01:51:57 in the chaos of  emotion sorry i don't know about a term that's just flying around on social
01:52:02 media what's well i actually think it is it is emotion in the following sense
01:52:10 you know and it sounds a little bit like artificial when i and the way i'm about to say it but i really think that this
01:52:18 is what's happening you know one thing we haven't talked about is
01:52:24 you know brains evolved didn't evolve for you to see they didn't evolve for you to hear
01:52:28 they didn't evolve for you to feel they evolved to control your body that's why you have a brain
01:52:32 you have a brain so they control your body and the metaphor the there's a the scientific term for
01:52:39 predictively controlling your body is allostasis your brain is making is attempting to it's tempting to anticipate the needs of
01:52:47 your body and meet those needs before they arise so that you can act as you need to act
01:52:54 and the metaphor that i use is a body budget you know your brain is running a budget for your body it's not budgeting money
01:53:00 it's budgeting glucose and salt and water and instead of having you know one or two bank accounts it has
01:53:07 gazillions there are all these systems in your body that have to be kept in balance and it's monitoring very closely
01:53:17 it's making predictions about like when is it good to spend and when is it good to save and what would be a good
01:53:21 investment and am i going to get a return on my investment whenever people talk about reward or
01:53:27 reward prediction error or anything to do with reward or punishment they're talking about the
01:53:33 body budget they're talking about your brain's predictions about whether or not there will be a deposit
01:53:40 or withdrawal so when you when your brain is running a deficit in your body budgets you have
01:53:51 some kind of metabolic imbalance you experience that as discomfort you experience that as distress when
01:53:59 your brain when things are chaotic you can't predict what's going to happen next so i have this
01:54:09 absolutely brilliant scientist working in my lab his name is jordan terrio
01:54:16 and he's published this really terrific paper on a sense of should like why do we have
01:54:24 social rules why do we you know adhere to social norms it's because if i make myself
01:54:31 predictable to you then you are predictable to me and if you're predictable to me
01:54:38 that's good because that that is less novelty or unpredictability at the extreme is expensive and if it goes on for long enough
01:54:51 what happens is first of all you will feel really jittery and antsy which we describe as anxiety
01:54:59 it isn't necessarily anxiety it could be just something is not predictable and you are experiencing arousal because
01:55:09 the chemicals that help you learn increase your feeling of arousal basically but if it goes on for long enough
01:55:18 you will become depleted you will start to feel really really really distressed so what
01:55:23 we have is a culture full of people right now who are their body budgets are just decimated
01:55:33 yeah and there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty when you talk about it as depression anxiety it makes you think that it's not about
01:55:44 your metabolism that it's not about your body budgeting that it's not about getting enough sleep or
01:55:49 about eating well or about making sure that you have social connections
01:55:55 it's you know it's you think that it's something separate from that but depression anxiety are just a way of
01:56:01 being in the world they're a way of being in the world when things aren't quite right with your predictions
01:56:10 that's such a deep way of thinking like the the brain is maintaining homeostasis it's actually allostational
01:56:20 stasis i'm sorry  and it's it's constantly making predictions and metabolically speaking it's very
01:56:26 costly to make novel like constantly be learning to making adjustments and then over time there's you know
01:56:33 there's a cost to be paid if you're just yeah in in in a place of chaos where there's
01:56:43 constant need for adjusting and learning and experience novel things and so part of the problem here
01:56:50 there are a couple of things like i said you know it's a perfect storm there isn't a single cause
01:56:56 right there are multiple cause multiple things that combine together it's a complex it's a complex system multiple things
01:57:04 part of it is that people are they're they're metabolically encumbered and they're distressed and in order to
01:57:11 try to have empathy for someone who is very much unlike you
01:57:19 you have to forage for information you you have to explore information that is novel to you
01:57:27 and unexpected and that's expensive and at a time when people feel what do you do when you
01:57:34 are running a deficit in your bank account you stop spending what does it mean for a brain to stop spending
01:57:43 a brain stops moving very much stops moving the body and it stops learning it just goes with
01:57:48 its internal model brilliantly put yep so empathy requires to have empathy for
01:57:55 someone who is unlike you yeah requires learning and practice you're foraging
01:58:04 for information i mean it is something i talk about in my in the book in seven and a half
01:58:09 lessons about the brain i think it's really important it's hard but it's hard i think it's you know it
01:58:16 it's hard for people to have to be curious about views that are when when they feel so encumbered
01:58:27 and i'll just tell you i had this epiphany really i was listening to robert reich's
01:58:36 the system he was talking about oligarchy versus democracy so oligarchy is where very wealthy
01:58:50 shift power so that they become even more wealthy and even more insulated and from the you
01:58:54 know the pressures of the common person it's actually the kind of system that
01:59:04 leads to the collapse of civilizations if you believe jared diamond just say that but anyways i'm listening
01:59:09 to this and i'm listening to him describe in fairly decent detail how the ceos of these companies
01:59:20 there's been a shift in what it means to be a ceo and not not being no longer being a steward of the community
01:59:26 and so on but like in the 1980s it sort of shifted to this other model of being like an oligarch
01:59:33 and he's talking about how you know it used to be the case that that ceos
01:59:41  made like 20 times  what their their employees made and now they make about 300 times on
01:59:48 average what their employees made so where did that money come from it came from the pockets of the employees
01:59:56 and they don't they don't know about it right no one knows about it they just know they can't feed their children they
02:00:03 can't pay for health care they can't take care of their family and they worry about what's going to happen
02:00:07 to their you know they're living like you know months a month basically
02:00:13 any one big bill could completely you know put them out on the street so there are a huge number of people
02:00:18 living like this so all they what their experience they don't know why they're experiencing it
02:00:22 so it's and then someone comes along and gives them a narrative yeah
02:00:28 well somebody else butted in line in front of you and that's why you're this way
02:00:34 that's why you experience what you're experiencing just for a minute i was thinking i had deep
02:00:44 empathy for people who have beliefs that are really really really different from mine but
02:00:53 i was trying really hard to see it through their eyes yeah and did it cost me something
02:01:00 metabolically i'm sure yeah i'm sure but you had something in the gas tank
02:01:07 well i in order to allocate that i mean that's the question is like where did you you what resources did your brain draw on
02:01:14 in order to actually make that effort well i'll tell you something honestly lex i don't have that much in
02:01:19 the gas tank right now right so  i i am surfing the stress that you know stress is just
02:01:29 what is stress stress is your brain is preparing for a big metabolic outlay and it just keeps preparing and preparing
02:01:35 and preparing and preparing you as a professor you as a human both right it's a for me this is a moment of existential
02:01:44 crisis as much as anybody else democracy all of these things so in many of my roles
02:01:50 so well i guess what i'm trying to say is that i get up every morning and i exercise i run
02:01:59 i row i lift weights right you exercise in the middle of the day i saw your like yeah you know daily yeah
02:02:07 i hate it actually you love it right you get it no i hate it i hate it but i do it religiously
02:02:15 yeah why because it's a really good investment it's an expenditure that is a really good investment
02:02:26 when i was exercising i was listening to the book and when i realized the insights that i was sort of like playing
02:02:31 around with like is this does this make sense does this make sense i didn't
02:02:38 immediately plunge into it i basically wrote some stuff down i set it aside and then i did what i i
02:02:44 prepared myself to make an expenditure i don't know what you do before you exercise i always have a protein shake
02:02:51 always have a protein shake because i need to fuel up before i make this really big expenditure
02:02:58 and so i did the same thing i didn't have a protein drink but i but i i did the same thing and
02:03:03 fueling up can mean lots of different things it can mean talking to a friend about it it can mean
02:03:09 you know it can it can mean get making sure you get a good night's sleep before you do it it can mean lots of
02:03:14 different things but i i guess i i think we have to do these things i  yeah that
02:03:23 this i'm gonna re-listen to this conversation several times this is brilliant 
02:03:33 you know i've encountered so many people that can't possibly imagine that a good human being can vote for donald trump
02:03:42 and i've also encountered people that can't imagine that an intelligent person can possibly vote
02:03:49 for a democrat and i i look at both these people many of whom are friends
02:03:57 and  let's just say after this conversation i can see as they're predicting brains not willing to invest
02:04:05 the resources to empathize with the other side and i think you have to in order to be able to like
02:04:14 to see the obvious common humanity in us i don't know what the system is that's creating this division
02:04:19 we can put it like you said it's a perfect storm it might be the social media might i don't know what the hell i think
02:04:25 it's a bunch of things i think it's just there's an economic system which is disadvantaging large numbers of people there's 
02:04:35 a use of social media like if you you know if i had to orchestrate or architect a system
02:04:42 that would screw up a human body budget it would be the one that we live in you know we don't sleep enough we eat
02:04:48 pseudo food basically we are on social media too much which is full of ambiguity which is really hard for
02:04:56 a human nervous system right really really hard like ambiguity with no context to predict it
02:05:00 i mean it's like really and then you know there are the economic concerns that
02:05:05 affect large swaths of people in this country i mean it's really you i'm not saying everything is
02:05:10 reducible to metabolism not everything is reducible to metabolism but
02:05:17 there if you combine all these things together it's helpful to think of it that way then somehow it's also
02:05:25  somehow reduces the entirety of the human experience the same kind of obvious logic like we should exercise
02:05:31 every day in the same kind of way we should  we should empathize every day yeah you know there are these really
02:05:39 wonderful wonderful programs for for teens and sometimes also for parents of
02:05:46 people who've lost children in in wars and in conflicts in political conflicts where they go to a bucolic setting and
02:05:52 they talk to each other about their experiences and miraculous things happen you know so um
02:06:04  you know it's easy to  it's easy to sort of shrug this stuff off as kind of
02:06:13 pollyanna-ish you know like what's this really gonna do but you have to think about
02:06:22 when my daughter went to college i i gave her advice i said  try to
02:06:30 be around people who let you be the kind you were back to free will you have a choice you have a choice it might seem like a
02:06:43 really hard choice it might seem like a unimaginably difficult choice do you have a choice
02:06:54 is wrapped in in fury and agony or do you want to be somebody who extends 
02:07:00 a little empathy to somebody else and in the process maybe learn something curiosity is the thing that it protects you
02:07:10 curiosity is the thing it's curative curiosity on social media the thing i recommend to people
02:07:18 at least that's the way i've been approaching social media i i don't it doesn't seem to be the
02:07:22 common approach but i basically  give love to people who seem to
02:07:31 also give love to others so it's the same similar concept of surrounding by yourself by the people
02:07:36 you want to become and i ignore sometimes block but just ignore i don't i don't add aggression to people who
02:07:46 are just constantly full of aggression and negativity and toxicity there's a certain desire when somebody
02:07:52 says something mean to to to say something to you know say why or try to alleviate
02:08:01 the meanness and so on but what you're doing essentially is you're and you're you're now surrounding
02:08:06 yourself by that group of folks that have that negativity so even just the conversation
02:08:14 so i you know i i think it's just so powerful to  to put yourself amongst people who are yeah who whose basic mode of
02:08:23 interaction is kindness because  i mean i don't know what it is but maybe i'm just it's the way i'm
02:08:29 built is that to me is energizing for the gas tank of
02:08:35 that that i can pull to for sure when i start reading the rise and fall of the third reich and
02:08:39 start thinking about nazi germany i can empathize with everybody involved i can start to think
02:08:47 make these difficult  like thinking that's required to understand our little planet earth well there is research to
02:08:55 back up what you said there's research that's consistent with your intuition there you know that there's research that
02:09:01 shows that being kind to other people doing something nice for someone else
02:09:10 is like making a deposit to some extent you know because i think making a deposit not only in their body
02:09:18 budgets but also in yours like people feel good when they do good things for other people
02:09:26 you know we are social animals we regulate each other's nervous systems for better and for worse right the best thing
02:09:34 for a human nervous system is another human and the worst thing for a human nervous system is another human
02:09:44 so you decide do you want to be somebody who makes people feel who who who makes people feel better
02:09:51 or do you want to be somebody who causes people pain and we are more responsible
02:10:00 for one another than we might like or then me might want but remember what we said about social reality
02:10:07 you know social reality so you you you know there are lots of different cultural  norms about  you know independence or
02:10:18 or you know collective you know nature of people but the fact is we have socially
02:10:24 dependent nervous systems we evolved that way as a species and in this country
02:10:32 we prize individual rights and freedoms and that is a dilemma that we have to grapple with and we have to do it in a
02:10:40 way if we're going to be productive about it we have to do it in a way requires engaging with each other and
02:10:50 which is what i understand the you know the founding members of this country
02:10:59  intended beautifully put let me ask a few final silly questions so one we talked a bit about love but let me
02:11:07 it's it's fun to ask somebody like you who can effectively from at least neuroscience perspective
02:11:14 disassemble some of these romantic notions but what do you make of romantic love why do
02:11:20 human beings seem to fall in love at least at least a bunch of
02:11:27 80s hair bands have written about it  is that a nice feature to have is that a bug what is it well i i'm really happy that
02:11:35 i fell in love i wouldn't want it any other way but i would say is that you the person
02:11:41 speaking or the neuroscientist well i me that's me the person speaking but  i would say
02:11:49 as a neuroscientist babies are born not able to regulate their own body budgets because their brains aren't
02:11:54 fully wired yet feed a baby when you cuddle a baby when you everything you do with a baby impacts
02:12:04 that baby's body budget and helps to wire that baby's body budget has to wire that baby's brain to manage
02:12:12 eventually her own body budget to some extent attachment humans evolved as a species
02:12:27 to be socially dependent meaning you cannot manage your body budget on your own
02:12:37 without a tax that eventually you pay many years later in terms of some metabolic illness right loneliness
02:12:46 when you break up with someone that you love or you lose them right it you feel like it's
02:12:52 going to kill you but it doesn't but loneliness will kill you it will kill you approximately you know
02:12:59 what is it seven years earlier i can't remember exactly the exact number it's it's actually in the web notes to um
02:13:05 seven and a half lessons but social isolation loneliness will kill you earlier than you would
02:13:12 otherwise die and the reason why is that you're not you didn't evolve to manage your nervous system on your own
02:13:19 and when you do you pay a little tax and that tax accrues very slightly
02:13:26 over time over a long period of time so that by the time you're in you know middle aged or a
02:13:30 little older you are more likely to die sooner from some metabolic illness from heart
02:13:38 disease from diabetes from depression you're more likely to develop alzheimer's disease i mean it's
02:13:44 the it you know it takes a long time for that tax to accrue but it does so yes i think it's a good
02:13:53 thing for people to to fall in love but i think the funny view of it is that  it's clear that humans need the social attachment
02:14:05 to  what is it manage their nervous system as as as you're describing and the reason
02:14:10 you want to stay with somebody for a long time it's so you don't have is the novelties very costly for
02:14:17  for well now you're mixing now you're mixing things now you're you know no you have to decide whether
02:14:23 but what i would say is when you lose someone you love you it feels like you've lost a part of you
02:14:32 and that's because you have you've lost someone who was contributing to your body budget we are the caretakers of one another's
02:14:40 nervous systems like it or not and out of that comes very deep feelings of
02:14:48 attachment some of which are romantic love are you afraid of  your own mortality
02:14:59 we two humans sitting here yeah do you think do you ponder your immortality i mean you're somebody who
02:15:05 thinks about your brain a lot it seems one of the more terrifying or i don't know i don't know
02:15:14 how to feel about it but it seems to be one of the most definitive aspects of life is that it ends it's a complicated
02:15:21 answer but i think the best i can do in a short snippet would be to say for a very long
02:15:27 time i did not fear my own mortality i feared the i feared pain and suffering so that that's what i feared
02:15:38 i feared being harmed or dying in a way that would be painful but i didn't fear having my life be over
02:15:50 now as a mother i i think i i have fear i fear dying before my daughter is
02:16:01 ready to be without me that's what i fear it's that's that's really what i fear and
02:16:12 frankly honestly i fear my husband dying before me much more than i fear my own death
02:16:17 there's that love and social attachment again yeah because i know i
02:16:23 it's i know it's just gonna i'm gonna feel like i wish i was dead yeah a final question about life
02:16:30  what do you think is the meaning of it all yeah i think that there isn't one
02:16:39 meaning of life there's like many meanings of life and you know you use different ones on
02:16:45 different days but for me depending on the day depending on the day but for me i would say
02:16:52 sometimes the meaning of life is to understand to make meaning actually the meaning of life is to make meaning
02:17:01 sometimes it's that sometimes it's to leave the world just slightly a little bit better
02:17:08 than it like the johnny appleseed view you know sometimes the meaning of life is um
02:17:18 to you know like clear the path for my daughter or for my students you know it's to
02:17:28 you know so sometimes it's that and sometimes it's just you know like you know
02:17:37 your moments where you're looking at the sky or you're you know by the ocean or sometimes for
02:17:45 me it's even like i'll see a you know like a weed poking out of a crack and a
02:17:52 sidewalk you know and you just have this overwhelming sense of the like wonder of
02:18:03 the of the world like the world is wondrous and you you just get very immersed in the
02:18:16 mome in the moment like the sensation of the moment sometimes that's the meaning of life i
02:18:21 don't i don't think there's one meaning of life i think it's a population of instances
02:18:25 just like  just like any other category i don't think there's a better way to end it
02:18:33 lisa the first time we spoke is i think if not the then one of i think it's the first conversation i
02:18:41 had that basically launched this pocket yeah that's actually the first conversation i've had to launch this podcast
02:18:48 and now we get to finally do it  the right way so it's a huge honor to talk to you that you spent time with me
