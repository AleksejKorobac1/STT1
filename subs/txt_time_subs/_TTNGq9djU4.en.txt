00:03:42 in master class comm / Lex to get a discount and to support this podcast and now here's my conversation with simon Sinek
00:03:52 in the infinite game your most recent book you describe the finite game in the infinite game so from my perspective of
00:04:00 artificial intelligence and game theory in general I'm a huge fan of finite games from the broad philosophical sense
00:04:07 is something that in the robotics artificial intelligence space we know how to deal with and then you describe
00:04:12 the infinite game which has no exact static rules has no well-defined static objective as the players are known
00:04:20 unknown they change there's a dynamic element so this is something that applies to business politics life itself
00:04:30 so can you try to articulate the objective function here of the infinite game or in the in the cliche broad
00:04:40 philosophical sense what is the meaning of life go for the start with a soft ball you know easy question first
00:04:50 so James Carr was the philosopher who originally articulated this concept of finite and infinite games and when I
00:04:57 learned about it it really challenged my view of how the world works right because I think we all think about
00:05:03 winning and being the best and being number one but if you think about it only in a finite game can that exist a
00:05:10 game that has fixed rules agreed upon objectives and known players like football or baseball there's always a
00:05:15 beginning middle and end and if there's a winner that has to be a loser infinite games as cars describes them as you said
00:05:22 have known and unknown players which means anyone can join it has a changeable rules which means you can
00:05:28 play however you want and the objective is to perpetuate the game to stay in the game as long as possible in other words
00:05:33 there's no such thing as being number one or winning in a game that has no finish line and what I learned is that
00:05:41 when we try to win in a game that has no finish line we try and be number we try to be the best in a game that has no
00:05:46 agreed-upon objectives or agreed-upon metrics or timeframes there's a few consistent and predictable outcomes the
00:05:53 decline of trust the decline the decline of cooperation the decline of innovation and I find this fascinating because so
00:06:01 many of the ways that we run most organizations is with a finite mindset you're trying to reduce the beautiful
00:06:07 complex thing that is life or what politics or business into something very narrow and in that process the
00:06:15 reductionist process you lose something fundamental that makes the whole thing work in the long term so returning not
00:06:24 going to let you off the hook easy what is the meaning of life so what is the objective function that is worthwhile to
00:06:32 pursue well if you think about our tombstones right they have the date we were born in the date we died but really
00:06:39 it's what we do with the gap in between there's a poem called the - you know it's the - that matters it's what we do
00:06:45 between the time we're going and the time we die that gives our life meaning and if we live our lives with a finite
00:06:51 mindset which means to accumulate more power or money than anybody else to outdo everyone else to be number one to
00:06:56 be the best we don't take any of us with us we don't take any of it with us we just die the people who get remembered
00:07:04 the way we want to be remembered is how what kind of people we were right devoted mother loving father what kind
00:07:10 of person we were to other people Jack Welch just died recently and the Washington Post when it when it wrote
00:07:18 the headline for his for his obit it wrote he pleased Wall Street and distressed employees and that's his
00:07:25 legacy of a finite player who was obsessed with winning yes who leaves behind a legacy of short-term gains for
00:07:34 a few and distress for many that's his legacy and every single one of us gets the choice of the kind of legacy one I
00:07:40 have do we want to be remembered for our contributions or a dish or our detractions to live with a finite
00:07:47 mindset to live a career with a finite mindset to be number one be the best be the most famous lay the life like Jack
00:07:57 Welch you know to live a life of service to to see those around us rise to contribute to our communities to our
00:08:02 organizations to leave them in better shape than we found them that's that's the kind of legacy most of us would like
00:08:09 to have so day to day when you think about what is the the fundamental goals dreams motivations of an infinite
00:08:23 game of seeing your life your career is an infinite game what is that what does that look like I mean I guess I'm sort
00:08:31 of trying to stick on this personal ego personal Drive the thing that the fire the reason we want to wake up in the
00:08:37 morning and everything we can't go to bed because we're so excited yeah what is that so for me it's about having a
00:08:42 just cause it's about a vision that's bigger than me that my work gets to contribute to
00:08:47 something larger than myself you know that's what drives me every day I wake up every morning with a with a vision of
00:08:54 a world that does not yet exist a world in which the vast majority of people wake up every single morning inspired
00:09:00 feel safe at work and return home fulfilled at the end of the day is not the world we live in and so that we
00:09:07 still have work to do is the thing that drives me you know I know what I know what my underlying values are you know I
00:09:12 wake up to inspire people to do the things that inspire them and these are the things that these are the things
00:09:17 that I these are my go to is my touch points that inspire me to keep working you know I think of a career like an
00:09:25 iceberg you know if you have a vision for something you're the only one who can see the iceberg underneath the ocean
00:09:32 but if you start working at it a little bit shows up and now a few other people can see what you imagined be like oh
00:09:37 right yeah no I want to help build that as well and if you have a lot of success then you have a lot of iceberg and
00:09:41 people can see this huge iceberg and they say you've accomplished so much but but what I see is all the work still yet
00:09:48 to be done yet I still see the huge iceberg underneath the ocean and so the growth you talk about momentum so the
00:09:56 incremental revealing of the iceberg is what drives you well it necessarily is incremental what drives me is that is
00:10:04 the realization is every is realizing the iceberg bringing more of the iceberg from the unknown to the known bringing
00:10:10 more of the vision from the imagination to reality and you have this fundamental vision of optimism you call yourself an
00:10:19 optimist I mean in this world I have sort of I see myself a little bit as the main character from the 88 by Dostoevsky
00:10:27 who is also kind of seen by society is a fool because he was optimistic so one can you maybe
00:10:36 articulate where that sense of optimism comes from and maybe also try to articulate your vision of the future
00:10:44 where people are inspired or optimism drives us yes it's easy to forget that when you look at social media and so on
00:10:51 with the word toxicity a negativity can often get more likes that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it and I I do hope
00:10:59 it's out there so what can you try to articulate a vision yeah so I mean for me optimism and being an optimist is is
00:11:06 just seeing the silver lining in every cloud you know even in tragedy it brings people together and the question is can
00:11:14 we see that can you see can you see the beauty that is in everything I don't think optimism is foolishness
00:11:23 I don't think optimism is blindness though it probably involves some naivete the belief that things will get better
00:11:31 the belief that that we tend towards the good even in times of struggle or bad you know you can't sustain war but you
00:11:42 can sustain peace you know I think I think things that are are stable are more sustainable things that are
00:11:49 optimistic are more sustainable than things that are you know chaotic so you see people as fundamentally good I mean
00:11:56 some people may disagree that you can't sus you can sustain peace you can't sustain war I mean you don't have to you
00:12:03 I think war is costly you know it involves life and money and peace does not involve those things it requires
00:12:10 work I'm not saying it doesn't require work but it it doesn't drain resources I think the same way that war does you
00:12:18 know the the people that would say that we will always have war and I just talked to the story and a Stalin is you
00:12:25 know would say the conflict and the desire for power and conflict is essential to human nature is sucker but
00:12:35 something in your words also perhaps it's the naive aspect that I also share is that you have an optimism that people
00:12:40 are fundamentally I'm an idealist you know I and I think idealism is good I'm not I'm not a fool
00:12:46 to believe that the ideals that I imagine can come true of course they'll never be world peace but shouldn't we
00:12:52 die trying you know I think that's the whole point that's the point of vision vision should
00:12:58 be idealistic and it should be all practical purposes impossible but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try and it's
00:13:06 the it's the milestones that we we reach that take us closer to that ideal that make us feel that our life and our work
00:13:13 have meaning and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves you know we just because it's impossible doesn't
00:13:20 mean we shouldn't try as I said we're still moving the ball down the field we're still making progress things are
00:13:25 still getting better even if we never get to that that ideal state so I think idealism is a is a good thing you know
00:13:34 in the word infinite game one of the beautiful and tragic aspects of life human life at least at least from the
00:13:42 biological perspective is that it ends so sadly into some people yo fine fine it-it's it's tragic to some people or is
00:13:51 it ends and I think some people believe that it that it ends on the day you die and some people think it continues on
00:13:56 theirs and there's a lot of different ways to think what continues on the works like but let me drag it back to
00:14:03 the personal church is  how do you think about your own mortality are you afraid of death how do you think about
00:14:11 your own death I definitely haven't accomplished everything I want to contribute to I like more time in on
00:14:19 this earth to keep working towards that vision do you think about the fact that it ends for you yeah you cognizant of
00:14:25 course I'm cognizant of it I mean not really all I I don't dwell on it I'm aware of it I know that my life is
00:14:34 finite and I know that I have a certain amount of time left on this planet and I'd like to make that time be valuable
00:14:41 you know some people would think that ideas kind of allow you to have a maybe to look around this kind of
00:14:56 question so first to push back on you said that everyone was cognizant of the mortality there's a guy named Ernest
00:15:03 Becker who would disagree that you basically say that most of human cognition is is created by us trying to
00:15:10 create an illusion and try to hide the fact that from ourselves the fact that we're gonna die to try to think that
00:15:17 we're it's all gonna go on forever but the fact that we know that it doesn't yes but this mix of denial I mean though
00:15:23 I think the book is called denial of death is this constant and now that we're running away from a that's  in
00:15:32 fact some would argue that the inspiration the incredible ideas you've put out there your TED talk has been
00:15:38 seen by millions and millions of people right it's just you trying to desperately fight the fact that you are
00:15:46 biologically immortal and to the your creative genius comes from the fact that you're trying to create ideas that live
00:15:52 on long past you well that's very nice of you I mean I I I would like my ideas to live on beyond me because I think
00:15:59 that is a good test that those ideas have value have value in the lives of others I think that's a good test that
00:16:08 that others would continue to talk about or share the ideas long after I'm gone I think is perhaps the greatest
00:16:17 compliment one can get for one's own work it's very but I don't think it's my awareness of my mortality that drives me
00:16:26 to do it it's my desire to contribute that drives me to do it this is the Optima it's the optimist vision it's
00:16:35 it's the the pleasure and the fulfillment you get from inspiring others it's just as pure as that it's a
00:16:43 let me ask listen i'm russian i'm trying to get your good and your good i'm gonna get get you into these dark areas i'm
00:16:48 enjoying it is the ego tied up into it somehow so your name is extremely well known if your name wasn't attached to it
00:16:58 do you think you would act differently i I mean for years I hated that my name was attached to it you know I had a rule
00:17:05 for years that I wouldn't have my my my face on the cover of the front page of the website you know I had a fight
00:17:12 with the publisher because I didn't want my name big on the book I wanted a tiny on the book cuz I kept telling them it's
00:17:18 not about me it's about the ideas they wanted to put my name at the top of my book I refused none of my books had my
00:17:23 names on the top because I won't I won't let them they would like very much to put my name on the top of the
00:17:29 book but the idea has to be bigger than me I'm not bigger than the idea this beautifully put do you think ego but I
00:17:36 also am aware that I've become I'm become recognized as the messenger and even though I still think the message is
00:17:42 bigger than me I recognize that I have a responsibility as the messenger and whether I like it or not is irrelevant
00:17:50 I accept I accept the responsibility I'm happy to do it I'm not sure how to phrase this but
00:17:57 there's a large part of the culture right now that emphasizes all the things that nobody disagrees with which is
00:18:07 health sleep diet relaxation meditation vacation are really important and there's no you know it's like you can't
00:18:14 really argue against that in fact people less sleep that's just I'm joking yes well that's the thing I often I often
00:18:24 speak to the fact that passion and love for you do what you're doing and the two words hard work especially in the
00:18:31 engineering fields are more important than are more important to prioritize and sleep even though sleep is really
00:18:39 important your mind should be obsessed with the hard work with the passion and so on and then I get some pushback of
00:18:45 course from people what would he make sense of that is that just me the the crazy Russian engineer really pushing
00:18:52 hard work probably we yeah I think that that's a short-term strategy I think if you sacrifice your health for the work
00:19:00 at some point it catches up with you and at some point it's like it's like going going going and you get sick your body
00:19:05 will shut down for you if you refuse to to take care of yourself you know it's you get sick it's what happens sometimes
00:19:12 you know more severe illness than something that just slows you down so I think I think taking like getting sleep
00:19:18 I mean there have been Studies on that you know executives for example who get a full night's sleep and stop at a
00:19:27 reasonable hour actually accomplish more are more productive than people who work and burn the midnight oil because their
00:19:33 brains are working better because they're well rested so you know working hard yes but what not work smart I think
00:19:44 that giving our minds and our bodies rest makes us more efficient I think just driving driving driving driving is
00:19:52 a short term so short term strategy so but to push back on that a little bit so the annoying thing is you're like a
00:19:59 hundred percent right right but the thing is it's because because you're 100% right that weak part of your mind
00:20:08 uses that fact to convince you like what so you know I I get all kinds of my mind comes up with all kinds of excuses to
00:20:15 try to convince me that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing to rationalize to rationalize and so what would I have a
00:20:22 sense we you I think what you said about executives and leaders is absolutely right but there's the early days the
00:20:29 early days of madness and passion for sure then I feel like emphasizing sleep as thinking about a sleep as giving
00:20:38 yourself away out from the fact that those early days especially is can be suffering as long it's not sustainable
00:20:47 you know right it's not sustainable sure if you're investing all that energy in something at the beginning to get it up
00:20:53 and running then at some point you're gonna have to slow down or your body will slow you down for you like you you
00:21:02 can choose your body can choose I mean so okay so you don't think from my perspective it feels like people have
00:21:07 gotten a little bit soft but you're saying no I think I think that there seems evidence that that that working
00:21:17 harder and later I've taken a back seat in it I think we have to be careful with the broad generalizations but but I
00:21:27 think in if you go into the workplace there are people who would complain that that more people now than before
00:21:34 you know look at their watches and say oops five o'clock go by night right now is that a problem with the people you're
00:21:40 saying it's the people giving themselves excuses and people don't work hard or is that the organization's aren't giving
00:21:45 them something to believe in something to be passionate about we can't manufacture passion you can't just tell
00:21:51 someone be passionate you know it's not how it works passions and output not an input like if I believe in something and
00:21:58 I want to contribute all that energy to do it we call that passion you know working hard for something we love is
00:22:03 passion working hard for something we don't care about it's called stress but we're working hard either way so I think
00:22:09 I think the organization's bears some accountability and our leaders bear some accountability which is if they're not
00:22:13 offering a sense of purpose if they're not offering us a sense of cause if they're not telling us that our work is
00:22:18 worth more than simply the money it makes then yeah I'm gonna come at five o'clock because I don't really care
00:22:23 about making you money remember we live in a world right now where a lot of people rather a few people are getting
00:22:30 rich on the hard work of others and so I think when when when people look up and say well why would I do that
00:22:36 I'll just if you're not gonna look after me and then you're gonna lay me off at the end of the year because you missed
00:22:40 your arbitrary projections you know you're gonna lay me off because you missed your arbitrary projections then
00:22:45 why would I be offer my hard work and loyalty to you so I think I don't think we can immediately blame people for
00:22:54 going soft I think we can blame leaders for their inability or failure to offer their people something bigger than them
00:23:02 making a product or making money yeah that's so that's that's brilliant and start with why leaders elast your books
00:23:10 you kind of you but you basically talk about what it what it takes to be a good leader and so some of the blame should
00:23:16 go on the leader but how much of it is on finding your passion how much is it on the individual and allowing yourself
00:23:25 to pursue that passion pushing yourself to your limits to to really take concrete steps along your path towards
00:23:33 that passion yeah there's mutual responsibility there's mutual accountability I mean we we're
00:23:38 responsible as individuals to find the organization's and find the leaders that inspire us and organizations are
00:23:43 responsible for maintaining that flame and and giving people who believe but they believed you know a chance to contribute
00:23:52 to linger on it have you by chance seen the movie whiplash yes again maybe I'm romanticizing suffering again it's the
00:24:01 Russian in you it's the Russian yeah the Russians love suffering but so but people who haven't seen it's the movie
00:24:11 whiplash as a drum instructor that pushes the drum musician to to his limits to to bring out the best in him
00:24:20 and there's a toxic nature to it and they're suffering in it like you've you've worked a lot of great leaders a
00:24:27 lot of great individuals so what is that toxic relationship as toxic as it appears in the movie or is that
00:24:33 fundamental I've seen that relationship especially in the past with Olympic athletes with especially in the Flett
00:24:41 extreme performers seem to do wonders it does wonders for me there's some of them are my best relationships now I'm not
00:24:47 representative of everyone something for some of my best relationships form auntie and mentor have been toxic from
00:24:56 an external perspective I what do you make of that movie would he make of that kind of relationship but it's not my
00:25:05 favorite movie okay so you don't think that's a healthy you don't think that kind of relationship is a great example
00:25:13 of a great short term strategy I mean short term I mean look being hard on someone is not the same as toxicity you
00:25:19 know you know if you go to the Marine Corps your drill instructor will be very hard and on their Marines and then but
00:25:29 still even on the last day of boot camp they'll take their hat off and they'll become a human but the the of all the
00:25:36 drill instructors that you know the the the fur the the three or four main but drill instructors assigned to a group of
00:25:41 recruits the one that they all want the respect of is the one that's the hardest on them that's that's true and you hear
00:25:48 you know there's plenty of stories of people who want to earn the respect of a hard parent or a hard teacher but
00:25:54 fundamental that parent that teacher that drill instructor has to believe in that person has to see potential
00:26:00 it's not it's not a formula which is if I'm hard on people they'll do well which is there has to still be love it has to
00:26:06 be done with absolute love and it has to be done with it has to be done responsibly I mean some people can take
00:26:11 a little more pressure than others but it's not I don't I think it's irresponsible to think of it as a
00:26:17 formula but that I'm just toxic at people they will they will do well it depends on their personalities first of
00:26:23 all that works for some but not all and and second of all it it can't be done willy-nilly it has to still be done with
00:26:34 with care and love and and sometimes you could get equal or better results without all of the toxicity so so one of
00:26:42 the I guess toxicity on my part was a really bad word to use but if we talk about what makes a good leader and just
00:26:50 look at an example in particular looking at Elon Musk he's known to put push people to the limits in a way that I
00:27:01 think really challenges people in a way they've never been challenged before to do the impossible sure but it can really
00:27:08 break people and and jobs was hard and and Amazon is hard and you know but the thing that's important is none of them
00:27:15 lie about it you know the you know people ask me about Amazon all the time like Jeff Bezos never lied about it you
00:27:20 know even the ones who like Amazon don't last more than a couple years before they burn out but when we're honest
00:27:26 about the culture then it gives people the opportunity who like to work in that kind of culture to choose to work in
00:27:30 that kind of culture as opposed to pretending and saying oh no this is all you know it's all lovey-lovey here and
00:27:36 then you show up and it's it's the furthest thing from it so I mean if you know I think the the reputations are
00:27:43 putting a lot of pressure on people to you know jobs jobs was not an easy man to work for
00:27:50 he pushed people but everyone who worked there was given the space to create and do things that they would not have been
00:27:55 able to do anywhere else and work at a level that they didn't work anywhere else and and jobs didn't have all the
00:28:00 answers I mean he pushed his people to to come up with answers he he he he wasn't just looking for people to
00:28:08 execute his ideas and and people did people accomplished more than they thought they were capable of which is wonderful
00:28:14 how do you you're talking about the infinite game and not thinking about to short-term and yet you see some of the
00:28:23 most brilliant people in the world being pushed by a llamas to accomplish some of the most incredible things when we're
00:28:28 talking about autopilot one we're talking about some of the hardware engineering and they they do some of the
00:28:36 best work of their life and then leave how do you balance that in terms of what it takes to be a good leader what it
00:28:43 takes to accomplish great things in your life yeah so I think there's a difference between someone who can get a
00:28:51 lot about it get a lot out of people in the short term and building an organization that can sustain beyond any
00:28:58 individual there's a difference when you say beyond any individual you mean beyond beyond like if the leader dies
00:29:04 correct like could could Tesla continue to do what it's doing without Elon Musk you know and could and you're perhaps
00:29:11 implying which is a very interesting question that he cannot I don't know you know the argument you're making of this
00:29:19 this this person who pushes everyone arguably is not a not a repeatable model right you know is Apple the same without
00:29:27 Steve Jobs or is it slowly moving in a different direction or has he established something that could be
00:29:34 resurrected with the right leader that was his dream I think it's to have or to build an organization that lives on
00:29:41 beyond them at least I remember I think that's what a lot of leaders desire which is to create something that was
00:29:48 bigger than them you know most businesses most entrepreneurial ventures could not pass the school bus test which
00:29:56 is if the founder was hit by school bus would everyone continue the business without them or were they all just go
00:30:02 find jobs and the vast majority of companies would fail that test you know in in in in especially in the
00:30:08 entrepreneurial world that if you take the inspired visionary leader away the whole thing collapses so is that a
00:30:14 business or is that just a force of personality and a lot of entrepreneurs you know face that reality which is they
00:30:20 have to be in every meeting make every decision you know come up with every idea because if they don't who will
00:30:27 and the question is well what have you done to build your bench is it it's not sometimes its ego the belief that only I
00:30:39 can sometimes it's just things got did so well for so long that just forgot and sometimes it's a failure to build the
00:30:51 training programs or or hire the right people that that could replace you who are maybe smarter and better and
00:31:00 browbeating people is only one strategy I don't think it's necessarily the only strategy nor is it always the best strategy
00:31:06 I think people people get to choose the cultures they want to work in so this is why I think I think companies should be
00:31:13 honest about the kind of culture that they've created you know I heard a story about Apple where some somebody came in
00:31:22 from a big company you know he'd accomplished a lot and has ego was very large and he was going on about how he
00:31:28 did this and he did that and he did this and he did that and somebody from Apple said we don't care what you've done the
00:31:37 question is what are you gonna do and that's that's you know for somebody who wants to be pushed that's the place you
00:31:46 go because you choose to be pushed now we all want to be pushed to some degree you know anybody who wants to yeah you
00:31:51 know accomplish anything in this world wants to be pushed to some degree whether it's through self pressure or
00:31:57 external pressure or you know public pressure whatever it is but I think this this whole idea of one size fits all is
00:32:05 a false narrative of how leadership works but what all leadership requires is creating an environment in which
00:32:10 people can work at their natural best but you have you have a sense that it's possible to create a business where it
00:32:19 lives on beyond you know fee if we look at now if we just look at this current moment I just recently talked to Jack
00:32:26 Dorsey CEO of Twitter and he's under a lot of pressure now don't know if you're aware of the news that he's being pushed
00:32:31 out as in potential as the CEO of Twitter because he's the CEO of already of an incredibly successful company plus
00:32:37 he wants to go to Africa to live a few months in Africa to to connect with the world that's outside of
00:32:45 the Silicon Valley and sort of there's this idea well can Twitter live without jack we'll find out but you have a
00:32:55 general as a student of great leadership you have a general sense that it's possible yeah of course it's possible I
00:33:00 mean what Bill Gates built with Microsoft may not have survived Steve Ballmer if the company weren't so rich
00:33:10 but such a nerd Allah is putting it back on an on track again it's become a visionary company again it's attracting
00:33:15 great talent again it went through a period where they couldn't get better the best talent and the best talent was
00:33:19 leaving now people want to work for Microsoft again well that's not because of pressure Ballmer put more pressure on
00:33:26 people mainly to hit numbers than anything else that didn't work yes right and so the question is what kind of
00:33:33 pressure are we putting on people we're putting on pressure people to hit numbers or hit hit arbitrary deadlines
00:33:39 or putting on pressure on people because we believe that they can do better work and the work that we're trying to do is
00:33:45 to advance a vision that's bigger than all of us and if you're gonna put pressure on people it better be for the
00:33:50 right reason like if you're gonna put pressure on me it better be for a worthwhile reason if it's just to hit a
00:33:55 goal if it's just to hit some arbitrary date or some arbitrary number or make a stock price hit some target you can keep
00:34:00 it I'm out of here yes but if you want to put pressure on me because we are are we are brothers
00:34:07 and sisters-in-arms working to advance a cause bigger than ourselves that we believe whatever we're gonna build will
00:34:12 significantly contribute to the greater good of society then go ahead I'll take the pressure and if you look at the
00:34:20 apples and you look at the the the the the the Elon Musk's you know the jobs in the Elan musk they fundamentally believe
00:34:26 that what they were doing would improve Society and and it was for the good of humankind and so the pressure in other
00:34:35 words the the the what they were doing was more important more valuable than any individual in the team and so the
00:34:41 pressure they put on people served a greater good and so we we we we looked to the left and we looked to the right
00:34:47 to each other and said we're in this together we accept this we want this but if it's just pressure
00:34:57 to hit a number or you know make the widget and move a little faster yeah and that's soul-sucking that's not
00:35:07 passion that's stress and I think a lot of leaders confuse that making people work hard is not what makes them
00:35:16 passionate giving them something to believe in and work on is what drives passion and when you have that then
00:35:25 turning up the pressure only brings people together Dresden if I've done the right way done
00:35:30 the right way speaking of pressure thank you I'm gonna give you 90 seconds to answer the last
00:35:38 question which is if I told you that tomorrow was your last day to live and talk about mortality sunrise to sunset
00:35:45 can you tell me can you take me through the day what do you think that day would involve you can't spend it with your
00:35:52 family oh joy as well I would probably want to fill all of my senses with things that excite my senses I'd want to
00:36:01 look at beautiful art I want to listen to beautiful music I'd want to taste incredible food I'd want to smell
00:36:08 amazing tastes I'd want to touch you know something that you know something that's beautiful to touch I'd want all
00:36:19 of my senses to just be consumed with with things that I find beautiful and you talked about this idea of we don't
00:36:25 do it often these days they're just listening to music turning off all the devices and actually taking in and
00:36:32 listening to music so as a addendum before it to talk about music what song would you be blasting in this last day
00:36:39 you're alive let's zap 'ln what do we hope that I love no no there's probably going to be a Beatles song in there
00:36:44 that'll definitely be some Beethoven in there the classics the clown guy yeah exactly thank you so much for talking to you
00:36:53 thank you for making time for it under pressure we made a hat it was great thanks for listening to this
