00:00:02 tesla is today the most valuable automaker in the world by market capitalization beating out industry giants like general
00:00:09 motors ford volkswagen group and even toyota it has achieved this impressive feat despite a short operating history
00:00:16 a limited product lineup and even relatively modest sales figures compared to these much more established
00:00:21 entities in spite of all of these indicators though investors are willing to pay more than
00:00:26 five times as much for the same stake in tesla as compared with more traditional automakers so what is going on here
00:00:33 what do investors see in tesla that a rational person might not what is the company's vision
00:00:40 to truly justify being valued this highly and could this all be a charismatic ceo taking a pool of naive investors
00:00:48 for a ride oh and of course before we start answering these questions we need to give the standard disclaimer
00:00:53 that we do for all company videos and that is that nobody on the economics explain team currently owns any tesla
00:00:59 shares or stock options so even though we would want to remain impartial either way
00:01:05 now you know this episode of economics explained was made possible by our fans on patreon
00:01:09 if you would like to gain early access to these videos before they're uploaded to youtube as well as participate in
00:01:14 exclusive q a sessions which are now held every saturday at 9 30 eastern standard time
00:01:18 please consider supporting our channel at patreon.com economics explained toyota by most metrics
00:01:26 is the largest car company in the world they produce the most cars they make the most revenue
00:01:31 employ the most people and have a long tenured history with brand recognition and a base of loyal customers
00:01:37 that probably spans even further than they would actually like it to by comparison tesla sells 130th as many cars
00:01:45 makes less than 10 of the revenue and oh yeah hemorrhages money every year it operates 2019 was actually considered a good year
00:01:53 as far as finances go because it only lost 862 million dollars which was an improvement from the year
00:02:02 four where it lost 1 billion despite this toyota has a market capitalization of just under 200 billion dollars
00:02:09 whereas tesla is more than double this runner-up sitting at a valuation of over
00:02:15 400 billion so the first thing to know here is that market capitalizations are sometimes a bit
00:02:21 misleading this number is calculated by taking the market price of a stock and then multiplying it by the total
00:02:27 number of stocks there are currently just under 1 billion tesla shares in existence so if we multiply that by the 430
00:02:35 market price we get ourselves a market capitalization figure now the market price is something that
00:02:40 can jump around quite a lot for any number of reasons that are completely divorced from the underlying
00:02:45 fundamentals of the company amateur investor hype stock buybacks easy access to capital price
00:02:51 manipulating tweets to commit securities fraud all that good stuff can push the share price up or down
00:02:59 without actually making the company they reflect any larger or smaller or more prosperous all of these factors are common
00:03:06 criticisms leveled at tesla but supporters will point to the fact that building cars
00:03:12 is just one small part of scaling up the tesla empire one of the most telling insights into
00:03:17 the difference between tesla and regular automakers is to look at their subsidiaries
00:03:23 regular automakers have grown their influence by buying up other car brands volkswagen is a great
00:03:28 example of this volkswagen group is not only responsible for the people's car but they also own a
00:03:34 part or all of bentley audi bugatti porsche sia lamborghini skoda
00:03:39 as well as a collection of commercial vehicle manufacturers tesla by contrast is a company that
00:03:44 still owns other companies but it takes a slightly different approach to its mergers and acquisitions
00:03:51 instead of buying up competitors it owns companies within its own supply chain which allows it to not only be a car
00:03:57 manufacturer but also a component supplier a dealership a fuel station energy generator and
00:04:04 maybe even one day a transport provider all of its own now these two different approaches all
00:04:11 hope to achieve the same two things increase revenue and decrease costs which results in increased profits
00:04:18 business 101 right but here's how they do it a company like volkswagen is investing
00:04:23 in what is known as a horizontal integration i.e they are investing in businesses on the same level of the production
00:04:30 process as their own porsche and volkswagen are companies that technically do the same thing
00:04:35 they take raw materials and component parts and turn them into cars before selling them off to dealership
00:04:41 networks now just because all of these car companies do the same thing doesn't mean that
00:04:45 there aren't huge advantages to teaming up companies like volkswagen will build cars on similar platforms and share them between
00:04:53 all of their brands the volkswagen tiguan audi q7 porsche cayenne bentley bentayga and even the lamborghini urus all share
00:05:00 the same basic chassis and components this achieves the two things that the
00:05:05 business wanted to do it increases revenue because suddenly the manufacturer can appeal to all
00:05:09 manner of different buyers with effectively the same car an average family gets the base model
00:05:16 volkswagen a wealthier family will buy a porsche or an audi and for the people that want a truly ostentatious display
00:05:20 of wealth there are the bentleys and lamborghinis that cost six times as much
00:05:26 for effectively the same car this means that volkswagen will draw revenue from buyers that don't want to consider
00:05:32 a car from the other end of the spectrum either because it's far too expensive or far too povo this technique of shared platforms
00:05:40 also reduces costs because research and development as well as manufacturing overheads are shared between
00:05:46 all of the brands it would be cost prohibitive for a boutique manufacturer like bentley
00:05:51 to invest the same amount of money into developing a new drivetrain modern cars require huge teams of
00:05:57 engineers designers and lawyers to make sure that cars comply with all the various road laws around the
00:06:03 world while also being a good car and yes yes i know there are boutique manufacturers out there that do pull
00:06:09 this off without being beholden to some corporate overlord but just remember those cars tend to be
00:06:15 extremely expensive even by bentley and lamborghini standards and they probably lack the
00:06:21 day-to-day reliability as well i mean i don't know patreon.com so maybe one day i can find out
00:06:27 now tesla takes this expansion concept and turns it on its head literally it does what is called
00:06:31 vertical integration where instead of buying up competitors in the same step of the production process
00:06:38 it buys up or creates businesses that cover other parts of the process tesla's largest investment has not been into the
00:06:45 cars themselves but rather into component manufacturing recharging stations and owning their own dealership networks
00:06:51 all steps in the process of selling a car that traditional manufacturers have left to other companies this
00:06:58 achieves the same two goals it reduces expenses because you don't have to include profit markups for all
00:07:03 of the different steps of the process for example if audi sells a car to a dealership they are going to sell it at
00:07:09 a wholesale price and then that dealer will add a markup to the consumer to make their own profits by owning this
00:07:14 entire process tesla can cut out those middlemen it also increases revenue
00:07:21 by offering additional revenue sources tesla really only makes three cars at the moment
00:07:28 the model s the model 3 and the model x we have just seen that the volkswagen group has a wider selection of products
00:07:35 within just one chassis but in the same way that volkswagen increased revenue by offering lots of different types of cars
00:07:41 to lots of different types of people tesla is offering lots of different services to the same types of people
00:07:47 if you buy a new porsche then go fill it up down the road volkswagen is not seeing any revenue from the sale of that
00:07:54 gasoline whereas if you buy a new tesla and go charge it at the company's supercharger network they will
00:07:59 the same is true for a lot of other areas as well a byproduct of making electric cars with an emphasis on vertical
00:08:06 integration is that tesla has become really good at making batteries the same tree hugging tech bro that will
00:08:11 inevitably buy tesla may very well buy a house with a battery pack as well
00:08:17 meaning that again they have made money outside of just being one of the many moving parts in the auto industry
00:08:24 so increase revenue and decrease costs to make more profit simple formula with two very different
00:08:29 approaches from established automakers and tesla respectively the only problem is that as innovative
00:08:35 as tesla's fresh new approach may seem it hasn't really worked they haven't made any profit
00:08:41 to the contrary they are losing money but maybe that's okay because they haven't yet achieved the magic solution to all
00:08:48 business woes economies of scale economies of scale is a phenomenon in production
00:08:54 where the unit cost of goods trends downwards as more items are made this phrase tends to get thrown around
00:09:01 pretty loosely but it's actually a lot more complex than what most people think there are three main reasons why this happens
00:09:09 mitigation of fixed costs efficiencies and scale and negotiating power say you were tasked with building just
00:09:15 one car if push came to shove you could probably do it but most of you watching would
00:09:20 need to go to school to learn how to put a car together and you would also need to buy a whole lot of equipment to
00:09:26 actually manufacture that car this education and a workshop full of tools would cost
00:09:30 hundreds of thousands of dollars and take years of your time to put together if you were to turn around and sell that
00:09:36 car at a price that was commensurate with your outlay and effort and that would be an astronomically expensive vehicle
00:09:42 easily hundreds of thousands of dollars but now let's say you were tasked with building two cars
00:09:48 well you wouldn't need to go back to school to learn to build another car and you could just use the same tools
00:09:54 all over again in this example the tools and education are the fixed costs no matter how many
00:09:58 cars are made you don't need to spend any more on these and as more and more cars are
00:10:03 produced they reflect a smaller and smaller fraction of the total cost involved in making
00:10:11 that car the next big step is scale hand tools and a garage workshop are great but
00:10:15 even with the most skilled mechanic in the world it is going to struggle to put a card together
00:10:20 from scratch in less than a month a full-on assembly line on the other hand well that's a different beast now tasks
00:10:27 can be broken down into very easy very repetitive actions that might not require an education at all
00:10:32 what's more is if they do exactly the same thing day in and day out you get very very good at it
00:10:37 inherently making production much more efficient finally if you are ordering a single piece of every
00:10:43 component that goes into a car you're going to be paying retail price for those parts but
00:10:48 if you are ordering hundreds of thousands of components at a time or even better yet manufacturing them
00:10:54 in-house you are going to pay much less for them this lowers the variable costs of production
00:11:00 so all in all it's looking like a pretty big win for the economies of scale it mitigates fixed costs increases
00:11:05 output and reduces variable costs what's not to love it's pretty easy to graph out this process
00:11:11 and see that cost competitiveness will naturally favor those who produce the most so sure maybe teslas are a bit too
00:11:18 expensive for most consumers today as we saw earlier they only make 1 30 at the number of cars that toyota does
00:11:25 as soon as they expand into making a few million cars a year they will have the magic economies of
00:11:29 scale on their side and be super profitable right well maybe but probably not as fantastic
00:11:36 as the economies of scale effect looks it has a dark side you see this chart here
00:11:42 is not actually complete it is supposed to look more like this in typical manufacturing after a
00:11:47 certain point producing more goods starts to cost more and more
00:11:54 this is caused by a reverse of the reasons that we saw all the components getting cheaper in the first place
00:12:00 those fixed costs for starters either a would-be manufacturer is going to have to try and squeeze more and more out of
00:12:05 their existing factory or workshop or whatever or they are going to need to open up a second location to keep making more cars
00:12:12 this is a huge jump in fixed costs that will need to be shared amongst the costs associated with each individual car
00:12:18 after that the same thing happens with breaking down processes into smaller and smaller tasks
00:12:24 one man building an entire car by hand is not very efficient a team working on set steps is efficient
00:12:31 but a huge team of thousands of people each responsible for one single screw or weld is just as
00:12:36 inefficient as having one person doing the whole thing eventually people will just get in each
00:12:41 other's way and finally that bulk discount turns into clearing out entire markets
00:12:49 if you want to buy 10 000 glass windows you get a bulk discount if you want to buy 10 million you force
00:12:55 demand up so high that prices will naturally increase call it a personal vendetta of mine
00:13:01 but the loose way that people throw around the idea of economies of scale being the secret ingredient to every business
00:13:08 is potentially harmful in choosing good quality companies to invest in this should probably be the key takeaway
00:13:14 of the video but nobody will click on a video called the negative marginal cost minimization in high output production
00:13:20 so you know haha i tricked you into learning but maybe we have been a bit too cynical
00:13:25 here and missed the point of tesla entirely most institutional investors agree that a 400 billion valuation for a car company
00:13:33 even one with all of its vertical integration is absolutely ludicrous especially considering all the
00:13:40 factors we've already explored but maybe tesla is not a car company at all i mean sure it builds cars but not many
00:13:49 of them and they are really only a means to an end of efficiently getting people from
00:13:53 place to place what is much more exciting especially to investors is the final step of the
00:13:59 company's plan to control everything related to road based transport the idea of car ownership
00:14:06 itself tesla is quite famously developing systems for self-driving cars right now these systems are little more
00:14:11 than a cool party trick but they have some much more serious long-term potentials
00:14:18 it could become their very own transport network taxi companies and uber drivers make money by purchasing vehicles
00:14:25 and using them to transport passengers which means that there is more money to be made in moving people about
00:14:31 than simply selling a car as a one-time transaction even a range-topping tesla model x sells for under a hundred thousand dollars in
00:14:37 the us today which is obviously a lot of money but that same
00:14:43 car if let loose to act as its very own uber driver could make hundreds of thousands of dollars before
00:14:47 eventually being retired elon musk has already spoken quite freely about a future
00:14:53 where nobody owns a car which would be very unusual rhetoric for a car company ceo had it not been for this
00:15:00 more holistic approach to a transport solution now what investors hope this means is that tesla is more of a
00:15:07 tech company that just so happens to make cars rather than a car company that just has
00:15:12 some cool tech technology has the advantage of being able to achieve the aforementioned
00:15:17 economies of scale far more efficiently than other types of businesses like retail
00:15:23 oil and gas healthcare pharmaceuticals and yes of course even auto manufacturing that's why today seven of the top 10
00:15:29 most valuable companies in the world are tech companies so the cynical analysts are right
00:15:36 tesla the car manufacturer is not worth even a fraction of the 400 billion evaluation but a company that proposes to be the
00:15:44 world leader in renewable energy storage a replacement to gas companies and a cheaper alternative to uber all in one
00:15:51 well that's a more intriguing proposition especially when you consider that well yeah they do make really cool cars
00:15:59 i definitely want one hi guys i hope you enjoyed the latest video if you did please consider liking and subscribing
