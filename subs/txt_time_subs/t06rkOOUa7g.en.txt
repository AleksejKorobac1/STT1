00:00:01 the following is a conversation with manolis kellis his second time on the podcast he's a
00:00:06 professor at mit and head of the mit computational biology group
00:00:11 he's one of the most brilliant productive and kind people i've had the fortune of talking to a lot
00:00:17 of my colleagues at mit and former mit faculty and students wrote to me after our first conversation with some
00:00:23 version of minos is awesome isn't he i'm glad you guys are not friends
00:00:31 i am too and i'm happy that he makes time in his insanely busy schedule to sit down and have a chat with me

00:00:45 in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast as a side note let me say that i just
00:00:51 got back from talking to joe rogan on his podcast my fifth time on there i also got a
00:00:56 chance to record a separate conversation with joe on this podcast we talked on both quite
00:01:00 a bit about his journey and his advice for mine one of the things that i think made his
00:01:07 show special is that he just had fun and made choices that didn't get in the way of him having fun
00:01:14 and loving life i'm learning to do just that it's tough since i'm naturally full of self-doubt and
00:01:21 anxiety but i'm learning to let go and have fun even if my monotone robotic voice
00:01:28 sometimes sounds otherwise for joe that involved talking to his friends comedians
00:01:33 especially ones that brought out the best in him duncan trussell and the five-hour first episode on
00:01:39 spotify comes to mind is an example of that duncan has been a guest probably close to if not more than 50 times on joe's podcast
00:01:48 my hope with amazing people like manolas is to find my duncan trussell my joey diaz and yes even my
00:01:56 eddie bravo obviously joe and i are very different people but ultimately both love life when we can interact
00:02:03 often with people we love and who inspire us make us smile make us think and make us
00:02:09 have fun when we get behind the mic of a podcast whether anyone is listening or not if you enjoy this thing

00:03:04 an online store for basic health and household stuff their products have a minimalist black
00:03:09 and white design that i find to be just clean elegant and beautiful it goes nicely at least i think so
00:03:16 with the design of crew dragon and the recent spacex nasa mission that sent two humans into space to me
00:03:24 very few things are as inspiring as us humans reaching out into the unknown the harsh challenges of space
00:03:31 colonizing mars may not have obvious near-term benefits but i believe it will challenge our
00:03:35 scientists and our engineers to create technologies whose impact will be immeasurable
00:03:41 for us humans here on earth or those of us who choose to stay here on earth personally

00:06:18 and now here's my conversation with manolas kalas what is beautiful about the human epigenome don't get me started so first of all as
00:06:28 an engineering feat the human epigenome manages the most compact the most incredible compaction you could imagine
00:06:39 so every single one of your cells contains two meters worth of dna and this is compacted
00:06:46 in a radius which is one thousandth of a millimeter that's six orders of magnitude to give you a
00:06:52 sense of scale it's as if a string as tall as the burj al khalifa
00:06:59 which is about a kilometer tall was compacted into a tiny little ball and if you put it all together if you
00:07:10 stretch the trillions of cells that we have we have about 30 trillion cells in your body if you
00:07:15 stretch the dna the 2 meters worth of dna in every one of your trillion cells you would basically reach all the way to jupiter
00:07:27 a hundred times yeah it's all curled up in there it's 30 trillion cells 30 trillion
00:07:33 human body every one of them two meters worth of dna so all of that is compacted through the epigenome
00:07:40 the epigenome basically has the ability to compact this massive amount of dna from here to
00:07:47 jupiter 10 times into one human body into just the nuclei of one human body and the vast majority of human bodies
00:07:51 not even these nuclei and that's sort of the structural part
00:07:56 so that's the boring part that's the structural part the functional part is way more interesting so functionally
00:08:03 what the human epigenome allows you to do is basically control the activity patterns of thousands of genes
00:08:13 so 20 000 genes in your human body every one of your cells only needs a few thousand of those but a different
00:08:18 few thousand of those and the way that your cells remember what their identity is is basically driven
00:08:26 by the epigenome so the epidural is both structural in sort of making this dramatic compaction and it's also functional
00:08:33 in being able to actually control the activity patterns of all your cells now can we draw
00:08:41 a definition distinction between the genome and the epigenome again being greek epi means on top of
00:08:50 so the genome is the dna and the epigenome is anything on top of the dna
00:08:56 and there's you know three types of things on top of the dna the first is chemical modifications on
00:09:00 the dna itself so we like to think of four bases of the dna acgt
00:09:07 c has a methyl form which is sometimes referred to as the fifth base so methylc takes a different meaning
00:09:15 so in the same way that you have annotations in a orchestra score that basically say whether you should play something softly
00:09:24 or loudly or space it out or you know interpret basically the score the human epigenome allows you to modify
00:09:32 that primary score so a modified c basically says play this one softly it's basically a sign of repression
00:09:41 in a gene regulatory region i love how you're talking about the function that emerges from the epigenome as a musical score
00:09:51 it is in many ways and  every single cell plays a different part of that score it's like having all of human knowledge
00:09:58 in 23 volumes like 23 giant books which are your chromosomes and every single cell has a different profession
00:10:04 a different role some cells play the piano and they're looking at chapter seven from chromosome 23 and chapter four from
00:10:11 chromosome two and so forth and each of those  pieces are all encoding in the same dna
00:10:19 but what the epigenome allows you to do is effectively conduct the orchestra and sort of coordinate the pieces so
00:10:27 that every instrument plays only the things that it needs to play one thing that kind of blows my mind
00:10:32 maybe you can tell me your thoughts about it is the the way evolution works with natural selection
00:10:40 is  based on the final sort of the entirety of the orchestra musical performance right and then but
00:10:48 there's these incredibly rich structural things like each one of them doing their own
00:10:56 little job that somehow work together like the evolution selects based on the final result and yet all the individual pieces are
00:11:03 doing like infinitely minuscule specific things how the heck does that work
00:11:09 right it's a very good insight and you can even go beyond that and basically say evolution doesn't
00:11:13 select at the level of an organism it actually selects at the level of whole environments whole ecosystems
00:11:21 so let me break this down so you basically have at the very bottom every single nucleotide
00:11:28 being selected but then that nucleotides function is selected at the level of you know each gene
00:11:36 and every not even its gene each gene regulatory control element and then those control elements are basically converging
00:11:43 onto the function of the gene and many genes are converging onto the function of one cell
00:11:47 and many cells are converging into the function of one tissue or organ and all of these organs are converging
00:11:53 onto the level of an organism but now that organism is not in isolation
00:12:00 so if you basically think about why is altruism for example a thing why are people being nice to
00:12:05 each other it was probably selected and it was probably selected
00:12:11 because those species that were just nasty to each other didn't survive as a species and now if
00:12:17 you think about symbiosis of you know there's plants for example
00:12:25 that love co2 and there's humans that love o2 and we're sort of you know
00:12:32 trading different types of gases to each other if you look at ecosystems where one organism which is
00:12:41 really nasty that organism actually died because everyone they were being nasty to was
00:12:46 killed off and then that kind of you know universe of life is gone so basically
00:12:54 what emerges is selection at so many different layers of benefit including
00:13:04 you know all of these nucleotides within a body interacting for the emergent functions
00:13:11 at the body level yeah i wonder i wonder if it's possible to break it down into levels that's
00:13:16 selection even beyond humans like you said environment but there's environments at all different levels too right
00:13:23 at the minuscule at the organ level the tissue level like you said maybe at the microscopic level it would
00:13:27 be fascinating if like there's a kind of selection going on at like both the quantum level and like the
00:13:36 the galaxy level yeah yeah right yeah so so all the different forms yeah let's again sort of break down
00:13:40 these different layers so basically if you think about the environment in which a gene operates that gene of
00:13:45 course the first definition of environment that we think of is pollution
00:13:52 or sunlight or heat or cold and so forth that's the external environment but every gene also operates
00:13:57 at the level of the internal cellular environment that it's in if i take a gene from say an african
00:14:03 individual and i put it in a european context will it perform the same way probably not because there's a cellular context
00:14:12 of thousands of other genes that that gene has co-evolved with you know in the out of africa event and
00:14:18 you know all of this sort of human history of evolution so basically if you look at neandertal
00:14:26 genes for example which again happened long after that  out of africa event
00:14:32 there's incompatibilities between neanderthal genes and modern human genes that can lead to diseases
00:14:39 so in the context of the neonatal genome that gene version that allele was fine but in the context of the modern human
00:14:46 genome that neanderthal gene version is actually detrimental so it's it's you know that cellular environment
00:14:53 constitutes the genetics of that gene but also of course all of the epigenomics of that gene it's
00:14:58 fascinating that the the gene has a history i mean we talked about this a little bit last time but
00:15:05 just and and then some of your research goes into that but the genes as they are today have have a story
00:15:14 from the beginning of time and then some sometimes their story was like their path was useful
00:15:20 for survival for the particular organisms and sometimes not that's fascinating let me ask as a tangent
00:15:28 we kind of started talking offline about neanderthals  do you have something interesting
00:15:33 genetically biologically in terms of difference between  neanderthal and like the different branches of human
00:15:41 evolution that you find fascinating neanderthals are only one of about five branches
00:15:48 that we are pretty confident about one branches of of out of africa events so basically
00:15:54 there's neanderthals there's denisovans what is the evidence for denisovans
00:16:02 one tiny little fragment of one pinky from one cave in siberia recent relatively recently discovered
00:16:09 right less than 10 years ago yeah and those are like little folks right no no no no no that's yet another one
00:16:14 though homo florences it had the little folks in sort of indonesia but then
00:16:20  denisovans are basically another branch that we only know about genetically from that one bone and eventually
00:16:26 we realize that it's one of the three major branches along with neanderthal modern human
00:16:32 and denisovan and then that one branch has now resurfaced in many different areas and we kind of know about the gene
00:16:38 flow that happened in between them so when i was reading my greek mythology it was talking about the age of the heroes
00:16:46 these eras of human like you know precursors that were wiped out by zeus or by all kinds
00:16:52 of wars and so forth like the titans and the you know it's it's ridiculous to sort of
00:16:57 read these stories as a kid because you're like oh yeah whatever and then you're growing up and you're like whoa
00:17:03 layers and layers of human-like ancestors and who knows if those stories were inspired by bones that they found that
00:17:10 kind of looked human-like but were not quite human-like who knows if stories of dragons were inspired by
00:17:16 bones of dinosaurs basically this archaeological evidence has been there
00:17:22 and has probably entered the folk imagination migrated into those stories but it's not that far you know removed from what
00:17:28 actually happened of massive wars of wiping out neanderthals as humans are modern humans are
00:17:35 populating you know europe do you think do you think what killed the neanderthals
00:17:42 and all those other branches is human conflict or is it genetic conflict so is it  us humans being
00:17:49 the opposite of altruistic towards each other or is it  some other
00:17:56  competition at some other level like as we're discussing yeah so if you look at a lot of human
00:18:01 traits today they're probably not that far removed from the human traits that got us where
00:18:05 we are now so you know this whole tribalism you know your my sports team or
00:18:13 your my you know political party or you're my you know tiny little village and therefore
00:18:19 you know if you're from that other village i hate you but as soon as we're both in the major city i can't believe we're
00:18:27 from the same region my friend come and like two neighboring countries fighting and as soon as they're off in
00:18:31 another country they're like oh i can't believe that right so it's it's kind of funny like this
00:18:37 tribalism is nonsensical in many ways it's like cognitive incongruent that basically we like
00:18:44 kin and selection for for sort of liking kin is hugely advantageous genetically
00:18:51 probably across all kinds of organs all across all kinds of life yeah so so basically if you now
00:18:55 transport that to the sort of humans arriving in europe and neanderthals are everywhere
00:19:03 what are you going to do you're going to kill them off you know there's this battle for territory
00:19:09 and these battle for they're not like us we have to get rid of them so basically there's a you know very
00:19:15 interesting mix there but and yet and yet when you look at the genetics there's tons of gene flow between them
00:19:23 so basically you know love romance between you know tribes but love   spans
00:19:30  the gap between the different tribes it's wrong julia it's across species boundaries even before the out of africa there's
00:19:41 you know within africa's election which was probably massive battles of larger and larger tribes
00:19:49 selecting for our social networking and savviness and  you know probably all our conspiracy theory
00:19:57 genes or you know dating back from then and you know it's so there's a lot of this mischievousness
00:20:04 in the history of human evolution that unfortunately still present in you know many ugly forms today
00:20:11 but probably contributed to our success as a species in wiping out other species it just
00:20:16 sucks that  we don't have neighboring species that are you know intelligent like us
00:20:26 that but yet very different than us so we have like you know dogs or wolves i guess
00:20:32  co-evolved they they figured out how to  neighbor up with humans in a friendly way and collaborate and
00:20:41 it develop into describing this as if the wolves made a choice it's possible that the wolves never had
00:20:47 to say that basically humans were just so overpowering that they had captive wolves and then at every generation killed off
00:20:55 eight of the nine pups and only kept the one that was milder ah humans it only takes a few generations
00:21:00 to then sort of have pups that are really mild and so the neanderthals weren't useful
00:21:08 in the same way i don't know if it's a question of useful they were probably super useful
00:21:14 my thinking is that they were scary that basically something that almost resembles you
00:21:20 yeah is something that you try to eliminate first it's too close yeah and  speaking of
00:21:26 you know species that are intelligent and sort of what's left of evolution it is a shame
00:21:32 exactly like you say that so many different amazing life forms were extinct
00:21:40 and the kind of boring ones remained so if you look at dinosaurs i mean the diversity that they had if you look at sub you
00:21:47 know like there's just so many different lineages of life that were just abruptly killed
00:21:57 and yet out of that death emerged you know many new kinds of really awesome lineages do you think there was
00:22:02 in the history of life on earth species that may be still alive today
00:22:08 that are more intelligent than humans and we just don't know it's also made for dolphins like if you
00:22:13 look at their brains if you look at the way that they play if you look at the way that they learn
00:22:18  you know i mean they don't have possible thumbs and we do so you know that probably made a big
00:22:23 difference it's terrifying to think that like not terrifying i don't know how to feel about it that they're more intelligent
00:22:27 than us it's like a hitchhiker's guide i know but how do you define intelligence
00:22:34 basically like i was saying last time you know stupid is a stupid does and smart is a smart does so
00:22:41 yeah if the dolphins are basically super smart figure out the meaning of life and just go around playing with water all day
00:22:50 then we wouldn't know because all they're doing is kicking water just like sharks are and sharks are probably
00:22:54 pretty stupid so so basically it's very difficult to sort of
00:22:59 judge a species intelligence unless you they kind of go out of their way to demonstrate it
00:23:05 yeah and that's instructive for our understanding of any kind of life form  you know i recently talked to sarah
00:23:11 seeger looking for life out there on other planets it'd be fascinating to think
00:23:19 if we discover a habitable planet that's you know outside of earth in one day maybe many centuries away or be able to travel
00:23:26 with like a robot there how would we actually know that this species would probably be able
00:23:33 to detect that it's a living being but how would we know if it's an intelligent being
00:23:41 i mean  it's both exciting and terrifying to sort of come face to face with a life form that's of another world
00:23:51 like something that clearly is moving in a how would you say like a deliberate way
00:23:58 and to then like ask well how do i ask that thing with it whether it's intelligent no but
00:24:04 the the question that you're asking is applicable to every species on on the earth on earth now
00:24:10 yeah so basically you know dolphins are a great example we know that they're you know clearly capable hardware wise
00:24:16 and behavior-wise of intelligence you know how do we communicate so basically if your question is about
00:24:23 crossing species boundaries of communication the way that i want to put it is that humans have achieved
00:24:33 a level of sophistication in our behaviors in our communication in our language in our ways of expressing ourselves
00:24:42 that i have no doubt that if we encounter the human-like form of intelligence we'd figure out their language
00:24:49 in a few weeks like it'd be just fine as long as you know of course they're both trusting each other not
00:24:54 annihilating each other and not sort of fearing each other and attacking each other what about
00:25:00 the message just out of curiosity into science fiction land a little bit if so  clearly you're one of the top
00:25:06 scientists in the world so if we were to discover an alien life form  you would be brought in to study his genetics
00:25:17 do you think the epigenome that we talked about the genome the code the digital code that underlies
00:25:24 that alien life form would be similar to ours like the in in fundamental ways maybe not exactly but
00:25:31 in fundamental ways of how it's structured yeah so so you're getting to the very definition of
00:25:36 life you're getting to the very definition of what what makes life life and how do we decode that life and it's so easy to
00:25:45 think that every life form would basically have to you know like oxygen has to have to like
00:25:52 heat from the sun and rely on sort of being in the habitable zone of you know its solar system and so forth
00:26:01 but i think we have to sort of go beyond this sort of oh life on another planet must be exactly like life is on earth
00:26:09 because of course life on earth happens to rely on the proximity to the sun and benefit from that amount of energy
00:26:15 but we're talking at time scales of human life where we kind of live i don't know
00:26:23 between and i'm going to be super wide here we're going we're going to live between six earth months and
00:26:30 you know 200 a month earth months or 200 earth years so basically if you look at the time scale
00:26:36 that we inhabit on earth it is very much dictated by the amount of energy that we receive from the sun
00:26:43 if you look at i don't know europa you know the smallest the fourth smallest moon of jupiter the smallest of the
00:26:50 galilean moons and also the smallest it has an iron core it has a rock exterior it has ice all around it
00:27:05 and it has probably massive liquid oceans underneath and the gravitational pull the
00:27:10 gravitational pull of jupiter is probably creating all kinds of movement under that ice
00:27:19 how did life evolve on earth yes sure life now most of life that we above the surface look at has to do with
00:27:29 exploiting the solar energy for you know our daily behavior but that's not the case everywhere on the planet
00:27:37 if you look at the bottom of the ocean there are hydrothermal vents there's both black smokers and white
00:27:42 smokers and they are near these volcanic  you know ducts that basically emanate
00:27:51 a massive amount of energy from the core of our planet what does life need it needs energy does
00:27:56 it need energy from the sun it couldn't care less does it need energy from
00:28:03 you know the earth itself yeah possibly it could use that and if you look at how did life evolve
00:28:09 on you know on earth there are many theories i mean a kind of silly theory is that it came from outer space
00:28:15 that basically there's a meteorite out there that sort of landed on earth and it brought with it
00:28:20 dna material i think it's a little silly because it kind of pushes the buck down the road
00:28:23 basically the next question is how did it evolve over there yeah whereas our planet has basically all of
00:28:28 the right ingredients why wouldn't evolve here so basically let's kind of ignore that one and now
00:28:32 that the two other competing hypotheses are from the outside in or from the inside out
00:28:38 from the outside in means from the surface to the bottom of the ocean ah from the inside out means from the
00:28:51 so life on the surface is pretty brutal life obviously evolved in the water and then there was an out of water event
00:29:01 but basically before it exited it was clearly in the water which is a much nicer and shielded environment
00:29:08 so just to be clear on the surface are you referring to the the surface of the sea or the bottom of the sea
00:29:15 versus the bottom of the sea and you're saying life on the surface is  it's harsh like inside the life outside the water
00:29:24 is horrible it takes huge amounts of evolutionary innovations to sustain
00:29:31 living outside the water well that's so interesting why why is that so it's easier to life is easier
00:29:37 in the water maybe see i'm telling you don't water yeah dolphins went back into the water really
00:29:44 because dolphins are mammals of course yeah interesting well again they might be smarter they
00:29:49 went back so so if you if you basically think about the fact that we are 70 water we're
00:29:59 basically transporting the sea with us outside the sea you know if we if we don't have
00:30:05 water for about a year 24 hours we're dry yeah and if you look at life under the sea i mean i don't know if you're a diver
00:30:13 but when you go diving your brain explodes again when i say the light the boring life forms is what we see all the time
00:30:21 like tetrapods i mean what a stupid boring body plan seriously like just go diving and you'll see that a tiny little minority
00:30:29 of the stuff under the sea under the surface of the sea is actually tetrapods it's like you know snails with all kinds
00:30:37 of crazy appendages and colors and you know round things and five-way symmetric things and you know
00:30:43 eight-way symmetric things all kinds of crazy body plans and only the tetrapod fish managed to
00:30:48 get out and then they gave rise to all the boring plants we kind of see today
00:30:55 of basically you know  humans with four limbs birds with four limbs lizards with four
00:31:00 limbs and you know right it's kind of boring if you look at by comparison
00:31:05 life underwater is teeming with diversity so now let's roll back the clock and basically say
00:31:12 where did life in the ocean come from from the surface or from the bottom exactly those two
00:31:18 options exactly so basically life on the surface is one option and then the idea there is that there's tides with the moon and the sun
00:31:26 sort of causing all this movement and this movement is basically causing nutrients to sort of
00:31:32 you know coalesce and you know bounce around et cetera that's one option the second option massive amount of
00:31:37 energy under you know from from from our the core of our planet
00:31:44 basically  exploited leading to these basic ingredients of life forms
00:31:49 and what are these basic ingredients metabolism being able to take energy from the environment and put it as part of yourself
00:31:57 metabolism it basically means it basically means taking stuff from you know like nutrients or energy source or
00:32:09 anything and then making it your own the second one is compartmentalization if there's no notion of
00:32:16 self there can't be evolution you have to know where your own boundaries end and where the non-self boundaries begin
00:32:22 and that's basically the lipid bilayer nowadays which is extremely simple to to form
00:32:28 it's basically just a bunch of lipids and then they eventually just self-organize into a membrane
00:32:34 so that's a very natural way of forming a self and then the third component is replication
00:32:41 replication doesn't need to be self-replication it could be a helps make more of b b helps make more
00:32:47 of c and c helps make more of a any kind of self-reinforcement is what you need to ignite the process
00:32:55 of evolution after you've ignited that process you know i don't want to say all hell breaks
00:33:02 loose but all paradise breaks loose so basically you then boom you know have life going
00:33:09 and the moment you have abc some kind of thing looping back onto a you can make modifications and you can improve and then you let
00:33:16 natural selection work is there some element of that that's like co like 
00:33:23 like some state representation that stores information like maybe i should say information
00:33:28 absolutely is that talking about the part we like to think of life as the information propagation which is dna
00:33:38 the messenger which is rna and then the action which is protein so basically dna we think is an essential part of life
00:33:48 that's where the storage is and therefore that early life forms must have had some kind of storage
00:33:54 medium dna if you look at how life actually evolved dna was invented much later proteins were invented later
00:34:06 and rna was find by itself thank you very much in an rna world so the early
00:34:13 version of life as we know it today was in fact rna molecules performing all of the functions
00:34:21 the rna molecule itself was the protein actuator by creating three-dimensional folds
00:34:28 through self-hybridization itself what self-hybridization so basically the same way that dna molecules
00:34:33 can hybridize with themselves and basically form this double helix the single-stranded rna molecule can form
00:34:41 partial double helixes in various places creating structure as if you had a long string with
00:34:47 complementary parts and you could then sort of design kind of like origami-like structures
00:34:52 that will fall down to themselves and then you can make any shape from that that early rna world eventually got
00:35:02 to replication where enzymes encoded in rna would replicate rna itself and then
00:35:11 that process basically kicked off evolution and that process of evolution then led to major innovations
00:35:20 the first innovation was translation so you start with an rna molecule and you translate it into another kind of
00:35:26 form and that's the first kind of encoding you're like well do you need some kind of code yeah but
00:35:31 the code was in fact one thing it was conflated with the actuators the actuators were
00:35:40 separated from the code only later on so you first had the self-replicating code which was also the actuator
00:35:46 and then you kind of have a functionalization partitioning of the functionalization a sub-functionalization of the proteins that are now going to be
00:35:54 the workhorse of life but they're not self-replicating the code remains the rna
00:36:01 so the most beautiful and most complex rna machine known to man is the ribosome the ribosome
00:36:09 is this massive factory that is able to translate rna into protein the ribosome if you if you want i don't know divine
00:36:17 intervention in the history of life the ribosome is it that's one of the great invention in the history of life
00:36:23 it's it's yeah but again you can't think of great inventions as one one-time steps they're basically you
00:36:28 know the culmination of probably many competing software infrastructures for life preservation
00:36:37 that won out and then when the ribosome was so efficient at making proteins all the other ones basically died out
00:36:43 and then the life forms that were using the modern ribosome
00:36:48 were basically the more successful ones because it could make proteins and now those proteins are much more versatile
00:36:57 because rna only has four bases proteins eventually have 20 amino acids not initially but eventually
00:37:04 and then they can form in much more complex shapes and they can create all kinds of additional machines
00:37:11 one of which is reverse transcriptase so you basically now have rna again we like to think of transcription as the
00:37:18 normal reverse transcription as the oddball well rna preceded dna so reverse transcription actually was the first
00:37:26 invention before transcription itself so basically rna invents proteins rna and proteins together invent dna so you now have a more stable medium
00:37:38 a more stable backbone with two helices instead of one two strands instead of one the double
00:37:46 helix and rna basically says listen i'm tired i'm gonna delegate all information stories to dna
00:37:55 and i'm going to delegate most actuation to proteins proteins but that's to you is not like a
00:38:02 that's just an efficiency thing it's not a fundamental new correlation that's why when you're
00:38:08 asking is a separate information storage medium a definition of life like no any kind of self preservation self reinforcement and it
00:38:16 didn't need to be rna rna-based initially it didn't need to be self-replication
00:38:22 initially you just need to have enough rna molecules randomly arising that reinforce each other
00:38:29 that ultimately lead to the you know the closing of that loop and the ignition of the evolutionary process
00:38:37 can we just rewind a little bit like if you were to bet all your money on the two options
00:38:42 in terms of where life started probably the bottom at the bottom though i don't know if
00:38:47 this is answerable but how hard is the first step or if there's something interesting you
00:38:53 can say about that first leap yeah yeah yeah about from not from not life to life
00:39:00 yeah i think it's inevitable on earth or just in the universe i think it's inevitable
00:39:07 if you look at europa you know going back to the the moon of jupiter it's also a
00:39:14 really nice song by santana basically has all the ingredients it has you know the core that can emit energy
00:39:24 it has the shielding through the ice sheet protecting it just like an atmosphere would it even has a layer of oxygen
00:39:32 probably sufficiently dense to sustain life so my guess is that there's probably
00:39:41  independently a reason life form already teeming in europa because as soon as it
00:39:48 today is that exciting or terrifying to you it's i mean as a scientist i can't wait to see
00:39:58 non-dna based life forms i can't wait because we are so born  in in you know sort of  borne
00:40:08 as i would say in french but basically we're sort of you know we we we are so narrow-minded in our thinking
00:40:16 of what life should look like that i can't wait for all that to just be blown away by the discovery of life elsewhere let
00:40:22 me bring you into another science fiction  it's a scenario so on that point if we discover life on europa
00:40:33 and you were brought in you seem very excited but how would you start looking at that life
00:40:42 in a way that's useful to you as a scientist but also not going to kill all of us so like to me it's a little bit scary
00:40:53 because not not because it's a malevolent life like it's a it's a dictator petting like a cat it's evil
00:41:01 but just the way life is it seems to be very good at conquering other life so there's a
00:41:06 lot of science fiction movies based on that principle yeah and that's sort of what causes the
00:41:11 public to be so scared but if you think about sort of would europa life be scared of humans
00:41:17 coming over and taking over chances are no not even like earth bacteria because earth bacteria would be
00:41:22 wiped out in an instant in this foreign world because they don't know how to metabolize
00:41:30 energy that doesn't come from the types of energy sources that are here the levels of acidity may just kill us
00:41:35 all off and at the same way in this in in the converse way
00:41:40 if you bring life from europa on earth it'll die instantly because it's too hot or because it doesn't need to know how
00:41:46 to cope with i don't know the sun's radiation so close to this completely inhabitable zone
00:41:54 by their standards so so what we call the habitable zone might actually be the inhabitants for
00:41:59 them so the difference if the environments are sufficiently different you think we'll just
00:42:05 not be able to even attack each other and a basic  it'll take massive amounts of
00:42:09 engineering to create machines that will go there and sample the you know oceans basically drill through
00:42:20 the layers of ice to basically sample and see what life is like there and detecting it
00:42:27 will probably be trivial it definitely won't be dna based it's not like we're going to send a sequencer
00:42:33 but it'll be you know some other kind of combination of chemicals that will look non-random so if you had to bet if i took that life
00:42:40 form we find on europa and like put it on a sandwich that you're eating and like eat that sandwich
00:42:48 it'll taste just fine and you'll be well don't know about that i don't know anyone well it tastes fine that's
00:42:53 interesting so the other question is do we have taste adaptations to chemical molecules that
00:43:03 we are used to seeing so you think we don't have case bugs for things we don't even know about wow so
00:43:07 we won't yeah we want to be able to know that this chemical tastes funny but you think it won't be it's likely
00:43:13 not to be dangerous like it won't know how to even interrupt do you think our immune system will
00:43:20 will even detect that something weird is probably and it'll be very easy to detect because it'll be very different from very weird
00:43:27 but it won't be able to sort of attack i mean the scene from i don't know independence day
00:43:31 where like they're communicating with the other computer and they're like ooh i'm in
00:43:36 i mean it's hilarious because like macs i mean let alone an alien technology or even alien dna
00:43:45 so okay  now i was talking about you being a scientist on earth but say you were a scientist  they were
00:43:51 shipped over to europa to investigate if there's life what would you look for
00:43:57 in terms of signs of life life is unmistakable i would say the way that life transforms a planet
00:44:04 surrounding it is not the kind of thing that you would expect from the physical
00:44:11 laws alone so it's i would say that as soon as life arises it creates this compartmentalization
00:44:20 it starts pushing things away it starts sort of keeping things inside that herself and there's a whole signature
00:44:29 that you can see from that so when i was organizing my meaning of life symposium my my my friend was an astrophysicist um
00:44:36 basically  we were deciding on what would be the themes for the for the symposium and then  i
00:44:41 said well we're going to have biology we're going to have physics and she's like come on biology is just a small part of physics
00:44:50 everything is a small part of physics and  i mean in in many ways it is but my immediate
00:44:56 answer was no no wait life challenges physics it supersedes physics it sort of fights against physics
00:45:04 and that's what i would look for in europa i would basically look for this fight against physics for anything that
00:45:09 sort of signatures of not just entropy at work not just things diffusing away
00:45:17 not just gravitational pulls but clear signatures of you remember when i was talking earlier about this whole
00:45:23 selection for environment selection for biospheres for ecosystems for this multi-organism form
00:45:30 of life and i think that's sort of the the first thing that you can look for you know chemical signatures that are
00:45:36 not simply predicted from the reactions you would get randomly such a beautiful
00:45:41 way to look at life so you're basically leveraging some energy source to enable you to resist the physics of
00:45:48 the universe fighting against physics but that's that's the first transformation if you
00:45:52 look at humans we're way past that what do you mean by transformation so so
00:45:58 basically there's there's layers i sort of see life you know when we talk about the
00:46:04 meaning of life life can be construed at many levels we talked about
00:46:10 life in the simplest form of sort of the ignition of evolution and that's sort of the basic definition that you can check off yes
00:46:17 it's alive but when alexander the great was asked to whom do you owe your life to your teachers
00:46:28 or to your parents and alexander the great  answered i owe to my parents the zine the life itself and i owe to my
00:46:37 teachers the f zine like euphony f means good the opposite of cacophony which means
00:46:44 you know bad so f zine in his  words was basically living
00:46:54 a human life a proper life so basically we can go from the zine to the f-zine and that transformation has taken
00:47:03 several additional leaps so basically you know life on europa i'm pretty sure has gotten to the stage of
00:47:11 a makes b makes c makes a again but getting to the f zine is a whole other level and that level requires
00:47:22 cooperation that level requires altruism that level requires specialization remember how we're talking about the rna
00:47:31 specializing into dna for storage proteins and then compartmentalizations and if you look at prokaryotic life
00:47:38 there's no nucleus it's all one soup of things intermingling if you look at
00:47:46 eukaryotic life again you for true good you know so a eukaryote basically has a nucleus and that's where
00:47:53 you compartmentalize further the organization of the information storage from all of the daily activities if you
00:48:01 look at a you know human body plan or any animal you have a comparablization of the
00:48:05 germline you basically have one lineage that will basically be saved for the future generations
00:48:11 and everything outside that lineage is almost superfluous if you think about it the rest of your
00:48:17 body all it does is ensure that that lineage will make it to the next generation
00:48:23 that these germ lines will make to the next generation the rest is packaging i'm sorry to be so blunt yeah and if you
00:48:29 look at nutrition you know where deterostomes what does the stone mean
00:48:35 dertero means second where this is the second mouth the first mouth is actually down here is the esophagus
00:48:42 so dirt or stones have evolved a second layer of eating kind of like alien with the two mouths
00:48:47 yeah so you can think of us as alien where the first mouth is up here and then the second mouth is down there
00:48:53 is of course is the first mouth just the the the physical manipulation of the food to make it more correct
00:48:59 correct and basically again you know if you look at if you look at a worm it's an extremely simple life form it
00:49:05 basically has a mouth it has an anus and it has you know just some organs in between that consume the food and just
00:49:10 spit spit out poo humans are basically a fancy form of that so you basically have the mouth you have
00:49:17 the digestive tract and then you have limbs to get better at getting food you have
00:49:23 eyesight hearing etc to get better getting food yeah and then you have of course the
00:49:28 germline and all of this food part it's just auxiliary to their germline so you basically have layers of
00:49:34 addition of comparablization of specialization on top of this zine to get all the way to the earth scene
00:49:42 yeah so like the warm is like windows 95 very few features very basic and then us humans are like
00:49:48 windows vista or windows 10 whatever it is well a few innovations beyond that but yeah and then all right
00:49:55 where i don't know where windows 3000 at least is such a fascinating way to look at life as a set of transformations
00:50:03 exactly so like is there some interesting transformations to our history here on earth that like appeal
00:50:09 to you of course so and what are the most brilliant innovations and transformations yeah
00:50:14 yeah yeah i mean this is such a fascinating question of course like you know we're talking about basic
00:50:18 basic life forms and we'll talk about eukaryotic life forms and then the next big transformation is
00:50:24 multicellular life forms where the specialization separates the germ line
00:50:30 from everything else that accompanies it and sort of carries it and then that specialization then sort
00:50:35 of has this massive new innovation like above the second mouth
00:50:41 which is this massive brain and this massive brain is basically something that arises
00:50:47 much much later on basically you know notochords like having the first spinal cord this whole concept that along with the
00:50:53 this very simple layers you basically now have a coordinating agent
00:50:59 and this coordinating agent is starting to make decisions and remember when we're talking about 
00:51:04 free will i mean you know as a worm is hunting for food oh it has plenty of free will it can
00:51:10 choose to you know follow chemotaxis to the left for chemotaxis to the right and maybe that's
00:51:16 free will because it's unpredictable beyond a certain level so you basically now have
00:51:24 more and more decision making and coordination of all of these different body parts and organs
00:51:30 by a central operating system a central machine that basically will control the rest of the body and the other thing
00:51:35 that i love talking about is the different time scales at which things happen
00:51:40 you know we're talking about the human epi genome before the human epigenome is basically able to find
00:51:47 what genes should be expressed in response to environmental stimuli in the order of minutes and basically
00:51:54 receive a stimulus transfer all that data through this humongously long string
00:52:01 of searching and then sort of find what genes to turn on and then create all that all of that is
00:52:06 happening in the time scale of minutes basically you know three minutes to a to half an hour
00:52:12 that's the expression response but our daily life doesn't happen on the order of three minutes to
00:52:16 half an hour it happens on the order of milliseconds like i throw a ball at you you catch it right away
00:52:21 no gene expression changes there you just don't have time to do that so you basically have a layer of control
00:52:30 built on a hardware that supports it but that hardware itself lives in a different time scale
00:52:36 than the controlling machine on top of that is that an accident by the way is that like a feature is it
00:52:42 was it possible for life to have evolved where the our the daily life of the organism as it interacts with its environment
00:52:51 was on time scale similar to  the the way our internals work if you look at
00:52:57 trees they look kind of boring and stupid you're like looking at a tree like stupid if you speed up the movie of
00:53:01 a tree from spring until october you'll be like oh my god it's intelligent
00:53:09 and the reason for that is that at that time scale the tree is basically saying oh i'm
00:53:13 looking for a you know a thing to catch on to oh i just caught on to that i'm going to grow more here i'm
00:53:18 going to spawn there etc like i can see the trees in my garden just growing and sort of you know
00:53:23 looping around and it's all a matter of time scale and if you look at the human time scale
00:53:30 remember we were talking about neoteny the last time around the whole fact that our young are pretty useless
00:53:38 until you know maybe you know a few months of age if not a few years of age if not i don't know getting out of college
00:53:45 and then we we basically hold them enabling their brain to continue being malleable and infusing it with knowledge and you
00:53:53 know thoughts as you know that period of neotimi increases and expands
00:54:00 if you fast forward i don't know another million years so humans have only been around you know
00:54:07 different from apes for about that long jump another unit of that another human gym divergence
00:54:16 what could happen from an evolutionary time scale a lot one of the things that's happening already
00:54:23 is expansion of human lifespan we have longer and longer periods before we mature and we have longer and longer periods
00:54:29 because before we have babies so intergenerational distance is you know grown from i don't know 16 years to
00:54:37 40 years you're saying that's in the genetics like no no not necessarily but but it's it's
00:54:43 sort of an environmental tendency that's happening but as we medically expand human lifespan the
00:54:54 generations might actually be pushed instead of 40 years to 60 years to 100 years if we look at
00:54:58 the long arc of the evolutionary history exactly so as we start thinking about intergalactic
00:55:06 travel now i'm sorry that's that's a heck of a transition  yeah so let's talk about it no no no
00:55:13 no no as as we as a species start thinking about i mean i'm talking about these transitions that
00:55:18 are happening right now and that's that's so awesome continuing along these
00:55:22 transitions what does the future hold in the next million years so the concept of us going to another planet
00:55:29 and that taking three human lifetimes might be a joke if the human lifetime starts being 400
00:55:34 years or 800 years so imagine this time scale it's all time scale just
00:55:40 different time skills yeah you asked me offline whether i would like to live forever i mean
00:55:47 my answer is absolutely and there's many different types of forevers one forever
00:55:54 is do i want to live today forever kind of like groundhog day and the answer is
00:55:59 absolutely the stuff that i want to learn today will probably take a lifetime just to learn you know basically to
00:56:05 clear my to-do list for the day you mean like relive the day of the day and then and then pick up different
00:56:10 things from the richness of the experiences there's just so much happening in the world every single day so much knowledge
00:56:17 that has happened already that just to catch up on that will probably take me around forever
00:56:22 and that on that point i just i would just love to see you in the groundhog movie just because you're so
00:56:30 naturally as a scientist but just the way your mind works beautifully just all the richness of the experiences
00:56:36 that you would pick up from that  that's a beautiful visual but you just try to live each day as if it was groundhog
00:56:42 i'm basically every single day waking up and saying all right how would bill murray get out of that one well you know what
00:56:47 on  on a funny tangent like i got a chance to 
00:56:55 go to a neural link demonstration event i'm not usually familiar with neurolink and  i talked to elon for a while 
00:57:04 and one of the funny things he said on this groundhog day thing is you know it's a beautiful
00:57:09 dream to eventually be able to replay our memories so we're
00:57:14 kind of these recording machines our brain is kind of  maybe a noisy recording machine of memories
00:57:22 and it would be beautiful if we can someday in the future maybe far into the future be able to like in the groundhog day
00:57:29 situation replay that and the funny comment that stuck with me is he said that
00:57:36 maybe this our conversation now is a replay of a member of a previous memory and that stuck with me because
00:57:44 it would probably be my replay you know who the hell am i i'm just some idiot guy but like elon musk is you know
00:57:52 probably because of spacex and so on is probably going to be remembered as a special person
00:57:57 one of our special apes in history so if i wanted to replay memory probably be that one you know talking to elon for
00:58:03 a while yeah that's an interesting  possibility from 
00:58:10 if we think about time scales if we think about the richness of the experience through time
00:58:18 that we humans take and be able to replace some aspects of that of that biology that's
00:58:24 super interesting but anyway sorry sorry for the tangent let's yeah you were talking about time scales
00:58:30 and the expansion of the human lifetime and  the intergalactic travel yeah no but but
00:58:37 you're laughing about this yeah for sure that is you're talking about this you're talking about
00:58:42 exploring alien worlds yeah and going to other planets i mean you know when sarah was here she was
00:58:46 talking about sort of going to other planets when we find these life i mean i'm just very naturally
00:58:53 given the topics that we've approached talking about the the time scale at which this will happen
00:58:59 so i think eventually we will human or life life will expand out into the universe the the point that i'm trying to make is
00:59:07 that in intergalactic species we'll probably find ways to engineer its biology in order to expand the way that we experience
00:59:18 time expand the the time skills that we experienced and going back to this whole concept of you know would i like to live forever
00:59:25 yes i'd like to live forever even if it was even if i was stuck on the same day i'd love to live forever because i would
00:59:30 finally have time to do all these things that i want to do but if living forever actually comes
00:59:35 with a perk of watching the whole world evolve forever i mean
00:59:41 that's a huge perk and i would you know just it'll never get boring just an ever-changing world and then the
00:59:47 mind  you know sort of experiment that i want you to to do
00:59:53 is to also ask what if i wanted to live forever one day at a time every year or one day at a time every decade would
01:00:01 you choose that where you would wake up and the world would be 10 years later
01:00:06 every single day you wake up it's the opposite of groundhog day where basically you always wake up and
01:00:11 it's always 10 years later so you're saying that's such a powerful interesting concept that life is
01:00:21 more interesting if you're of all the life forms on earth that you're the slowest one exactly
01:00:28 exactly like trees like you know they've been there since the minoan civilization yeah and you
01:00:33 know that takes us back to the the question you asked about sort of the transformations that have happened
01:00:38 in humanity the minoan civilization is one of them you know there's this paper that was
01:00:42 published just a couple of years ago by one of my friends that basically looked at the
01:00:51  genetic makeup of the minoans and the messinians in ancient greek in ancient greece and how they relate to
01:00:56 modern greeks and they found that indeed there was very little gene flow
01:01:03 from you know the outside and you know it's it's fantastic to sort of think about these amazing civilizations
01:01:11 that transformed the way that human thought happens that basically looked for rules in nature that looked for principles
01:01:19 that looked for the standards of beauty not human beauty but beauty in the natural world
01:01:27 this whole concept that the world must be elegant and there must be deeper ways of
01:01:31 understanding that world to me that's a massive transformation of our species
01:01:38 similar to you know the earlier transformation we were talking about of even involving a brain
01:01:45 of you know learning how to communicate language or the evolution of eyesight if you look at sort of
01:01:51 you know we're talking about these worms crawling around and then sensing which direction are the chemicals more abundant
01:01:59 you know chemotaxis so eventually they grow a nose eventually they grow  i mean when i say nose i mean
01:02:04 ways of sensing chemicals that's probably one of the earliest senses you know we always talk about how deep
01:02:09 rooted is in your brain that's one of the earliest senses if you look at hearing that's a much
01:02:14 later sense if you look at eyesight that's an intermediate sense where you're basically sensing where the light
01:02:18 direction comes from that's probably something that life didn't mean until it got you know into
01:02:22 the surface and so on and so forth so there's a lot of you know milestones and i was talking
01:02:31 about the latest milestone which is ligo last time of being able to detect gravitational waves
01:02:37 and sort of being able to sort of have a sense that humans haven't had before so you see that as a yet another transformation
01:02:43 it gives us an extra little sound of course and now if you go back to this history of ancient greece
01:02:48 i mean this this transformation that happened i mean of course the egyptians had this incredible you
01:02:55 know civilization for thousands of years but what happened in greece was this whole concept of let's break things down
01:03:01 and understand the natural world let's break things down and understand physics let's basically build rules
01:03:06 around architecture about around elegance around you know statues and tragedy i mean another question that
01:03:14 you asked me in passing was this whole concept of embracing the good and the bad
01:03:20 embracing your the full range of human emotions and if you look at greek tragedy it's the definition of that
01:03:29 it's i mean drama i mean again it's a greek word but but the whole concept of some
01:03:37 problems that are just so vast and large that dying is the easy way out the death oh that's the easy solution
01:03:45 you know so so i want to touch a little bit on that point and and um
01:03:52 sort of talk about this concept that life supersedes physics and that the brain supersedes life
01:04:03 that basically we have a brain that can decide to not follow evolution's path we can decide to not have children
01:04:12 we can decide to not eat we can decide to suicide we can decide to sort of abolish
01:04:18 communication with the outside world i mean all the things that make us human we can basically decide
01:04:25 not to do that and that that is basically when the brain itself is basically superseding
01:04:35 what evolution program is for so okay so one of the it's okay my mind was already blown
01:04:42 at the beautiful formulation of the idea that life is  is a system that resists physics yeah and
01:04:53 our brain or perhaps the content of it or however maybe functionally our brain is a thing that resists life yes
01:05:05 yes you're so you're so brilliant but but but but i want you to see all of that as
01:05:11 a continuum basically you're sort of talking about the sort of individual transformations
01:05:17 but it's a path yeah that that humanity has a transformation it's a path of transformation and then i
01:05:21 want us to think about what it truly means to become human like the
01:05:28 f zine and you asked me about what motivated my meaning of life symposium what motivated it in part i mean of
01:05:35 course it was an inside joke of turning 42 but what motivated him in part was actually a mid-life crisis
01:05:44 so the joke that i always like to say is chris papadimitriou a famous greek professor who was previously at mit at harvard at
01:05:50 stanford berkeley everywhere  brilliant brilliant person that's actually costis advisor
01:05:56 yeah  so so christopher means really likes to say that when you're an undergrad you work like a
01:06:01 rat to get into grad school and where you grasp you work like a rat to get your phd
01:06:06 and where you're post doc you work like a rat to get your assistant professors in jail
01:06:10 and where is this profession you work like a rat to become a full professor and then when you're a full professor
01:06:19 well by then you're basically a rat that's brilliant so basically what happened to me is that
01:06:24 i arrived at the end of the rat race yeah you know life is a rat race you constantly have
01:06:29 hurdles to jump over you constantly have tunnels and secret pathways and i figured it all out and eventually
01:06:35 as i was turning 42 i looked back and i was like wow that was an awesome rat race
01:06:43 but i'm not a rat i basically got out of the labyrinth and i was like i'm not i'm not a rat turns out is that
01:06:50 the first moment where you saw that it's that you were in a rat race it no no i've known that i'm in a rat race
01:06:56 for a long time it's so easy to be in a rat race it's so easy to be an undergraduate because you have problem
01:07:00 sets and you know we're all smart people you know problem set it has a solution somebody
01:07:06 made it for you you can just solve it everything was made as a test and you keep passing those tests and tests and
01:07:11 tests and tests and you have tasks that are well defined the phd is a little different
01:07:18 because it's more open-ended but yet you have an advisor who's guiding you and then you become a professor and tenure
01:07:26 is a well-set defined set of tasks and you do all that and at 42 i basically had bought a house
01:07:34 three kids beautiful wife tenure yeah awesome students tons of grants life was basically laid out for me and
01:07:42 that's when i had my main life crisis that's when people usually buy a harley davidson
01:07:49 and they basically say oh i need something new i need something different and to be young myself etc
01:07:53 but basically that was my realization that it's not a rat race that there's no rat race it's over that
01:08:02 i have to basically think how do i fully instantiate myself how do i complete my transformation into an
01:08:08 actual human being because it's very easy to sort of forget all the intangibles of life
01:08:14 it's very hard to just sort of think about the next task and the next ask and it's all metrics and you know what's the
01:08:18 number of viewers i have what is the number of you know publications i have what's the number of citations
01:08:23 the number of talks the number of grants it's very easy to quantify everything and then at some point you're like this
01:08:28 is real life it's not a test anymore and that's something that i told my wife
01:08:35 early on i was like no no our life is not going to be let's put the kids through college
01:08:39 and that you know maybe that's when i escaped the rat race maybe it continued being a rat race maybe the next step
01:08:43 would have been all right how do i make sure that my kid is first in class how do i make sure
01:08:48 that they're you know into the great greatest callers and then you know they're into college
01:08:57 so how do you how do you escape but what is   is is there a light at the end of the
01:09:03 tunnel of a midlife crisis so so you should watch that symposium because the videos were transformative
01:09:10 to me and to many others so basically the advice that i received from all of my
01:09:17 friends was so meaningful this you know there's some some advice that basically says
01:09:25 you have to constantly maintain unachievable goals goals that you can make progress towards
01:09:32 but you can never be fully done with and i think that's almost playing into the sort of rat race thing like
01:09:36 basically make sure that there's more obstacles for your little rant persona to jump through
01:09:43 so that's one possibility so first of all watch is it available it's on youtube just google it
01:09:49 google really meaning of licensing i've known this and you should have told me this like this is awesome
01:09:55 okay yeah this is great but and also like you know saying rat race is  you know if you look at ratatouille it's not
01:10:05 i mean that's a beautiful that's a beautiful thing of challenges and overcoming child that
01:10:10 could be fundamentally the meaning of life is  to see
01:10:20 life as a set of challenges and to fully engage in the overcoming of those challenges i would say that that's embracing the
01:10:26 rat race view of life so so a joke that we like to have with my wife all the time is
01:10:33 we basically say we we pretend that we're in this all-inclusive resort that we've basically hired all these
01:10:39 people to go on the esplanade and play games because we enjoy watching people playing on the esplanade and
01:10:44 we enjoy sort of laying and looking at life and all the people biking and rollerblading and all that
01:10:49 and then we've paid all these people in this all-inclusive resort that we live in and then  what are we going to do
01:10:55 today i'm like oh i've signed up for professor activities it's going to be awesome they they lined
01:10:59 up a bunch of super smart mit students for me to meet with i'm gonna have a grant writing meeting afterwards it's
01:11:03 gonna be awesome and then she signed up for a bunch of consulting activities it's
01:11:07 gonna be great and then in the evening we just get back together and say hey how was your
01:11:14 consulting today so in a way that's another view of life of basically wait a minute if i was a gazillionaire
01:11:20 what would i choose to do i would probably pay an awesome university to give me an office there
01:11:25 and just pay a bunch of super smart people to work with me even though they don't
01:11:30 really want to etc etc in fact i would have exactly the life that i have now
01:11:38 working my butt off every single day because it's so freaking fulfilling well that's so let's clarify this is a
01:11:45 beautiful way it's almost like a video game view of life that it's a set of i mean again game is not
01:11:52 perhaps a positive term but it's a it's a it is a beautiful time so you you do do you or do you not like the
01:12:01 rat race view of life no because it is fulfilling in some the right race is about the goal
01:12:08 my view of life is about the path so again quote in greece those folks have come up with some good stuff so this um
01:12:19 basically wrote this  beautiful poem about sort of going through life saying as you go through your journey
01:12:29 impersonating ulysses of his voyage he says wish that the path is long and arduous because when you get
01:12:40 to ithaca you might realize that it was all about the path not the destination and so the rat rate view of life makes
01:12:50 it all about the destination it's like how do i get through the maze to get there but the all-inclusive resort view of life
01:13:00 is about the path it's about wow today i couldn't wish for a better set of activities
01:13:07 all programmed for me to enjoy having my brain having my body having my senses and you know the life that i have so
01:13:15 it's a very different kind of view it's focused on the journey not on the destination so we
01:13:21 you mentioned kind of the ups and downs of life and the midlife crisis and right now you said
01:13:29 focusing kind of on the journey but what the journey involves is ups and downs is there
01:13:39  advice or any kind of thoughts that you can elucidate about the downs in your life yeah the hard parts of your
01:13:47 life and how you got out or maybe not or is there yeah how do you see the dark parts of life
01:13:56 so i i'm so glad you're asking this question because it's something that our society does a terrible
01:14:03 job at preparing us for every hollywood movie has to have a happy ending it is ridiculous you can count on your ten fingers
01:14:11 the number of bad ending movies that you've ever watched and you probably wouldn't need all 10 fingers
01:14:19 we strive to tell everyone yes you can succeed yes you're a millionaire just temporarily disabled
01:14:29 and yes you know  the prince will eventually figure out his princess and they will have
01:14:36 a happily ever after ending and yes the hero will be beaten and beaten and beaten but you know that at the end
01:14:42 of the movie the googly eyes will win we need more movies where the bad guys win we need more movies where just
01:14:47 everybody dies we're just you know a macgyver doesn't figure out how to disable the bomb and
01:14:53 it just explodes you just you just need more movies that are more realistic about the fact that
01:14:58 life kind of sucks sometimes and it's okay so again growing up in greece i i have been exposed to songs
01:15:09 that are not just sad but they're miserable miserable so so one of them one of them comes to mind
01:15:19 and and it's it's basically talking about this woman who's lamenting in the early morning
01:15:27 about losing the joyful kid the joyful young man who basically died in the civil war in the arms
01:15:38 of our own fellow citizens and she's like if only he had died fighting the foreign forces if only he
01:15:45 had died at the you know sides of the you know general if only he had died with honor
01:15:55 i would be proud to have lost the joyful kid i mean it's devastating right it's like he didn't just
01:16:03 die he died without honor yeah and and i my friend who was with me was listening to the song and she's like
01:16:09 this is depressing i'm like you have to listen to another one it's not as sad and she's like what this one
01:16:15 died with honor so so that's one example it's a kind of a celebration
01:16:22 of  misery no no no no no no so let me give you a couple more examples and and then i'll answer that question
01:16:28 so another example is i i picked up this book that i had from my childhood and i started reading stories to my kids
01:16:33 and the first story is about these two children one is really poor living on the street
01:16:38 and the other one is really rich living in the house and the bright light above and the poor one is wishing looking at
01:16:44 that window and wishing that you could have that house and the other one is at the window
01:16:48 wishing that he was free that he wasn't sick all the time that you could escape outside it's only four pages long and at the end
01:16:55 both children die one of them dies from cold the other one dies from illness
01:17:01 and you're like how is that even a children's story the next story i'm like okay that's fine
01:17:06 let's skip this one let's you know so i read this to my kids and then i read the next one and the next one is
01:17:10 about this this woman whose brother is at war against the turks and he is
01:17:21 gonna die and she prays to the virgin please don't let him die and the virgin appears and she's like
01:17:29 no problem tell me who to kill instead and she's like anyone anyone no no no choose one
01:17:35 how about this turk this one has two kids a beautiful family waiting for him at home she's like no not this one choose
01:17:41 another one and then she goes through all the life stories of the other and since he's like
01:17:44 no no just don't take anyone he's like i can't do that
01:17:49 i can you can choose to bring your brother back and he will be depressed for the rest of his life because he
01:17:54 didn't fight at war because he didn't go to that battle and he will live without her she's like
01:18:01 and in the end the woman decides to have her brother killed instead because he dies with her i mean this is insane
01:18:07 so so why am i giving you these examples it's not a glorification of misery it's a it's expand your emotional range
01:18:17 it's teaching you that and and when i read these stories i'm not i'm not a jerk i'm crying out loud
01:18:24 i have tears and i like my face becomes red from the the the pain that i'm experiencing through these stories
01:18:34 it's just so deeply touching to embrace the suffering not because of an
01:18:44 accident but because of a choice the sacrifice to embrace the fact that not everything is cute and rosy and
01:18:51 always ending well and i think that we don't do a good enough job of teaching our kids that
01:18:56 just life sucks and life is unfair sometimes and that's and that's okay
01:19:02 and sometimes i read a story to my kids i read a story every night and sometimes the story is horrible
01:19:09 and sometimes the story is good and and sort of friendly and happy and my kids always ask what's the moral
01:19:14 of the story and sometimes those are moral and it's like oh you should be good or you should be
01:19:19 nice you should be helping each other et cetera and sometimes it's just no moral and i tell my kids you know what
01:19:26 sometimes just life doesn't make sense and it's okay and you can't comprehend everything and
01:19:31 i think this concept of how do you deal with bad days comes from the fact that we're taught
01:19:37 we're brainwashed into thinking that every day should be a happy day and we're not ready to cope with misery
01:19:46 and the other thing that crying through these stories teaches you is that you don't have it
01:19:55 do you see do you see what i mean basically it tells you that i mean my mom would always tell me about how
01:20:02 she was transformed as a teenager when she volunteered in the hospital and she saw all these people
01:20:10 at the brink of death clinging for life and helping them out to be as she could and crying her her heart out when they were dying
01:20:19 and sort of how that taught her the appreciation for what we have every day waking up every morning and saying
01:20:30 my life doesn't suck my life is not nearly half as bad as it could be and and sort of embracing the
01:20:40 joy that we have of living where we live in the moment we live and i'm gonna go further if you look at the arc of human
01:20:50 life the you know human existence through the centuries there's no better way to be alive than now
01:20:56 i mean we're complaining about every single little thing but life expectancy is at an all-time high
01:21:04 sickness all-time low poorness misery all-time low there's no better time to be alive
01:21:11 globally across all of human existence number one number two here in boston there's no
01:21:17 better place to be alive if you think about the amalgamation of science engineering technology the ridiculously
01:21:25 awesome people you're bringing every week to your podcast i mean this is the ancient greece of
01:21:30 modern society but the weather still sucks because no let me put it this way the weather gives
01:21:37 us a range of emotion the full range the full scenic pattern
01:21:43 that's such a fascinating thing about human psychology i've i often reread this book i'm not sure if you're
01:21:48 familiar with this man's search for meaning by viktor frankl and  he talks
01:21:58 about you know his  living through the holocaust and in the concentration camps
01:22:04 and even there where there's like human misery is at its  highest even there he discovers these moments
01:22:16 by observing the suffering by accepting the suffering he  he observes moments of
01:22:26 true joy of how great his life is relative to others at the camp  who have it worse yeah so so
01:22:34 it's it's a dangerous liberty slope to think that way because it's basically being better than jones's
01:22:39 and if you know if the the house next door has a giant car then you want to get a bigger car or
01:22:44 something like that it's not comparative misery i think the way that i see it is slightly
01:22:52 different it's and it's not even thinking about all the worst possible outcomes
01:22:59 that could have happened but didn't the the example as you were talking about the concentration camps the most horrible
01:23:04 i mean one of the most horrible moments of human existence i was thinking about pictures that i was seeing of kids in
01:23:09 syria in war-torn zones and you're looking at these kids
01:23:16 and again i cried out loud imagining my own son in the van after a bomb explosion
01:23:27 watching his you know father die or his siblings die or losing his friends it's something that we are not
01:23:35 capable of fathoming but if you actually put a seven-year-old in that situation the look that i saw in these kids eyes
01:23:42 basically said it is what it is it was it was and and i've experienced that with my
01:23:49 own kid when he gets like my my my three-year-old last like two years ago
01:23:56 who's not my five-year-old  she was burned really badly with like hot chocolate and coffee that just
01:24:01 peeled off her skin so you could actually see just her fragile skin had just peeled off
01:24:09 and she was the happiest little kid she was just going along with the punches it is what it is
01:24:20 to sort of realize that children don't say oh i could have it better they they sort of
01:24:30 embrace the moment not embrace but sort of accept the moment and then they can have moments of pure joy
01:24:40 in a horrendous war-torn country and you know like so many people from you know these
01:24:46 war torn countries basically say oh you think you americans are going to just come and just send us a bunch of aid and food etc
01:24:55 yeah sure that's helpful but what do we dream of what do we struggle for we struggle for love we struggle for meaning
01:25:03 we struggle for you know emotions and friendships we struggle for the same things you guys struggle for
01:25:08 we're not just like every day waking up and saying oh i wish i had more food no that's just a given i just don't have
01:25:14 enough food but what we struggle with are basically everything else and that sort of gives you some perspective
01:25:22 on life it basically says you know and another story that my mom told me when i was a kid is this story about sort of this
01:25:30 man who's basically you know see he sees the christ up here in front of him and he says oh christ i'm carrying
01:25:36 all these problems i'm carrying this big bag can you please take it from me and he's like sure let me just give you any other bag
01:25:46 and basically you know the person in the end except his own bag so acceptance
01:25:53 ultimately recommended acceptance every single other bag is probably worse it's the evil you don't know
01:25:59 versus the evil you know like we all struggle with our own problems but if you look at the bigger picture
01:26:06 it's just your path through life and if you embrace it the good and the bad every single day
01:26:14 it's just joy elation sadness misery if you don't have both you're not
01:26:24 a complete human being you know you can't i mean the last example i'm going to give is the movie
01:26:31 inside out by pixar beautiful movie which one is that the one with the little characters controlling
01:26:38 all the emotions so you basically have joy and sadness and fear and disgust etc and the moral of the story if you
01:26:46 remember the movie the moral of the story is that in the end joy is basically trying to fix everything to make
01:26:51 everything happy and she's failing miserably and everything else is like crumbling and
01:26:55 falling apart and the little girl basically becomes emotionless because all she knows how to
01:27:01 do is fake happiness and i think it's a very good analogy for our everyday society
01:27:06 where we're always saying are you happy are you happy my mom calls me and she's like manolas are you happy i'm like mom
01:27:12 stop asking this stupid question no i'm not happy yeah what you should be asking is if i'm
01:27:17 fulfilled yeah and that's a very different thing i don't go around being happy i wouldn't love it if your mom called
01:27:23 and said manolas are you suffering beautifully that's exactly right that's what she
01:27:29 should be asking are you are you struggling to achieve something great
01:27:34 yeah that's the question that your mom should be asking not only did that mom call me about the suffering not about
01:27:38 how good  how good are you doing so what i tell her is that life is not about maximizing happiness
01:27:46 life is about accomplishing something meaningful and accomplishing that meaningful thing cannot come from
01:27:53 a series of joyful moments it comes from a series of struggles of successes and failures
01:28:00 of people being nasty to you and people being nice to you and embracing the full thing and if you supersede
01:28:08 that constant need for gratification if you supersede that constant need for kindness you suddenly know you who you are
01:28:17 and what i like to say to my kid and my son the other day was telling me oh so-and-so called me such and such and
01:28:21 i'm like are you such and such he's like no i'm like ha ha
01:28:26 see they were wrong and what i tell him is if you know who you are what other people say about you only
01:28:32 teaches you about them yeah so it has no influence on your self-esteem
01:28:43 if you know where you stand you embrace the good but you also embrace the bad i have plenty of bad and i'm embracing it
01:28:51 i'm a procrastinator how do i deal with that i trick myself into procrastinating about mindless stupid little
01:28:59 day-to-day things and in that procrastination time doing important things for the future
01:29:05 so accepting who you are accepting your flaws accepting the whole of it accepting the struggle accepting the sleeplessness
01:29:14 accepting the fact that the journey is what matters hoping that your path to ithaca is full
01:29:19 of troubles because those troubles are the life you will lead
01:29:26 accepting that life will not start after the next milestone that life has already started a long time ago
01:29:33 and what you're experiencing now is the life this is it it's not some kind of future thing that you work yourself hard to get to
01:29:40 and then after that you'll live hyperello happily ever after to me the happily ever after that's the
01:29:46 end of the story nothing happens after that they struggled and the struggle and the struggle is much more interesting story than
01:29:54 they lived happily ever after so i think we have to embrace that as a as a society that it's not just about the
01:30:00 happy ending that our kids are brainwashed into expecting that things will be happy and rosy and it's
01:30:07 okay if they're not and they should keep struggling because the struggle is the journey and the journey
01:30:15 is the meaning of life it's not the end it's the journey what about accepting one of the harder
01:30:21 things we talked a little bit about immortality what about accepting that life ends so do you monoliths think about your own mortality
01:30:35 how we talked about accepting that there's ups and downs to life what about the ultimate down which is
01:30:41 the finality of it do you think about that do you fear it you also ask me if i'm afraid of getting older
01:30:51 yes and that's on the path to mortality so let me talk about that first step and then the last step literally
01:30:59 the last step so getting older what does that mean when i was 18 when i was 20 my brain
01:31:07 i felt was at my maximum i was like nothing is impossible i can solve anything i could take
01:31:13 any math puzzle any logic puzzle any programming puzzle and to solve it in milliseconds i just saw the answer through problems i
01:31:19 was like feeling invincible i would show up at lecture with my newspaper lift up my head every now and then point
01:31:26 to errors just brat complete brat i would raise my hand and correct my professors from the whole classroom
01:31:32 total brand i have some of those in my class now and it's awesome it's like very huge i used to be you teaching you
01:31:37 humility yeah so so so so i felt invincible and i was like this is it this is
01:31:45 awesome i'm living the life 10 years later my brain didn't work the same way
01:31:51 i wasn't as good at the tiny little puzzles but it worked in different ways and right now
01:31:58 20 years later it works in yet different ways and oh gosh i love the journey can you maybe give some hints of the interesting
01:32:09 different ways that your brain works as it aged yeah i went from the phase of sheer speed
01:32:18 and hardcore quantitative thinking to sort of stepping back being able to sort of make more connections
01:32:24 being able to sort of say yeah but let's use that thing sort of a huge new creativity being unleashed
01:32:30 basically when you're young you're sort of thinking about that one problem you can sort of reconfigure all the
01:32:35 variables combinatorially in your head and just wipe it all out when you're you know
01:32:39 just a little older you start getting more creative you start bringing in things from different
01:32:44 fields and different contexts and sort of stepping outside the box basically it's like being in the
01:32:49 rat race and saying there's a ceiling why are we trying to get through that so it's sort of
01:32:55 look you know thinking outside the box and then at 40 what i'm going through now is this whole
01:33:02 sort of embracing the path of life and when i say life has started already it's not a test anymore
01:33:11 this is basically embracing the finality embracing that the journey is what it's at so what i like to say is live every day
01:33:20 as if it's your last one and make plans as if you'll never die i always have the long term that i'm
01:33:30 you know sort of planning out for that will eventually become the short term and i always have the sort of short term
01:33:37 and i think this ability to sort of look at life in the back in the past and look at life in the
01:33:41 future jointly and sort of embrace the continuity both of life in the universe
01:33:48 and on our planet as well as life as a human being from the beginning to the end just as a
01:33:52 path as a journey and just embracing every aspect of that i mean i was talking about parenthood
01:33:58 the other day and how amazingly fulfilling it is to sort of relive childhood through the eyes of my kid but with the perspective
01:34:10 of a parent so the the arrogance of youth yeah watching this in my kid
01:34:21 i can see myself when i was 18 correcting my professor i felt so proud yeah little did i know that my professor
01:34:27 was working on so much more interesting things than the three little things he was putting on
01:34:31 the board that day and i was like i'm invincible but in fact no just a little brat and basically right now
01:34:40 i i sort of can see the the the sort of journey with a little more humility
01:34:46 i can sort of look at my own students with their unbelievable abilities being able to do
01:34:52 things that i'm no longer able to do better than i probably was ever able to do but yet
01:34:58 being able to guide them and shape their thinking and blow their minds with new ideas and new directions
01:35:07 through my perspective and i know when something is solvable because i've been there but i'm not going to even bother it's
01:35:12 not that i can't do it i'm sure i could if i tried i just i'm not interested in that anymore
01:35:18 so what i'm embracing this journey of aging is how my brain is changing and how i'm constantly trying to figure out the
01:35:26 niches the evolutionary niches that i'm best adapted for for the tasks that i'm best at
01:35:35 while hiring and recruiting both assistants and research scientists and students and postdocs and you know
01:35:43 that will be the best at those tasks so but someone still has to see the big picture and i love being in that role so you're at
01:35:51 the at the time scale of a human lifespan you're doing the same thing that the worm
01:35:57 did at the evolutionary time scale of  growing arms of the specialization the car compartmentalization
01:36:03 right he talks about i mean it's fascinating to think of what  80 year old menolas would look back
01:36:09 at the at the man that's sitting here today and and and laugh at the ceiling at the
01:36:17 arrogance finally figured out something i was like no little thing you didn't figure out anything
01:36:23 i mean ultimately it seems that if you're introspective about life it all it leads to a kind of acceptance
01:36:32 a deeper and deeper acceptance of the whole of it there again i want to be cautious about
01:36:37 acceptance because it almost says that you can't change it ah yeah it's it's sort of embracing the struggle
01:36:44 and embracing the journey is the way that i would put it so you ultimately feel the
01:36:47 journey isn't just something that happens to you your horse you shape it you shape it remember how i
01:36:53 was saying that boston is the best place and the best time to live in right now you know in the history of humanity
01:36:59 i'm exaggerating a little bit but the way that i think about this is that if you look at the hub in the whole
01:37:06 of cosmos where would you rather be if you're just a bunch of molecules roughly your
01:37:11 you know biomass where would you rather be would you rather be a rock on mars probably not would you rather be in a
01:37:17 black hole probably not would you rather be an exploding supernova maybe that might be interesting
01:37:24 but being on earth is an awesome solar system an awesome planetary system an awesome you know place to be in
01:37:32 across all of space time it's a pretty good place to be in as a bunch of molecules if you are a bunch of molecules on earth
01:37:37 today being an animal with you know some kind of awareness of the stuff around you is
01:37:45 wonderful being a human among all animals is amazing because you have all this introspection and being a human who's young fit athletic
01:37:57 smart etc i mean you know you have so much to be happy for beyond that being surrounded
01:38:04 by a bunch of awesome people that you interact with all the time i mean i feel blessed to interact with
01:38:09 the people i know the friends i have the dinners that i have all of this the students that i interact
01:38:13 with i'm so blessed and the last little little blip in this awesomeness of local maximum
01:38:21 the last little blip comes from being kind being grateful and being kind i don't know if you remember that little prayer
01:38:28 that i described last time of thank you for all the good you've given me
01:38:35 and give me strength to give unto others with the same love that you've given to me and
01:38:40 and the whole point of that is being grateful and being kind what does that do from a purely egoistic
01:38:48 perspective it makes the people around you happier and it takes that little maximum a
01:38:53 little bit further because you'll be surrounded by happy people by being kind
01:38:59 that's the purely egoistic view and the purely altruistic view or maybe it's egoistic as well is that
01:39:05 it just it's good to give it feels good to give like basically watching somebody who's touched by what
01:39:13 you said watching somebody who's like appreciating a rapid response or a generous offer or just
01:39:21 random acts of kindness is so fulfilling so evolutionarily we were selected for that they're just such a good feeling that
01:39:28 comes from that you know it's fascinating to think you said boston is the best place
01:39:35 and talking about kindness that the very thought that boston is the place best place in the universe
01:39:44 is almost it's a kind of a gravitational field  like your thought and your very life in itself is a kind
01:39:52 of field that makes that real yeah so the self-fulfilling prophecy yeah and
01:39:58 by by claiming it's the best and thinking is the best it becomes the best and you make others
01:40:03 it's it's a for it's not a force that just applies to your own cognition exactly it applies to the
01:40:09 others around you and then suddenly you live in an even better place yeah and because you it
01:40:13 creates the reality the actual reality that the the social reality exactly it molds the environment exactly
01:40:21 what's one of the coolest things about you i think is  you represent
01:40:31  the best of mit like the spirit of mit there's so i'm i'm so glad that i'm fortunate enough to be able to
01:40:40 talk to you because you know there's a kind of  cynicism about academia in parts
01:40:51 that i think is undeserved and that that there's a you know mit of course but academic institutions
01:41:00 is a sacred place where ideas can flourish and just in the same very way that you're talking about
01:41:07 is both kindness and  curiosity and that like that weird thing that happens when a bunch of
01:41:15 curious descendants of apes get together and just like get excited and this this  
01:41:22 ripple effect that happens i mean that's the most beautiful aspect of mit people might think like
01:41:28 competition and grants and like  position like you said the rat race but like underneath it all
01:41:36 is is these curious human beings inspiring younger human beings and there's this  ripple effect that
01:41:43 happens and i'm so glad that i mean i'm glad that you that i get a chance to record this
01:41:50 because it inspires so many other students and so many other people  to do the same to embrace the the
01:41:56 inner curious creature that's not about the race so let's talk about the negatives
01:42:01 let's talk about no no no i'm serious i'm serious wait you know you have to embrace the good and the bad
01:42:05 so let's talk about the negative as degree comes up let's address it so why do people want positions of power
01:42:14 why do people want you know more money more power more this more that remember the part where i was saying if
01:42:19 you know who you are what other people think about you it makes no difference to you it only
01:42:25 teaches you about them many people feel define themselves they feel
01:42:35 instantiated through the eyes of others so being in a position of power makes them feel better about themselves
01:42:42 who knows what other kind of struggles they might have that creates that need to feel better
01:42:47 about themselves but they have a bunch of struggles and everybody has a bunch of struggles and
01:42:52 every time i see somebody behaving poorly i'm basically thinking well they're in a tough spot
01:42:58 right now and and it's okay you know i can i can kind of see how i would behave badly
01:43:06 in other circumstances as well so i think if you take away that sort of having to prove yourself
01:43:16 in the eyes of others life becomes so much easier so when i first became a professor at mit
01:43:23 i started wearing adult clothes i had my like you know i mean before i became a serious person
01:43:29 i i basically had you know i would i would always like go around in my rollerblades and my shorts and a t-shirt
01:43:33 and eventually i was a professional like oh i bought all these khaki pants and you know this nice
01:43:40 like you know shirts with like you know whatever they call it the patterns and i was like you know
01:43:45 dressing with my nice belt every day showing up and then a few months later i was like i
01:43:51 can't stand it and i just went back to my rollerblades and my t-shirts and my shirts and it was
01:43:58 this struggle of sort of not feeling that i fit in i was so intimidated by all of my colleagues
01:44:05 like just watching their incredible achievements like persons next to me and the person
01:44:10 you know the floor below me i was like oh my god like they clearly made a mistake what the
01:44:15 heck am i doing here how will i ever live up to these people's standards and um
01:44:27 eventually you grow up to realize that the way that i i grew up to realize that the way that other people perceived my work
01:44:33 was very similar to the way that i perceived other people's work as flawless i knew all of the flaws in my work i knew
01:44:43 the limitations i knew what i hadn't managed to achieve and what i saw was maybe a third of the
01:44:49 way of what i was trying to achieve and i saw everything as flawed what they saw was what i had achieved
01:44:55 they didn't see what i hadn't achieved they only saw the one-third down which was pretty good in their eyes
01:45:02 so they all respected me and i was feeling miserable about myself i was like i'm not worthy and i think that
01:45:11 this is a cognitive problem that we have we kind of it's kind of like when we're talking
01:45:16 about artificial general intelligence agi of sort of we kind of have this definition that anything that machines
01:45:20 can do is not intelligent right and anything that they can't do is intelligent therefore
01:45:26 we narrow in our narrow narrow the field of what intelligence truly means and as soon as machine learning not intelligent anymore
01:45:31 i feel like i was doing the same thing with myself as soon as i could solve something it was the kind of thing that a kid like
01:45:38 me could solve and therefore it was kind of easy but to the others it seemed hard yeah
01:45:44 but to me it seemed easy so it was this kind of thing that everything that my colleagues were doing
01:45:50 seemed impossible to me but everything that i was doing seemed impossible to them so it was that realization that sort of
01:45:55 made me mature into sort of a not more confident but more comfortable
01:46:01 human being can you actually linger on that a little bit i mean you mentioned minsky remember he said
01:46:07 something in an interview where he said the secret to his like the way he approached life was
01:46:18 to never be happy with anything he did so there's a something powerful as a motivator to to  doing exactly what you're
01:46:25 saying which is everything you've achieved to see that as easy and unimpressive what do you do with that because clearly
01:46:33 that's a i think useful thing i think i've kind of matured past that
01:46:39 and i think the maturity past that is to sort of accept what it is and accept that
01:46:48 it has helped others build onto it and therefore advance human knowledge so it's very easy to sort of fall into the
01:46:55 trap of oh everything i've done is crap what i told you last time is that i always tell my students that our best
01:47:01 work is ahead of us and i think that's more of my mindset that's a beautiful way to put it
01:47:09 exactly what we've done is it's great it's great for the time and it'll become obsolete in 30 years
01:47:15 yeah not we can we are doing even better we're doing it exactly so basically our next work will just
01:47:22 strive and and again you can't you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good at some point you have to rap i was
01:47:27 having a meeting with my student yesterday and it was like listen we know this is not perfect
01:47:34 but it's way better than anything that's ever been done before you know how to improve it but if you
01:47:39 try to your paper is never going to get published so
01:47:46 so it you know there's this balance of we're already at the top of the field get it out
01:47:52 and then you work on the next improvement and in my experience this has never happened we've never actually
01:47:57 worked on the next improvement and that's okay it didn't make a difference because
01:48:02 you're basically putting a new stepping stone that others will be able to step on and surpass you
01:48:09 my advisor in grad school would basically tell me manolis let others write the second
01:48:14 paper in that field just write the first one move on move on to the next field
01:48:20 you don't want to be writing the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth paper in the same field
01:48:27 just it's very shocking to a student to hear that because i was like i was at the top of
01:48:31 my game i was owning that field and i published the first paper i'm like
01:48:35 i'm ready for two and three and four he's like move on just let it be and i was like whoa and it's so liberating
01:48:45 to sort of not have to surpass everyone but just just put your little stepping stone out there
01:48:51 and others will step on it and put their own stones further and eventually cross a bigger river
01:48:56 than if you try to sort of make a giant leap all at once so you need both beautifully put
01:49:04 so the funny thing is  i've  i believe i closed the previous episode with a darwin quote about
01:49:11  the power of poetry and music and life i think your quote and again i only heard once was
01:49:17 darwin basically saying if i were to live life again next time i would read more poetry and
01:49:23 something about art every week or something like that yeah yeah it's so interesting for somebody
01:49:29 who studied  life at a very cold i would say genetic level to say that
01:49:38 yeah the the highest form of living is is the art but like on that which made me realize that you write poetry
01:49:44 and i  forced you or maybe convinced you somehow to  to maybe share if it's possible if
01:49:52 it's okay some of  the poetry you've written yourself in your life so again being greek
01:50:01 a lot of my poems have been pretty miserable and  i always like to say that it's very hard for me to write a poem without
01:50:08 when i'm happy and i just have to be in a state of deep despair in order to write poems but the
01:50:16 first poem i ever wrote was in  english class i was i'm in greek i grew up in kris but i was
01:50:22 in a french high school and i was taking english as a foreign language so the english teacher basically asked
01:50:28 us to write a poem in english so this is basically what  what i'm going to embarrass myself and
01:50:35 read from my 16 year old self many many years ago can you give a little bit more context about who you
01:50:40 were in this moment so like just so so here's what's really interesting in terms of growing up
01:50:48 how do we grow up it's very difficult to grow up if you're in the same school going from one class
01:50:53 to the other and all your friends know you inside out it's very difficult to change
01:50:58 it's very difficult to to grow up because they have a certain set of expectations for who you are
01:51:03 and for how you're going to behave so in in many ways we kind of tend to get set in our ways and not
01:51:09 change very much i think something that helped me grow up is that when i was
01:51:17 11 years old i was a kid in greece in primary school when i was 12 years old i was a kid in greece
01:51:24 in a you know first year of high school when i was 13 i was in france so basically moved countries and schools
01:51:33 the next year i moved schools again because it was a transition in the french educational system from one
01:51:37 school to the next the next year after that my family moved to new york in a french high school there
01:51:42 and then the next day after that i'm moving to mit  so basically between 11 and 19 every single year
01:51:51 i actually had the opportunity to grow i was not held by people who knew me
01:51:57 and i could reinvent myself or reshape myself or reshape my you know sort of personality my emotions
01:52:03 my you know as i was growing up especially in such a transformative time of a kid's life
01:52:09 from 11 to 17. okay first of all it's so powerful that you think of it that way did you think of it that way at the moment
01:52:15 because it's kind of a source you said an opportunity to grow it's kind of suffering i mean you're
01:52:21 being torn away from the thing you know into a thing you don't know so when we moved from south france to
01:52:28 new york i was pissed i was pissed i i was taking these long bike rides in the countryside
01:52:36 jumping in friends swimming pools and i had all these wonderful friendships going downtown and just
01:52:42 staying by the fountains in the dim lit streets of exxon provence in the south of france it was
01:52:49 magical and suddenly i moved to new york city a city of cement of ugliness like trash in the streets and every
01:52:57 corner is horrible snow everywhere having never seen snow or like real snow in my life
01:53:03 i moved from athens to south france to southern new york so i was pissed but whether i saw it as an
01:53:10 opportunity for growth i don't think so i don't think that i was that self-reflective it was just only now you
01:53:15 see it this way i i saw it like that probably pretty early on but not
01:53:21 during those transitions so basically during this transition i was just a kid being a kid you know and um
01:53:29 maybe the time that i started seeing it that way was maybe when i decided to stay at mit as a professor
01:53:37 after having been there as a student and i kind of saw the struggle of getting professors to
01:53:43 not see you as a kid when they're your peers and i was very flattered when one of my 
01:53:51 friends basically told me oh i remember you in recitation when you first asked me a question
01:53:59 i said wow this kid i'll pay attention one day it'll be a pier so so it's it's you know
01:54:04 certainly my perception was that many of them could not see me as anything but a kid but it turns out that some of them saw
01:54:10 me as something different than a kid even before i was actually their colleague so it's it's kind of an interesting place because
01:54:17 what i like to say about mit is that people treat you as equal no matter what stage and they respect
01:54:25 you for what you say not for who you are when you're saying it and if i'm wrong my students will tell
01:54:29 me they will have no reservation to just be bluntly you know sorry i don't agree with that
01:54:39 yeah i mean the the beautiful thing  about you sorry to to put it this way is 
01:54:45 you know maybe people who weren't familiar with your work beforehand might think  like
01:54:52 you might not realize that you're a world-class scientist leads a large group and so on
01:54:57 they because there's a youthful nature to you that it's i mean you talk like a like a first
01:55:03 like an undergrad you know with the excitement and the fresh eyes and the sort of
01:55:08 excitement about the world and that's first of all super contagious and beautiful you know it's easy to sort of
01:55:13 fall into  behaving seriously because then people kind of start putting you on a pedestal
01:55:24 more into a position of power you you want to sort of act like you're in a position of power
01:55:29 as opposed to allowing yourself to be lost in the just the curiosity the
01:55:35 the childish view of the world which is just this open-eyed love of knowledge and that was the
01:55:41 transition that i was describing when i decided to go back to my rollerblades and t-shirt and
01:55:47 baseball cap basically you know when when i met my first postdoc  it was basically you know he was interviewing for
01:55:55 postdocs at mit he already had several first author papers to his name in top journals and my friend julia basically introduced
01:56:01 me to to to alex stark who basically was interviewing at the time with rick young
01:56:05 and with eric lander just like these massive names in the field
01:56:10 and i was just a first-year faculty person with you know zero credibility and
01:56:17 she basically says oh there's this friend of mine alex who's visiting he's also german
01:56:20 you know he wanted to meet you i'm like oh sounds great i'd love to talk science i show up we sit at the amphitheater in
01:56:26 stata  you know i basically arrive in my rollerblades you know jump a few steps sit down
01:56:34 wearing my blades we're having this awesome conversation about science and about gene regulation and how the whole
01:56:39 thing works and sort of you know my perspective and his perspective or just bouncing ideas for
01:56:43 30 minutes and then i just dash off to my next meeting and he basically emails me afterwards
01:56:49 and i was giving him advice about how to interview with eric lander how to interview with rick young and how to
01:56:54 sort of get a position with them and then after  after a while he emails me saying i would love to become
01:56:59 a postdoc in your group i'm like what are you kidding me like wow so so 
01:57:09 he basically didn't care that i would wear roller blades and t-shirt all he cared about was my ideas
01:57:13 and sort of embracing the me with the childhood excitement about science was basically
01:57:21 what attracted him it wasn't the wow this guy runs a big lab or this and that
01:57:27 he was just like i like his ideas i want to work with him that by the way folks is the best of mit
01:57:32 that's what mit stands for so that's a beaut that's a beautiful story but take me back to the poem
01:57:38 and where did this poem come from what now where's your mind's set so who's the 17 16 year old kid manolas
01:57:46 so  again i've i've just seen snow for the first time and i'm is this new york this is new
01:57:50 york so i'm you know maybe that's where the sadness in the poem comes from but anyway
01:57:56 we're asked in class to write an assignment this is my third language i'm not very good at it
01:58:03 so pardon me but here's what i wrote children dance now all in row children laughing at the snow but in times endless flow
01:58:13 children sooner or later grow men are mortal we go by if we know it we may cry but i thought a love so sweet was
01:58:21 immortal was so deep there i told you darling sweet that forever love would keep
01:58:29 blossomed spring and summer shined then blue autumn winter died one year passed but the clouds still remember all our vows
01:58:39 never faked and never lied all we did was stare and smile all alone sitting down
01:58:47 to the snow we made our vow but you told me you were right birds who love are birds who cry
01:58:55 now with laughter children play yet the sky is so grey even if the snow seems bright without
01:59:03 you have lost their light sun that sang and moon that smiled all the stars have ceased to shine
01:59:11 all of nature drew its grace found its light within your face now you're gone and won't return let the snow
01:59:20 and my heart burn there's a greek that's beautiful that's beautiful by the way and and the rhyming the musicality
01:59:28 there's a there's a both of simplicity i'm language no no no but like i so i really enjoy like
01:59:34 robert frost poems i don't mean simplicity so what a bad way and then a negative way again it's
01:59:39 very weird to analyze your own poem but i think it captures the simplicity of youth and the way that it kind of
01:59:44 starts with children dance line only though it basically and it kind of shows that snow can be
01:59:49 interpreted first in the first verse as a happy thing and then in the end you know
01:59:57 now with laughter children play i'm like now i've grown basically it's it's this transformation that we're
02:00:02 actually talking about this whole men are mortal we go by i'm sort of you know you're saying are
02:00:07 you comfortable with growing old i'm like duh i was i was since i was 16. yeah and what's really interesting is that
02:00:14 you know again when i was 12 years old in our summer house in greece i remember sort of telling my sister
02:00:21 my outlook that i would have as a father for how to bring up my own kids so it's very weird that i've always sort
02:00:27 of seen the full path from you know a kid when you were young yeah i don't know if you you like this
02:00:33 johnny mitchell song i've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down
02:00:39 and still somehow it's those illusions i recall it yeah it's clouds illusions i recall i really don't know clouds at all
02:00:46 so it's it's really beautiful so so i think the johnny mitchell song which again i heard for the first time much
02:00:49 much after this and i wouldn't even compare this to that but what johnny mitch is saying
02:00:54 that song is that you can see life from two perspectives you can see the good or the bad in both
02:01:03 you know in everything you see and i think that's the allegory of snow right now you can see snow
02:01:09 as this bright white wonderful thing or you can see snow as this miserable you know gray thing so that sort of
02:01:17 and what i like about the last verse now with laughter children play is that it's a recall to the first one
02:01:22 where i was the kid enjoying careless life and eventually was making promises that
02:01:28 something would be forever and i think part of that is also the loss of my friendships in france
02:01:34 of being in new york now and sort of everything is gray and you know even though the snow seems bright
02:01:40 without you have lost their light some that sang and moon that's mild so it's this this concept that if you
02:01:48 lose your love the same thing can be perceived in a very different way
02:01:54 let me ask you this because somebody wrote me this long email and i think you're the perfect person to
02:02:09 from a genetic perspective what what's what is it what what do you make of love why why are we
02:02:17 why do we humans fall in love in your own life why did you fall in love you know
02:02:24 the email that was written to me was you always talk about mortality and fear of mortality
02:02:33 but you don't ask about love some i don't know if there's some thoughts you could give about
02:02:41 the role of love in your own life or the role of life the role of love in human life in general i think
02:02:51 love in many ways defines my life it's basically i like to say that i'm a human first and a professor
02:03:00 second and  i think this passion for life this passion for you know everything around us
02:03:05 i mean the only way to describe that is love it's basically you know embracing your
02:03:15 you know emotional self embracing the you know the the the non brainiac in you embracing the
02:03:28 sort of intangible the not very well defined and even in my on my own research i'm just very passionate
02:03:35 about everything i do and you know there's a certain passion that comes through and what
02:03:40 i'm sorry again being greek the etymology of the word passion what was passion passion is suffering
02:03:48 the etymology when we talk about the passion of the christ it's the suffering yeah and in the greek version of that
02:03:53 word pathos like pathology pathos is deep suffering it's the concept and
02:04:03 someone who's sympathetic sympathetic means suffering together experiencing emotions together so it's
02:04:09 funny that you ask me about love and i respond with passion passion for life passion for research
02:04:15 passion for my family for my children for you know so there's there's a certain
02:04:23 passion that  defines me and everything else follows rather than the other way around i'm not
02:04:30 first thinking with my brain what is the most impactful people we could write and then going after that i'm thinking
02:04:35 with my heart what am i passionate about what drives me which just like you know makes me take
02:04:41 and that's a beautiful way to live but i i love it how the greek part of you just kind of connects it to the suffering so
02:04:48 if you could remove the suffering no no no no when i say suffering i don't mean suffering as in being miserable
02:04:56 i mean suffering as in being emotionally invested in something remember i mean again if you if you look
02:05:01 at this poem what is it saying it's saying birds who love are birds who cry right it's that's the very definition of love
02:05:14 exposing your fragility if you're not afraid of suffering you don't fall in love as soon as you
02:05:20 hold back you protect you shield your heart no love can enter
02:05:28 so there's this  simon garfunkel song i am a rock i am an island and a rock feels no pain and an island
02:05:38 never cries so again there's some aspect of that into this poem the you know the fact that
02:05:46 you know but you told me you know there i told you darling sweet that forever love would keep is this
02:05:50 intermediate thing and then there's a recall but you told me you were right birds could love or burst who cry
02:05:56 so it basically says that love is the fragility that you're willing to give to another person it's opening up your
02:06:06  vulnerable spots it's sort of accepting that there's no safety net you're just giving yourself fully and
02:06:15 you're ready to be hurt so you've already been way too kind with your time but i'm gonna force you to
02:06:21 stay here just a few minutes longer as we're talking about  goodbyes you have a really nice other
02:06:27 poem here about goodbyes can i force you to read it as well
02:06:34 oh twist my arm twist my arm so and the next poem was written  specifically for our high
02:06:40 school yearbook so  another poem written on demand the rest of them are just so miserable
02:06:47 written by pure you know sadness and melancholy but this one was also written on demand
02:06:54 and it was basically saying goodbye as it's appropriate right now to my friends and sort of again
02:06:59 reflecting this whole journey and transformation through life and also i think showing a little bit of introspection
02:07:07 about how we kind of had it easy in high school and we're about to go into rougher waters so the title is actually the tidewaters
02:07:16 and it's an analogy on that so here it goes all this was another lake where some rest we sailer stake water's calm and full of fish
02:07:27 we'll find there what we wish some seek fruit and others feast some of us just look for peace
02:07:35 some find fresh other love some seek both and neither have we were different when we came
02:07:42 it's his own story and fame different people had we been different cultures had we seen different nature
02:07:49 different faiths each unlike all in this place we had faced success defeat that in one lake came to meet there the orders that we followed
02:08:01 and the pride that we swallowed made us one but not the same joined us strangers who there came
02:08:10 sooner later groups were made tribes where differences will fade some attached more or less
02:08:17 others fought and made a mess but again we have to go what for where to we don't know still we know
02:08:25 it we will try there to rush to flee to fly there'll be some who wish to stay but will carry on away we will continue
02:08:32 on our journey as we came here strong yet lonely from the lake a river flows from the
02:08:39 river many goals on that river we will race each will try to find his pace
02:08:46 in that scene the sailors face their first fear defeat disgrace here and there comes out a face that the waters
02:08:56 soon embrace some get lucky find their way others sink beneath the waves in this race we will part some will settle
02:09:06 near the start some set goals beyond the stars because the river carries far you should know in what we've done the hard part is
02:09:15 still to come so i'll have to say goodbye don't you worry i won't cry neither will they those who try
02:09:26 till the end to keep their pride but please know dearest friends who are always there to mend
02:09:33 i will always need your hand i will miss you till the end i don't think there's a better way to end it
