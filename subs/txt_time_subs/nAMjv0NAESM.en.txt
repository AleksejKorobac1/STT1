00:00:01 the following is the conversation with scott anderson his second time on the podcast he is a professor at ut austin director
00:00:10 of the quantum information center and previously a professor at mit last time we talked about quantum
00:00:17 computing this time we talk about computation complexity consciousness and theories of everything i'm recording
00:00:25 this intro as you may be able to tell in a very strange room in the middle of the night
00:00:36 i'm not really sure how i got here or how i'm going to get out but hunters thompson saying i think applies
00:00:44 to today and the last few days and actually the last couple of weeks life should not be a journey to the grave
00:00:53 with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body but rather to skid and broadside in a
00:00:59 cloud of smoke thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow
00:01:10 what a ride so i figured whatever i'm up to here and yes lots of wine is involved i'm
00:01:15 gonna have to improvise hence this recording okay quick mention of each sponsor
00:01:21 followed by some thoughts related to the episode first sponsor is simply safe a home security company i use to monitor
00:01:29 and protect my apartment though of course i'm always prepared with a
00:01:36 fallback plan as a man in this world must always be second sponsor is eight sleep a mattress
00:01:44 that cools itself measures heart rate variability has a nap and has given me yet another reason to
00:01:51 look forward to sleep including the all-important power nap third sponsor is expressvpn the vpn i've
00:01:59 used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet finally the fourth sponsor is betterhelp
00:02:07 online therapy when you want to face your demons with a licensed professional not just by doing david goggins like
00:02:14 physical challenges like i seem to do on occasion please check out these sponsors in the
00:02:20 description to get a discount and to support the podcast as a side note let me say that this is the second time
00:02:26 i recorded a conversation outdoors the first one was with stephen wolfram when it was actually sunny out in this
00:02:34 case it was raining which is why i found a covered outdoor patio but i learned a valuable lesson which is that
00:02:43 raindrops can be quite loud on the hard metal surface of a patio cover i did my best with the audio
00:02:51 i hope it still sounds okay to you i'm learning always improving in fact as scott says if you always win
00:02:58 then you're probably doing something wrong to be honest i get pretty upset with myself when i fail
00:03:06 small or big but i've learned that this feeling is priceless it can be fuel when channeled into
00:03:12 concrete plans of how to improve so if you enjoy this thing subscribe on youtube review five stars

00:03:28 and now here's my conversation with scott erinson let's start with the most absurd question but i've read you write some
00:03:36 fascinating stuff about it so  let's go there are we living in a simulation what
00:03:41 difference does it make lex i mean i'm serious what difference because if we are
00:03:47 living in a simulation it raises the question how real does something have to be in stimulation for in it to be
00:03:54 sufficiently immersive for us humans but i mean even in principle how could we ever know if we were in one
00:04:00 right a perfect simulation by definition is something that's indistinguishable from the real thing well we didn't say
00:04:05 anything about perfect it could be no no that's that's right well if it was an imperfect simulation if we could hack it
00:04:12 you know find a bug in it then that would be one thing right if if this was like the matrix and there
00:04:17 was a way for me to you know do flying kung fu moves or something by hacking the simulation
00:04:22 well then you know we would have to cross that bridge when we came to it wouldn't we
00:04:27 right i mean at that point you know i it's it's  hard to see the difference between that and just 
00:04:34  what people would ordinarily refer to as a world with miracles you know  what about from a different
00:04:40 perspective thinking about the universe as a computation like a program running on a computer
00:04:46 that's kind of a neighboring concept it is it is an interesting and reasonably well-defined question to ask
00:04:52 is the world computable you know you know does the world satisfy what we would call in cs the the church
00:04:58 touring thesis yeah that is you know  could we take any physical system
00:05:05 and simulate it to  you know any desired precision by a touring machine you know given the appropriate input
00:05:11 data right and so far i think the indications are pretty strong that
00:05:16 our world does seem to satisfy the church-touring thesis  at least if it doesn't then we
00:05:22 haven't yet discovered why not  but now does that mean that our universe is a simulation
00:05:30 well you know that word seems to suggest that there is some other larger universe in which it is running
00:05:34 right right and the problem there is that if the simulation is perfect
00:05:40 then we're never going to be able to get any direct evidence about that other universe you know we
00:05:46 will only be able to see  the effects of the computation that is running in this universe
00:05:53 well let's imagine an analogy let's imagine a pc a personal computer a computer is it possible with the advent of
00:06:01 artificial intelligence for the computer to look outside of itself to see
00:06:09 to understand its creator i mean that's a simple is that is that a ridiculous connection well i mean with the
00:06:15 computers that we actually have i mean first of all  we we all know that  humans have done an imperfect
00:06:22 job of you know enforcing the abstraction boundaries of computers right like you may try to confine some
00:06:30 program to a playpen but you know as soon as there's one   memory allocation error in in the c program
00:06:39 then the program has gotten out of that play pen and it can do whatever it wants right this is how most hacks work you know
00:06:47 viruses and worms and exploits and you know you would have to imagine that an ai would be able to discover
00:06:52 something like that now you know of course if we could actually discover some
00:06:59 exploit of reality itself then you know then this whole i mean we we then in some sense we we
00:07:06 wouldn't have to philosophize about this right this would no longer be a metaphysical conversation
00:07:12 right this would just but that's the question is what is what would that hack look like yeah well i have no idea
00:07:17 i mean   peter shore  you know the you know very famous person in quantum
00:07:24 computing of course has a joked that  maybe the reason why we haven't yet you know integrated general relativity
00:07:31 in quantum mechanics is that you know the part of the universe that depends on both of them
00:07:35 was that was actually left unspecified and if we ever tried to do an experiment
00:07:42  involving the singularity of a black hole or something like that then you know the universe would just 
00:07:47 generate an overflow error or something right yeah we would just crash the universe
00:07:55 now you know the the the universe you know has seemed to hold up pretty well for you know 14 billion years right so
00:08:03 you know my  you know  occam's razor kind of guess has to be that you know it will continue to hold
00:08:11 up you know that the fact that we don't know the laws of physics governing some phenomenon is not a
00:08:16 strong sign that probing that phenomenon is going to crash the universe
00:08:22 right but you know of course i could be wrong but do you think on the physics side of things you know
00:08:27 there's been  recently a few folks eric weinstein and stephen wolfram that came out with a
00:08:34 theory of everything i think there's a history of physicists dreaming and working on
00:08:39 the unification of all the laws of physics do you think it's possible that once we understand
00:08:46  more physics not necessarily the unification of the laws but just understand physics more deeply at the
00:08:51 fundamental level we'll be able to start you know  i mean part of this is humorous but  looking
00:08:59 to see if there's any bugs in the universe that can be exploited for  you know traveling at 
00:09:06 not just speed of light but just traveling faster than our current  spaceships can travel all that kind
00:09:11 of stuff well i mean to travel faster than our current spaceships
00:09:16 could travel you wouldn't need to find any bug in the universe right the known laws of physics
00:09:21 you know let us go much faster up to the speed of light right and you know when people want to
00:09:26 go faster than the speed of light well we actually know something about what that would entail
00:09:31 namely that you know according to relativity that seems to entail communication backwards in time
00:09:39 okay so then you have to worry about  close time like curves and all of that stuff so you know in some sense we
00:09:44 we sort of know the price that you have to pay for these things right understanding of physics that's
00:09:50 right that's right we can't you know say that they're impossible but we you know we know that
00:09:57 sort of a lot else in physics breaks right so  now regarding  eric weinstein and stephen wolfram like i
00:10:05 wouldn't say that either of them has a theory of everything i would say that they have
00:10:09 ideas that they hope you know could someday lead to a theory of everything is that a worthy pursuit
00:10:16 well i mean certainly let's say by theory of everything you know we don't literally mean a
00:10:20 theory of cats and of baseball and you know but we just mean it in the
00:10:26 in the more limited sense of everything a fun a fundamental theory of physics right of
00:10:30 all of the fundamental interactions of physics of course such a theory
00:10:37 even after we had it  you know would would leave the entire question of all the emergent
00:10:41 behavior right you know to  to be explored  so it's so it's only everything for a specific
00:10:48 definition of everything okay but in that sense i would say of course that's worth pursuing
00:10:53 i mean that is the entire program of fundamental physics right all of my friends who do quantum
00:10:59 gravity who do string theory who do anything like that that is what's motivating them yeah it's
00:11:04 it's funny though but i mean eric weinstein talks about this it is i don't know much about the
00:11:09 physics world but i know about the ai world it is a little it is a little bit taboo
00:11:17  to talk about agi for example on the ai side so really to talk about  the big dream of the community i
00:11:24 would say because it seems so far away it's almost taboo to bring it up because
00:11:31  you know it's seen as the kind of people that dream about creating a truly superhuman level intelligence that's
00:11:37 really far out there people because we're not even close to that and it feels like the same thing is
00:11:41 true for the physics community i mean stephen hawking certainly talked  constantly about
00:11:48 theory of everything right    you know i mean i mean people you know used those terms who
00:11:54 were you know some of the most respected people in the in the in the whole world of physics
00:12:00 right but i mean i think that the distinction that i would make is that people
00:12:05 might react badly if you use the term in a way that suggests that that you you know thinking about it
00:12:11 for five minutes have come up with this major new insight about it yeah right it's it's difficult stephen hawk is
00:12:20 is a not a great example because i think you can do whatever the heck you want when you get to that level
00:12:26 and i certainly see like seeing your faculty you know that you know at that point that's the
00:12:32 one of the nice things about getting older is you stop giving a damn but community as a whole
00:12:38 they tend to roll their eyes very quickly at stuff that's outside the quote-unquote mainstream well well let
00:12:43 me let me put it this way i mean if you asked you know ed whitton let's say who is you know you might consider the
00:12:49 leader of the string community and thus you know very very mainstream in a certain sense but
00:12:55 he would have no hesitation in saying you know of course you know they're looking for a you know
00:13:00   you know a a a unified description of nature of you know of general relativity of
00:13:07 quantum mechanics of all the fundamental interactions of nature right now you know whether people would
00:13:14 call that a theory of everything whether they would use that that term that might vary you know lenny
00:13:19 suskin would definitely have no problem telling you that you know if that's what we want right
00:13:24 for me who loves human beings in psychology it's kind of ridiculous to say a theory that unifies the laws of
00:13:33 physics gets you to understand everything i would say you're not even close to understanding everything
00:13:39 yeah right well yeah i mean the word everything is a little ambiguous here right because you know and then people
00:13:44 will get into debates about you know reductionism versus emergentism and blah blah blah
00:13:51 and so in in not wanting to say theory of everything people might just be trying to short-circuit that debate
00:13:57 and say you know look you know yes we want a fundamental theory of you know the particles and interactions
00:14:03 of nature let me bring up the next topic that people don't want to mention although they're getting more
00:14:07 comfortable with it it's consciousness you mentioned that you have a talk on consciousness that i watched five minutes of but the
00:14:14 internet connection was really bad was this my talk about you know  refuting the integrated information theory
00:14:20 yes which is a particular account of consciousness that yeah i think one can just show it doesn't work right
00:14:25 so let me much harder to say what does work what doesn't work yeah yeah let me ask maybe it'd be nice to 
00:14:30 comment on you talk about also like the semi hard problem of consciousness or like almost
00:14:37 hard pro or kind of hard pretty pretty hard pretty hard one i think i call it so maybe can you  talk about that 
00:14:44 their idea of of the approach to modeling consciousness and why you don't find it convincing
00:14:51 what is it first of all okay well so so what what what i called the pretty hard problem of consciousness this is my
00:14:57 term although many other people have said something equivalent to this okay  but  it's just you know the the
00:15:07 problem of you know giving an account of just which physical systems are conscious and which are not
00:15:12 or you know if there are degrees of consciousness then quantifying how conscious a given system is oh awesome so that's
00:15:19 the pretty hard yeah that's what i mean that's it i'm adopting it i love it that's a good
00:15:24 a good ring to it and so you know the infamous hard problem of consciousness is to explain how
00:15:31 something like consciousness could arise at all you know in a material universe right or you know why does it ever feel
00:15:36 like anything to to experience anything right and you know so i'm trying to distinguish
00:15:43 from that problem right and say you know no okay i am i would merely settle for an account
00:15:50 that could say you know is a fetus conscious you know if so at which trimester you know is a 
00:15:57 is a dog conscious you know what about a frog right or or even as a precondition you take that both these things are conscious
00:16:04 tell me which is more conscious yeah for example yes yeah yeah i mean if consciousness is
00:16:10 some multi-dimensional vector well just tell me in which respects these things are conscious and in which respect they aren't
00:16:16 right and you know and have some principled way to do it where you're not you know carving out exceptions for
00:16:22 things that you like or don't like but could somehow take a description of an arbitrary physical system
00:16:30 and then just based on the physical properties of that system or the informational properties or how
00:16:35 it's connected or something like that just in principle calculate you know its degree of consciousness
00:16:43 right i mean this this this would be the kind of thing that we would need you know if we wanted to address
00:16:48 questions like you know what does it take for a machine to be conscious right or when or
00:16:54 you know when when when should we regard ais as being conscious so now this iit
00:17:01 this integrated information theory  which has been put forward by  giulio tanoni and a bunch of his 
00:17:11  collaborators over the last decade or two  this is noteworthy i guess as a direct attempt to answer that question
00:17:21 to you know answer the to address the pretty hard problem right and they give a  a criterion
00:17:28 that's just based on how a system is connected so you so it's up to you to sort of abstract the system like a brain
00:17:36 or a microchip as a collection of components that are connected to each other by some
00:17:42 pattern of connections you know and and to specify how the components can influence each other
00:17:48 you know like where the inputs go you know where they affect the outputs but then once you've specified that
00:17:54 then they give this quantity that they call fee you know the greek letter phi and the definition of phi is
00:17:59 actually changed over time it changes from one paper to another but in all of the variations it involves
00:18:07 something about what we in computer science would call graph expansion
00:18:12 so basically what this means is that they want it  in order to get a large value of fee 
00:18:19 it should not be possible to take your system and partition it into two components
00:18:25 that are only weakly connected to each other okay so whenever we take our system and sort of
00:18:31 try to split it up into two then there should be lots and lots of connections going between the two components
00:18:36 okay well i understand what that means on a graph do they formalize what  how to construct such a graph or
00:18:43 data structure whatever  or is this well one of the criticism  i i've heard you kind of say is that a
00:18:51 lot of the very interesting specifics are usually communicated through like natural language like like through words
00:18:58 so it's like the details aren't always well they well it's true i mean they they they they have nothing even
00:19:04 resembling a derivation of this fee okay so what they do is they state a whole bunch of postulates
00:19:11 you know axioms that they think that consciousness should satisfy and then there's some verbal discussion
00:19:17 and then at some point fee appears right right and this this was one the first thing that really made
00:19:24 the hair stand on my neck to be honest because they are acting as if there is a derivation they're acting as if you know
00:19:30 you're supposed to think that this is a derivation and there's nothing even remotely resembling
00:19:36 a derby they just pull the fee out of a hat completely is one of the key criticisms to you is that
00:19:41 details are missing or is that exactly more fun that's not even the key criticism that's
00:19:45 just that's just a side point okay the the core of it is that i think that the you know that they want to say
00:19:51 that a system is more conscious the larger its value of fee and i think that that is obvious
00:19:58 nonsense okay as soon as you think about it for like a minute as soon as you think about it in terms
00:20:03 of could i construct a system that had an enormous value of fee like you know even larger than the brain has
00:20:11 but that is just implementing an error correcting code you know doing nothing that we would
00:20:17 associate with you know intelligence or consciousness or any of it the answer is yes it is easy to do that right
00:20:24 and so i wrote blog posts just making this point that yeah it's easy to do that now you know tanoni's response to that
00:20:30 was actually kind of incredible right i mean i i admired it in a way because instead of disputing any of it he just
00:20:37 bit the bullet in the sense you know he was one of the the  the most
00:20:43  audacious bullet bitings i've ever seen in my career okay he said okay then fine
00:20:50 you know this system that just applies this error correcting code it's conscious you know and if it has a much larger
00:20:55 value of fee then you or me it's much more conscious than you want me
00:21:00 you know you we just have to accept what the theory says because you know science is not about confirming
00:21:06 our intuitions it's about challenging them and you know this is what my theory predicts that this thing is conscious and
00:21:14 you know or super duper conscious and how are you going to prove me wrong see i would
00:21:18 so the way i would argue against your blog post is i would say yes sure you're right in
00:21:23 general but for naturally arising systems developed through the process of evolution on earth
00:21:31 the this rule of the larger fee being associated being associated with more consciousness is correct
00:21:36 yeah so that's not what he said at all right right because he wants this to be completely general
00:21:41 right so we can apply to even computers yeah i mean i mean the whole interest of the theory
00:21:46 is the you know the hope that it could be completely general apply to aliens to computers to 
00:21:54  animals coma patients to any of it right yeah and   so so so he just said well
00:22:01 you know  scott is relying on his intuition but you know i'm relying on this theory
00:22:06 and you know to me it was almost like you know are we being serious here like like like you know like like okay
00:22:15 yes in science we try to learn highly non-intuitive things but what we do is we first test the theory on cases where we
00:22:22 already know the answer right like if if someone had a new theory of temperature right
00:22:28 then you know maybe we could check that it says that boiling water is hotter than ice
00:22:33 and then if it says that the sun is hotter than anything you know you've ever experienced then maybe we we trust that
00:22:40 extrapolation right but like this this theory like if if you know it it's now saying that you know a
00:22:49 a gigantic grit like regular grid of exclusive or gates can be way more conscious than a you
00:22:54 know a person or than any animal can be you know even if it
00:23:01 you know is you know is is is is so uniform that it might as just well just be a blank wall
00:23:06 right and and so now the point is if this theory is sort of getting wrong the question is a blank wall you know
00:23:12 more conscious than a person then i would say what is what is there for it to get right
00:23:19 so your sense is a blank wall  is not more conscious than a human being yeah i mean i mean i mean
00:23:24 you could say that i am taking that as one of my axioms i'm saying i'm saying that if if a
00:23:30 theory of consciousness is is get getting that wrong then whatever it is talking about at that
00:23:37 point i i i'm not going to call it consciousness i'm going to use a different word you
00:23:42 have to use a different word i mean yeah it's all it's possible just like with
00:23:46 intelligence that us humans conveniently define these very difficult to understand concepts
00:23:51 in a very human-centric way just like the touring test really seems to define intelligence as a
00:23:56 thing that's human-like right but i would say that with any  concept you know there's   
00:24:05 you know like we we we first need to define it right and a definition is only a good definition if it matches
00:24:11 what we thought we were talking about you know prior to having a definition right yeah
00:24:16 and i would say that you know  fee as a definition of consciousness fails that test that is my argument
00:24:25 so okay let's so let's take a further step so you mentioned that the universe might be
00:24:30  the touring machine so like it might be computational or simulatable by one anyway simulated by one so yeah do you what's
00:24:36 your sense about consciousness do you think consciousness is computation
00:24:43 that we don't need to go to any place outside of the computable universe to  you know to to understand
00:24:51 consciousness to build consciousness to measure consciousness all those kinds of things i don't know
00:24:57 these are what  you know have been called the the vertigonous questions right there's the questions
00:25:02 like like  you know you get a feeling of vertigo and thinking about them right
00:25:09 i mean i certainly feel like  i am conscious in a way that is not reducible to computation
00:25:15 but why should you believe me right i mean and and if you said the same to me then why should i believe you
00:25:22 but as computer scientists yeah i feel like a computer could be intel could achieve human level intelligence
00:25:30 but and that's actually a feeling and a hope that's not a scientific belief it's just we've built up enough intuition the same
00:25:37 kind of intuition you use in your blog it's you know that's what scientists do they i mean some of it is a scientific
00:25:42 method but some of it is just damn good intuition i don't have a good intuition about consciousness yeah i'm not sure that
00:25:48 anyone does or or has in the you know 2500 years that these things have been discussed lex
00:25:55  but do you think we will like one of the i got a chance to attend i can't wait to hear your opinion
00:26:01 on this but attend the neuralink event and  one of the dreams there is to  you know basically push neuroscience
00:26:09 forward and the hope with neuroscience is that we can inspect the machinery from which
00:26:16 all this fun stuff emerges and see we're going to notice something special some special sauce from which
00:26:21 something like consciousness or cognition emerges yeah well it's clear that we've learned
00:26:27 an enormous amount about neuroscience we've learned an enormous amount about computation you know about machine
00:26:32 learning about you'll know ai how to get it to work we've learned  an enormous amount about the
00:26:40 underpinnings of the physical world you know and you know it from one point of view
00:26:45 that's like an enormous distance that we've traveled along the road to understanding consciousness
00:26:50 from another point of view you know the distance still to be traveled on the road you know maybe seems no shorter than it
00:26:55 was at the beginning yeah right so it's very hard to say i mean you know these are
00:27:01 questions like like in in in sort of trying to have a theory of consciousness there's sort of a problem where it feels like
00:27:08 it's not just that we don't know how to make progress it's that it's hard to specify what could even count as progress right
00:27:15 because no matter what scientific theory someone proposed someone else could come along and say
00:27:20 well you've just talked about the mechanism you haven't said anything about what breathes fire into the mechanism
00:27:26 right really makes there's something that it's like to be it right and that seems like an
00:27:30 objection that you could always raise yes no matter you know how much someone elucidated the details of how the brain works okay
00:27:37 let's go touring tests and love the prize i have this intuition call me crazy but we
00:27:44 that a machine to pass the touring test and is full whatever the spirit of it is we can talk
00:27:50 about how to formulate the perfect touring test that that machine has to
00:27:58 be conscious or we at least have to  i have a very low bar of what consciousness is a dentist
00:28:04 i tend to think that the emulation of consciousness is as good as consciousness so like consciousness is just a dance a social
00:28:14 a social  shortcut like a nice useful tool but i tend to connect intelligence consciousness together so by
00:28:22 by that do you  maybe just to ask what  what role does consciousness play do you think in
00:28:27 passing the touring test well look i mean it's almost tautologically true that if we had a machine that passed the
00:28:34 turing test then it would be emulating consciousness right so if your position is that you know emulation of consciousness is consciousness
00:28:42 then so you know by by definition any machine that passed the touring test would be conscious
00:28:48 but it's   but i mean we know that you could say that you know that that is just a way to rephrase the original
00:28:53 question you know is an emulation of consciousness you know necessarily conscious right and you can you know
00:29:00 i hear i'm not saying anything new that hasn't been debated ad nauseum in the literature
00:29:04 okay but you know you could  imagine some very hard cases like imagine a machine
00:29:11 that passed the touring test but it did so just by an enormous cosmological sized
00:29:16 look-up table that just cached every possible conversation that could be had the old
00:29:21 chinese room well well yeah yeah but but this is   i mean i mean the chinese room
00:29:27 actually would be doing some computation at least in searle's version right here i'm just talking about a table
00:29:32 lookup okay now it's true that for conversations of a reasonable length this
00:29:37 you know lookup table would be so enormous that wouldn't even fit in the observable universe okay but supposing that you
00:29:44 could build a big enough look-up table and then just you know pass the touring test just by looking up what the person said
00:29:52 right are you going to regard that as conscious okay let me try to make this yeah yeah formal
00:29:57 and then you can shut it down i think that the emulation of something is that something if there exists in
00:30:05 that system a black box that's full of mystery so like  full of mystery to whom to  human
00:30:13 in inspectors so does that mean that consciousness is relative to the observer like could
00:30:19 something be conscious for us but not conscious for an alien that understood better what was happening
00:30:24 inside the black box yes so that if inside the black box is just a look-up table
00:30:30 the alien that saw that would say this is not conscious to us another way to phrase the black box is
00:30:35 layers of abstraction which make it very difficult to see to the actual underlying
00:30:41 functionality of the system and then we observe just the abstraction and so it looks like magic to us but
00:30:46 once we understand the inner machinery it stops being magic and so like
00:30:52 that's a prerequisite is that you can't know how it works some part of it because then there has to be in our human mind
00:31:02  entry point for the magic so that that's that's a formal definition of the system
00:31:08 yeah well look i mean i i explored a view and this essay i wrote called the ghost and the quantum touring
00:31:13 machine  seven years ago that is  related to that except that i did not want to
00:31:19 have consciousness be relative to the observer right because i think that you know if consciousness means anything
00:31:25 it is something that is experienced by the entity that is conscious right you know like i don't need you to
00:31:30 tell me that i'm conscious right nor do you need me to to to to tell you that you are right so 
00:31:39 so but but basically what i explored there is you know are there  aspects of a of a system like  like a brain
00:31:48 that  that just could not be predicted even with arbitrarily advanced future technologies yes because of chaos combined with
00:31:56 quantum mechanical uncertainty you know and things like that i mean that that actually could be a
00:32:03 a property of the brain you know if true that would distinguish it in a principled way
00:32:07 at least from any currently existing computer not from any possible computer but from yeah yeah
00:32:13 let's do a thought experiment so yeah if i gave you information that you're in the entire
00:32:20 history of your life basically explain away free will with a look-up table say that
00:32:26 this was all predetermined that everything you experienced has already been predetermined
00:32:30 wouldn't that take away your consciousness wouldn't you yourself that wouldn't experience of the world change for you
00:32:35 in a way that's you you can't well let me put it this way if you could do like in a greek
00:32:43 tragedy where you know you would just write down a prediction for what i'm going to do
00:32:48 and then maybe you put the prediction in a sealed box and maybe you know you you  open it
00:32:53 later and you show that you knew everything i was going to do or you know
00:32:57 of course the even creepier version would be you tell me the prediction and then i try to falsify it and my very
00:33:04 effort to falsify it makes it come true right but let's let's you know let's even forget that you know that version
00:33:10 is as convenient as it is for fiction writers right let's just let's just do the version where you put
00:33:15 the prediction into a sealed envelope okay but  if you could reliably predict everything that i was going to do
00:33:22 i'm not sure that that would destroy my sense of being conscious but i think it really would destroy my
00:33:28 sense of having free will you know and much much more than any philosophical conversation could
00:33:35 possibly do that right and so i think it becomes extremely interesting to ask
00:33:41 you know could such predictions be done you know even in principle is it consistent with the laws of
00:33:47 physics to make such predictions to get enough data about someone that you could actually generate such
00:33:52 predictions without having to kill them in the process to you know slice their brain up into little slivers
00:33:57 or something i mean theoretically possible right well i don't know i mean i mean it might be
00:34:02 possible but only at the cost of destroying the person right i mean it depends on how low you
00:34:08 have to go in sort of the substrate like if there was a nice
00:34:14 digital abstraction layer if you could think of each neuron as a kind of transistor computing a digital function then you
00:34:19 could imagine some nanorobots that would go in and we just scan the state of each transistor
00:34:26 you know of each neuron and then you know make a a good enough copy right but if it was actually important
00:34:33 to get down to the molecular or the atomic level then you know eventually you would be up against
00:34:39 quantum effects you would be up against the unclonability of quantum states so i think it's a question of  how
00:34:46 good of a replica how good does the replica have to be before you're going to count it as
00:34:51 actually a copy of you or as being able to predict your actions  that's a totally open question then
00:34:57 yeah yeah yeah and and especially once we say that well look maybe there's no way to pre
00:35:03 you know to make a deterministic prediction because you know there's all there you know we know that there's
00:35:09 noise buffeting the brain around presumably even quantum mechanical uncertainty you know affecting the sodium ion
00:35:16 channels for example whether they open or they close you know there's no reason why
00:35:23 over a certain time scale that shouldn't be amplified just like we imagine happens with the weather
00:35:29 or with any other you know chaotic system  so so if if that stuff
00:35:37 is is important right then  then then you know we would say  well you know you
00:35:43 you you can't   you know you're you're never going to be able to make an accurate enough copy
00:35:47 but now the hard part is well what if someone can make a copy that sort of no one else can tell apart
00:35:52 from you right it says the same kinds of things that you would have said
00:35:58 maybe not exactly the same things because we agree that there's noise but it says the same kinds of things and
00:36:04 maybe you alone would say no i know that that's not me you know it's it doesn't share my
00:36:09 i haven't felt my consciousness leap over to that other thing i still feel it localized in this
00:36:14 version right then why should anyone else believe you what are your thoughts
00:36:19 i'd be curious you're a good person to ask which is  penn rose's roger penrose's work on consciousness
00:36:27 saying that there you know there is some with axons and so on there might be some biological places where quantum
00:36:33 mechanics can come into play and through that create consciousness somehow yeah
00:36:38 okay well  familiar with his work of course you know i read penrose's books as a teenager they had a
00:36:43 huge impact on me   five or six years ago i had the privilege to actually talk these things
00:36:49 over with penrose you know at some length at a conference in minnesota and  you know he is   you know an
00:36:55 amazing  personality i admire the fact that he was even raising such  audacious
00:37:02 questions at all  but you know to to to answer your question i think the first thing we need to
00:37:09 get clear on is that he is not merely saying that quantum mechanics is relevant to consciousness
00:37:14 right that would be like you know that would be tame compared to what he is saying right he
00:37:19 is saying that you know even quantum mechanics is not good enough right if because if
00:37:24 supposing for example that the brain were a quantum computer maybe that's still a computer you know
00:37:30 in fact a quantum computer can be simulated by an ordinary computer it might merely need
00:37:35 exponentially more time in order to do so right so that's simply not good enough for him
00:37:41 okay so what he wants is for the brain to be a quantum gravitational computer or or  he wants the brain to be exploiting
00:37:52 as yet unknown laws of quantum gravity okay which would which would be uncomputable that's the key point okay yes yes that
00:38:00 would be literally uncomputable and i've asked him you know to clarify this but uncomputable
00:38:06 even if you had an oracle for the halting problem or you know and and or you know as high
00:38:12 up as you want to go and the sort of high the usual hierarchy of uncomputability he wants to go beyond all of that okay so
00:38:20 so you know just to be clear like you know if we're keeping count of how many speculations you know there's probably like at least
00:38:27 five or six of them right there's first of all that there is some quantum gravity theory that would
00:38:32 involve this kind of uncomputability right most people who study quantum gravity would not agree
00:38:37 with that they would say that what we've learned you know what little we know about
00:38:42 quantum gravity from the this ads cft correspondence for example has been very much consistent with the
00:38:51 broad idea of nature being computable right but  but all right but but supposing that he's right about that
00:38:58 then you know what most physicists would say is that whatever new phenomena there are in quantum
00:39:06 gravity you know they might be relevant at the singularities of black holes they might be relevant at the big bang
00:39:15  they are plainly not relevant to something like the brain you know that is operating at ordinary temperatures
00:39:24 you know with ordinary chemistry and you know the the the physics underlying the brain they
00:39:29 would say that we have you know the fundamental physics of the brain they would say that we've
00:39:34 pretty much completely known for for generations now right  because you know quantum field
00:39:40 theory lets us sort of parametrize our ignorance right i mean sean carroll has made this case and you
00:39:46 know in great detail right that sort of whatever new effects are coming from quantum gravity
00:39:52 you know they are sort of screened off by quantum field theory right and this is this bring you know
00:39:58 brings us to the whole idea of effective theories right but that like we have you know that in like in the standard model of
00:40:04 elementary particles right we have a quantum field theory that seems totally adequate for all of
00:40:11 the terrestrial phenomena right the only things that it doesn't you know explain
00:40:17 are well first of all you know the details of gravity if you were to probe it like at a  you
00:40:23 know extremes of you know curvature or like incredibly small distances it doesn't explain dark matter it
00:40:31 doesn't explain black hole singularities right but these are all very exotic things very you know far removed from
00:40:36 our life on earth right so for penrose to be right he needs you know these phenomena to somehow
00:40:44 affect the brain he needs the brain to contain antenna that are sensitive to the black hole to this as yet unknown physics right and
00:40:52 then he needs a modification of quantum mechanics okay so he needs
00:40:58 quantum mechanics to actually be wrong okay he needs   what what he wants is what he
00:41:04 calls an objective reduction mechanism or an objective collapse so this is the idea that once quantum states get large enough
00:41:15 then they somehow spontaneously collapse right that   you know and and this is an idea that lots of people have explored
00:41:23  you know there's  something called the grw proposal that tries to  you know
00:41:28 say something along those lines you know and these are theories that actually make testable predictions
00:41:33 right which is a nice feature that they have but you know the very fact that they're testable may mean that in the
00:41:39  you know in the in the coming decades we may well be able to test these theories and show that they're they're
00:41:43 they're wrong right  you know we may be able to test some of penrose's ideas
00:41:50 if not not his ideas about consciousness but at least his ideas that about an objective collapse of quantum states
00:41:56 right and people have actually like dick balmester have actually been working to try to do these experiments
00:42:02 they haven't been able to do it yet to attest penrose's proposal okay but penrose would need more than
00:42:09 just an objective collapse of quantum states which would already be the biggest development in physics for a century
00:42:15 since quantum mechanics itself okay he would need for consciousness to somehow be able to influence
00:42:23 the direction of the collapse so that it wouldn't be completely random but that you know your dispositions
00:42:28 would somehow influence the quantum state to collapse more likely this way or that way okay finally penrose you know says that
00:42:36 all of this has to be true because of an argument that he makes based on girdle's
00:42:42 incompleteness theorem okay right now like i would say the overwhelming majority of computer
00:42:49 scientists and mathematicians who have thought about this i don't think that girdles and completeness
00:42:54 theorem can do what he needs it to do here right i don't think that that argument is sound okay
00:43:00 but that is you know that is sort of the tower that you have to ascend to if you're going to go where penrose goes
00:43:05 and the intuition uses with  yeah the completeness theorem is that basically
00:43:11 that there's important stuff that's not computable it's not just that because i mean everyone agrees that there are problems
00:43:18 that are uncomputable right that's a mathematical theorem right that but what penrose wants to say
00:43:24 is that   you know the you know for example there are statements
00:43:31  you know for you know given any  formal system you know for doing math right there will
00:43:37 be true statements of arithmetic that that formal system you know if it's adequate for math at all
00:43:43 if it's consistent and so on will not be able to prove  a famous example being the statement
00:43:49 that that system itself is consistent right no you know good formal system can actually prove its own consistency
00:43:57 that can only be done from a stronger formal system which then can't prove its own consistency
00:44:03 and so on forever okay that's gurdle's theorem but now why is that relevant to  consciousness right   well you know
00:44:11 i mean i mean the the idea that it might have something to do with consciousness as an old one
00:44:16 girdle himself apparently thought that it didn't really you know  lucas   um
00:44:23 thought so i think in the 60s and penrose is really just you know sort of updating what what   what what they
00:44:29 and others had said i mean you know the idea that girdle's theorem could have something to do with
00:44:34 consciousness was you know in in 1950 when alan turing wrote his article
00:44:40  about the touring test he already you know was writing about that as like an old and well-known idea and as one that he
00:44:47 was as a wrong one that he wanted to dispense with okay but the basic problem with this idea is you
00:44:54 know penrose wants to say that  and and all of his predecessors your you know want to say
00:45:00 that you know even though you know this given formal system cannot prove  its own consistency we
00:45:08 as humans sort of looking at it from the outside can just somehow see its consistency right and the you know the rejoinder to that
00:45:17 you know from the very beginning has been well can we really yeah i mean maybe or maybe maybe you
00:45:22 know maybe maybe he penrose can but you know can the rest of us right  and you know i i noticed that
00:45:30 that you know i mean it is perfectly plausible to imagine
00:45:36 a computer that could say you know it would not be limited to working within a single formal system
00:45:42 right they could say i am now going to adopt the hypothesis that this that my formal system is
00:45:47 consistent right and i'm now going to see what can be done from that stronger vantage point
00:45:52 and and so on and you know when i'm going to add new axioms to my system totally plausible there's absolutely
00:45:59 gerdle's theorem has nothing to say about against an ai that could repeatedly add new axioms
00:46:07 all it says is that there is no absolute guarantee that when the ai adds new axioms that it will always be right
00:46:13 right okay and you know and that's of course the point that penrose pounces on but the reply is obvious and you know
00:46:19 it's one that that alan turing made 70 years ago name we we don't have an absolute
00:46:24 guarantee that we're right when we add a new axiom right we never have and plausibly we
00:46:28 never will so on alan turing you took part in the lobner prize
00:46:35   not really no i didn't i mean there was this   kind of ridiculous claim that was
00:46:40 made  some almost a decade ago about an a chat bot called eugene goose
00:46:47 i guess you didn't participate as a judge in the lobner prize i didn't but you participated as a judge in that
00:46:52 i guess it was an exhibition event or something like that or was eugene 
00:46:58 eugene gusman that was just me writing a blog post because some journalists called me to ask about it did you ever
00:47:03 chat with him i thought i did chat with eugene gooseman i mean it was available on the web the chat
00:47:09 oh interesting i didn't so yeah so all that happened was that  so you know a bunch of journalists
00:47:14 started writing breathless articles about you know an a you know first  chatbot that passes the touring test
00:47:20 right and it was this thing called eugene guzman that was supposed to simulate a 13 year
00:47:25 old boy and you know and apparently someone had done
00:47:30 some tests where you know people couldn't you know you know were less than perfect let's
00:47:35 say distinguishing it from a human and they said well if you look at touring's paper
00:47:40 and you look at you know the percentages that he that he talked about then you know it seemed like we're past that threshold
00:47:48 right and you know i had a sort of you know different way to look at it instead of the legalistic way
00:47:54 like let's just try the actual thing out and let's see what it can do with questions like you know is mount everest
00:48:01 bigger than a shoebox okay or just you know like the most obvious questions right and then and you
00:48:07 know and the answer is well it just kind of parries you because it doesn't know what you're talking
00:48:11 about right so just clarify exactly in which way they're obvious they're obvious
00:48:18 in the sense that you convert the sentences into the meaning of the objects they represent and then do some basic
00:48:26 obvious we mean your common sense reasoning with the objects that the sentences represent  right right it was not able
00:48:31 to answer you know or even intelligently respond to basic common sense questions but let
00:48:37 me say something stronger than that there was a famous chatbot in the 60s called eliza
00:48:43 right that you know that managed to actually fool you know a lot of people right or people
00:48:48 would pour their hearts out into this elisa because it simulated a therapist right and most of what it would do is it
00:48:55 would just throw back at you whatever you said right and this turned out to be
00:48:59 incredibly effective right maybe you know therapists know this this is you know one of their tricks
00:49:08 but  it um you know it it really had some people convinced  but you know this this thing was just
00:49:15 like i think it was literally just a few hundred lines of lisp code right it was not only was
00:49:20 it not intelligent it wasn't especially sophisticated it was like a it was a simple little hobbyist program
00:49:27 and eugene gusman from what i could see was not a significant advance compared to  eliza right so so this is and and
00:49:34 that was that was really the point i was making and this was
00:49:39 you know you didn't in some sense you didn't need a like a computer science professor to sort of
00:49:44 say this like anyone who was looking at it and who just had
00:49:49 you know an ounce of sense could have said the same thing right well but because you know these
00:49:54 journalists were call you know calling me you know like the first thing i said was
00:49:59  well you know no you know i i'm a quantum computing person i'm not an ai person you know you shouldn't ask me
00:50:05 then they said look you can go here and you can try it out i said all right all right so i'll try it out but now
00:50:10 you know this whole discussion i mean it got a whole lot more interesting in just the
00:50:15 last few months yeah i'd love to hear your thoughts about gpt yeah yeah yeah
00:50:21 in the last few months we've had you know we've we've the world has now seen a chat engine or
00:50:27 a text engine i should say called gpt-3 that you know i think it it's still you
00:50:33 know it does not pass a touring test you know there are no real claims that it passes the touring test
00:50:40 right you know this is comes out of the group at open ai and you know they're you know they've
00:50:45 been relatively careful and what they've claimed about the system but i think this this this
00:50:53  as clearly as eugene gusman was not in advance over eliza it is equally clear that this is a major
00:50:59 advance over over over eliza or really over anything that the world has seen before
00:51:07  this is a text engine that can come up with kind of on topic you know reasonable sounding completions to just
00:51:14 about anything that you ask you can ask it to write a poem about topic x in the style of poet y
00:51:23 and it will have a go at that yeah and it will do you know not a perf not a great job not an
00:51:27 amazing job but you know a passable job you know definitely you know as as good as you know
00:51:35 you know in in many cases i would say better than i would have done right  you know you can ask it to
00:51:39 write you know an essay like a student essay about pretty much any topic and it will get something
00:51:45 that i am pretty sure would get at least a b minus you know in my most you know
00:51:51 high school or even college classes right and you know in some sense you know the way that it did this the
00:51:56 way that it achieves this you know scott alexander of the you know the much
00:52:03 mourned blog slate star codex had a wonderful way of putting it he said that they basically just ground up the entire
00:52:10 internet into a slurry okay yeah and you know and i i to tell you the truth i had wondered for a while
00:52:16 why nobody had tried that right like why not write a chat bot by just doing deep learning over a corpus
00:52:24 consisting of the entire web right and and so so so  now they finally have done that
00:52:31 right and you know the results are are very impressive you know it's not clear that you know
00:52:37 people can argue about whether this is truly a step toward general ai or not but this is an
00:52:42 amazing capability  that you know  we didn't have a few years ago
00:52:49 that you know if a few years ago if you had told me that we would have it now that would have surprised me
00:52:55 yeah and i think that anyone who denies that is just not engaging with what's there so their model it takes a large part of
00:53:01 the internet and compresses it in a small number of parameters relative to the size of the internet and
00:53:09 is able to without fine-tuning  do a basic kind of a quarrying mechanism
00:53:16 just like you described where you specify a kind of poet and then you want to write a poem and somehow i
00:53:22 was able to do basically a lookup on the internet well of relevant things i mean that's what i mean i mean i mean
00:53:28 how else do you explain it well okay i mean i mean the the training involved you know massive amounts of
00:53:34 data from the internet and actually took lots and lots of computer power lots of electricity right you know there are some some very
00:53:41 prosaic reasons why this wasn't done earlier right right but you know it costs some tens of millions of dollars i think
00:53:47 you know that's just for approximately like a few million dollars oh okay okay oh really okay
00:53:54 you know oh all right all right thank you i mean as they as they scale it up you know it will
00:53:59 cost but then the hope is cost comes down and all that kind of stuff but basically you know it is a
00:54:07 neural net you know so i mean i mean or what's now called a deep net but you know they're basically the same thing
00:54:11 right so it's a it's a form of you know  algorithm that people
00:54:18 have known about for decades right  but it is constantly trying to solve the problem predict the next word right so it's just
00:54:27 trying to predict what comes next it's not trying to decide
00:54:33 what what it should say what ought to be true it's trying to predict what someone who had said all of the words
00:54:40 up to the preceding one would say next although to push back on that that's how it's trained
00:54:45 but that's right no but it's arguable arguable yeah that our very cognition could be a
00:54:50 mechanism as that simple of course of course i never said that it wasn't right but right
00:54:56 but yeah i mean i mean and sometimes that that is you know if there is a deep
00:55:00 philosophical question that's raised by gpt3 then that is it right are we doing anything other than
00:55:07 you know this predictive processing just trying to constantly trying to fill in a blank of
00:55:12 what would come next after what we just said up to this point is that what i'm doing right now
00:55:19 it's impossible so the intuition that a lot of people have will look this thing is not going to be able
00:55:24 to reason the mountain everest question do you think it's possible that gbt5 6 and 7 would be able to with this exact
00:55:33 same process begin to do something that looks like is indistinguishable to us humans from reasoning
00:55:41 i mean the truth is that we don't really know what the limits are right because exactly because you know
00:55:46 what we've seen so far is that you know gbt3 was basically the same thing as gpt-2
00:55:54 but just with you know a much larger   network you know more training time bigger training corpus right and it was
00:56:03 you know very noticeably better right than its immediate predecessor so  we you know we don't know where
00:56:09 you hit the ceiling here right i mean that's the that's the amazing part and maybe also
00:56:13 the scary part right that  you know now my guess would be that that you know at some point
00:56:20 like there has to be diminishing returns like it can't be that simple can it right right but i i i i wish that
00:56:27 i had more to base that guess on right yeah i mean some people say that there will be a limitation on the
00:56:33 we're going to hit a limit on the amount of data that's on the internet yes yeah yeah so sure so so there's
00:56:38 certainly that limit i mean there's also you know like if you are looking for questions that will
00:56:46 stump gpt3 right you can come up with some without you know like you know even getting it to learn
00:56:52 how to balance parentheses right like it can you know it doesn't do such a great job
00:56:58 right  you know like like you know and you know and its failures are are are ironic right
00:57:03 like like basic arithmetic right and you think you know isn't that what computers are supposed to be best at
00:57:09 yeah isn't that where computers already had us beat a century ago yeah right and yeah and yet that's where gpt-3
00:57:15 struggles right but it's it's amazing you know that it's almost like a young child in that way
00:57:22 right that   but but  somehow you know because it is just trying to predict
00:57:29 what what  comes next it doesn't know when it should stop doing that and start doing something
00:57:33 very different like some more exact logical reasoning right and so so you know the   you know you one
00:57:42 one is naturally led to guess that our brain sort of has some element of predictive processing
00:57:48 but that it's coupled to other mechanisms right that it's coupled to you know first of all visual reasoning
00:57:54 which gpt3 also doesn't have any of right although there's some demonstration that there's a lot of
00:57:58 promise there oh yeah it can complete images that's right and using the exact same kind of
00:58:04 transformer mechanisms to like watch videos on youtube and  so the same  the same
00:58:10 self-supervised mechanism to be able to look it'd be fascinating to think what kind of completions you could do oh yeah
00:58:15 no absolutely although like if we ask it to like you know a word problem that involve
00:58:21 reasoning about the locations of things in space i don't think it does such a great job on those
00:58:27 right to take an example and so so the guess would be well you know humans have a lot of
00:58:31 predictive processing a lot of just filling in the blanks but we also have these other mechanisms that we can
00:58:37 couple to or that we can sort of call the subroutines when we need to and that maybe maybe you know  to go
00:58:43 further that one would one would want to integrate other forms of reasoning let me go on another topic that is amazing
00:58:53  which is complexity  what  and then start with the most absurdly romantic question of what's the
00:59:00 most beautiful idea in computer science or theoretical computer science to you like what just
00:59:06 early on in your life or in general i've captivated you and just grabbed you i think i'm gonna have to go with the
00:59:12 idea of universality  you know if you're really asking for the most beautiful
00:59:18 i mean  so universality  is the idea that you know you put together a few
00:59:25 simple operations like in the case of boolean logic that might be the and gate the or gate the not gate right and then
00:59:31 your first guess is okay this is a good start but obviously as i want to do more complicated things
00:59:38 i'm going to need more complicated building blocks to express that right and and that was actually my guess
00:59:44 when i first learned what programming was i mean when i was you know an adolescent and i someone showed me
00:59:51   apple basic and then you know  gw basic if any any anyone listening remembers that
00:59:58 okay but  you know i thought okay well now you know i mean i i thought i felt like this is a
01:00:04 revelation you know it's like finding out where babies come from it's like that level of you know why didn't
01:00:09 anyone tell me this before right but i thought okay this is just the beginning now i know how to write a
01:00:14 basic program but to you know really write a an interesting program like a you know a
01:00:20 video game which had always been my my dream as a kid to you know create my own nintendo games right that
01:00:25 you know but you know obviously i'm going to need to learn some way more complicated form of
01:00:31 programming than that okay but you know eventually i learned this incredible idea of universality
01:00:39 and that says that no you throw in a few rules and then you can you already have enough to express
01:00:46 everything okay so for example the and the or and the not gate  can all or in fact even just the
01:00:51 and in the not gate or even just even just the nand gate for example
01:00:57  is already enough to express any boolean function on any number of bits you just have to
01:01:01 string together enough of them because you can build a universe with nand gates you can build the universe out of nand
01:01:05 gates yeah  you know the the simple instructions of basic
01:01:12 are already enough at least in principle you know if we ignore details like how much memory can be accessed and stuff
01:01:17 like that that is enough to express what could be expressed by any programming language whatsoever
01:01:25 and the way to prove that is very simple we simply need to show that in basic or whatever we could write
01:01:31 an interpreter or a compiler for whatever is other programming language we care about
01:01:36 like c or or java or whatever and as soon as we had done that then ipso facto
01:01:43 anything that's expressible in c or java is also expressible and basic okay and so this idea of universality
01:01:51 you know goes back at least to alan turing in the 1930s when you know he   wrote down
01:01:58 this incredibly simple pared down model of a computer the touring machine
01:02:04 right which  you know he pared down the instruction set to just read a symbol you know go to
01:02:12 write a symbol move to the left move to the right  halt change your internal state right
01:02:16 that's it okay and anybody proved that you know this could simulate all kinds
01:02:23 of other things  you know and so so in fact today we would say
01:02:28 well we would call it a touring universal model of computation that is you know just as it has just the
01:02:35 same expressive power that basic or  java or c plus plus or any of those other
01:02:41 languages have  because anything in those other languages could be compiled down
01:02:48 to touring machine now touring also proved a different related thing which is that there is a single touring machine
01:02:56  that can simulate any other touring machine if you   just describe that other machine on its tape
01:03:03 right and likewise there is a single touring machine that will run any c program you know if
01:03:08 you just put it on its tape that's that that's a second meaning of universality first of all that he couldn't visualize
01:03:14 it and that was in the 30s 30s that's right before computers really i mean i don't know how i wonder
01:03:25 what that felt like  you know learning that there's no santa claus or something   because i i don't know if that's
01:03:32 empowering or paralyzing because it it doesn't  give you any ins it's 
01:03:37 like you can't write a software engineering book and make that the first chapter and say we're done
01:03:43 well i mean i mean right i mean i mean in one sense it was this enormous flattening of the universe
01:03:48 yes right i had imagined that there was going to be some infinite hierarchy of more and more powerful programming languages
01:03:56 you know and then i kicked myself for you know for having such a stupid idea but apparently girdle had had the same
01:04:01 conjecture in the 30s and then you know you're in good company well yeah and then and then and then tori
01:04:08 and then girdle read toring's paper and he kicked himself and he said yeah i was completely wrong about that
01:04:13 okay but but you know i had thought that you know maybe maybe where i can contribute will
01:04:18 be to invent a new more powerful programming language that lets you express things that could
01:04:23 never be expressed in basic yeah right and you know and then you know how would you do that obviously you
01:04:28 couldn't do it itself in basic right but   but you know there is this incredible
01:04:33 flattening that happens once you learn what is universality but then it's also  like
01:04:41 an opportunity because it means once you know these rules then you know the sky is the limit right
01:04:47 then you have kind of the same weapons at your disposal that the world's greatest programmer has
01:04:53 it's now all just a question of how you wield them right exactly but so every problem is
01:04:59 solvable but some problems are harder than others and well yeah there's the question of
01:05:04 how much time you know well of how hard is it to write a program and then there's also the
01:05:08 questions of what resources does the program need you know how much time how much memory
01:05:14 those are much more complicated questions of course ones that we're still struggling with today
01:05:19 exactly so you've  i don't know if you created complexity zoo or i did create the complexity zoo what is
01:05:24 it what's complexity oh all right all right complexity theory is the study of
01:05:31 sort of the inherent resources needed to solve  computational problems okay so   it's easiest to give an example  like
01:05:42  let's say we want to um add two two numbers right if i want to add them  you know if the numbers are twice as
01:05:48 long then it only it will take me twice as long to add them but only twice as long
01:05:55 right it's no worse than that for a computer or or for a person we're using pencil and
01:05:59 paper for that matter if you have a good algorithm yeah that's right i mean even if you just if you just use the elementary school
01:06:06 algorithm of just carrying you know then it it takes time that is linear in the length of the numbers
01:06:12 right now multiplication if you use the elementary school algorithm is harder because you have to multiply
01:06:19 each digit of the first number by each digit of the second one yeah and then deal with all the carries
01:06:25 so that's what we call a quadratic time algorithm right if the numbers become twice as long now you need four times as
01:06:31 much time okay so now as it turns out we  people discovered much faster ways to
01:06:41 multiply numbers using computers and today we know how to multiply two numbers that are n digits long
01:06:48 using a number of steps that's nearly linear in n these are questions you can ask but now
01:06:53 let's think about a different thing that people  you know they've encountered in elementary school  factoring a number
01:07:01 okay take a number and find its prime factors right and here you know if i give you a number with 10 digits
01:07:08 i ask you for its prime factors well maybe it's even so you know that two is a factor
01:07:13 you know maybe it ends in zero so you know that ten is a factor right but you know other than a few obvious things
01:07:19 like that you know if the prime factors are all very large then it's not clear how you even get started
01:07:26 right you know you it seems like you have to do an exhaustive search among an enormous number of factors now
01:07:34 and and as many people might know  the  for for for better or worse the  security you know of most of the
01:07:42 encryption that we currently use to protect the internet is based on the belief and this is not a theorem
01:07:49 it's a belief that  that factoring is an inherently hard problem  for our computers we do know
01:07:56 algorithms that are better than just trial division and just trying all the possible divisors  but they are still
01:08:04 basically exponential exponential is hard yeah exactly so this so the the fastest algorithms that anyone has discovered
01:08:12 at least publicly discovered you know i'm assuming that the nsa doesn't know something better
01:08:17 yeah okay but they they take time that basically grows exponentially with the cube root of the
01:08:23 size of the number that you're factoring right so that cube root that's the part that takes all the cleverness okay but
01:08:29 there's still an exponential there's still an exponentiality there but what that means is that like
01:08:36 when people use a thousand bit keys for their cryptography that can probably be broken using the
01:08:41 resources of the nsa or the world's other intelligence agencies you know people have done
01:08:46 analyses that say you know with a few hundred million dollars of computer power they could
01:08:50 totally do this and if you look at the documents that snowden released
01:08:56 you know it it it look it looks a lot like they are doing that or something like that
01:09:00 it would kind of be surprising if they weren't okay but you know if that's true then in in some
01:09:06 ways that's reassuring because if that's the best that they can do then that would say that they can't
01:09:11 break two thousand bit numbers right exactly exactly right then two thousand bit numbers would be
01:09:17 would be beyond what even they could do they haven't found an efficient algorithm that's where
01:09:21 all the worries and the concerns of quantum computing came in that there's some kind of shortcut around that right
01:09:26 so complexity theory is a you know is is a huge part of let's say the theoretical core of computer science
01:09:35 you know it it started in the 60s and 70s as you know sort of a you know autonomous field so it was
01:09:41 you know already you know i mean you know it was well developed even by the time that i
01:09:46 was born okay but   i in 2002 i made a website called the complexities zoo
01:09:55  to answer your question  where i just tried to catalog the different complexity classes which
01:10:01 are classes of problems that are solvable with different kinds of resources right okay so these are kind of you
01:10:08 know you could think of complexity classes as like being almost to to to theoretical computer science like what
01:10:15 the elements are to chemistry right they're sort of you know there are our most basic
01:10:21 objects in in a certain way i feel like the elements have  have a characteristic to them
01:10:27 where you can't just add an infinite number well you could but beyond a certain point they become unstable
01:10:35 right right so it's like you know in theory you can have atoms with yeah and look look i mean i mean i mean
01:10:41 a neutron star you know is a nucleus with you know uncalled billions of of of of nuke of
01:10:49 of  of of of of neutrons in it of of hadrons in it okay but  you know for for sort of normal
01:10:56 atoms right probably you can't get much above 100 you know atomic weight 150 or so
01:11:03 or sorry sorry i mean i mean beyond 150 or so protons without it you know very quickly fissioning  with
01:11:09 complexity classes well yeah you you can have an infinity of complexity classes  but you know maybe
01:11:15 there's only a finite number of them that are particularly interesting right just like with anything else you
01:11:20 know you   you care about some more than about others so what kind of interesting
01:11:25 classes are there yeah i mean you could have just maybe say what are the
01:11:30 if you you take any kind of computer science class what are the classes you learn good let me let me tell you sort of the
01:11:37 the the biggest ones the ones that you would learn first so you know first of all there is
01:11:42 that's what it's called okay it stands for polynomial time and this is just the class of all of the problems
01:11:50 that you could solve with a conventional computer like your iphone or your laptop  you know by a completely deterministic
01:11:59 algorithm right using a number of steps that grows only like the size of the input raised to some fixed power okay so
01:12:09  if your algorithm is linear time like you know for adding numbers okay that that problem is in p if you
01:12:16 have an algorithm that's quadratic time like the  elementary school algorithm for multiplying two numbers that's also
01:12:21 in p even if it was the size of the input to the 10th power
01:12:26 or to the 50th power well that wouldn't be very  good in practice but you know formally
01:12:31 we would still count that that would still be in p okay but if your algorithm takes
01:12:36 exponential time meaning like if every time i add one more  data point to your input if the
01:12:46 time that needed by the algorithm doubles if you need time like 2 to the power of the amount of input data
01:12:53 then  that is that we call an exponential time algorithm okay and that is not polynomial okay so
01:13:02 is all of the problems that have some polynomial time algorithm okay so that includes most of what we do
01:13:09 with our computers on a day-to-day basis you know all the you know sorting basic arithmetic
01:13:14 you know whatever is going on in your email reader or in angry birds okay it's all in p then the next 
01:13:21 super important class is called np  that stands for non-deterministic polynomial
01:13:29 okay does not stand for not polynomial which is a common confusion but np was basically
01:13:35 all of the problems where if there is a solution then it is easy to check the solution
01:13:42 if someone shows it to you okay so actually a perfect example of a problem in np is 
01:13:48 factoring the one i told you about before like if i gave you a number with thousands of
01:13:54 digits and i told you that you know i i asked you does this  does this have at least three
01:14:02 non-trivial divisors right that might be a super hard problem to solve right might take you millions
01:14:07 of years using any algorithm that's known at least running on our existing computers
01:14:14 okay but if i simply showed you the divisors i said here are three divisors of this number then it would be very easy for you to
01:14:22 ask your computer to just check each one and see if it works just divide it in
01:14:27 see if there's any remainder right and if they all go in then you've checked well i guess there
01:14:32 were right so so any problem where you know wherever there's a
01:14:39 solution there is a short witness that can be easily like a polynomial size witness that can be checked in
01:14:45 polynomial time that we call an np problem okay beautiful and  yeah so so every problem that's
01:14:52 in p is also in np right because you know you could always just
01:14:57 ignore the witness and just you know if a problem is in p you can just solve it yourself right okay but now the influence is the central
01:15:06 you know mystery of theoretical computer science is is every np problem in p so if you can easily check the answer to a
01:15:15 a computational problem does that mean that you can also easily find the answer even though there's all these problems
01:15:21 that appear to be very difficult to find the answer it's still an open question whether
01:15:27 a good answer exists so what's yours no one has proven that there's no way to do it it's
01:15:33 arguably the most  i don't know the most famous the most maybe interesting maybe disagree with that
01:15:39 problem in theoretical computer science so what's your most famous for sure p equals np yeah if you were to bet all
01:15:44 your money where do you put your money that's an easy one p is not equal to np okay so i
01:15:49 like to say that if we were physicists we would have just declared that to be a law of nature
01:15:53 you know just like just like thermodynamics it's hilarious giving ourselves nobel prizes for its
01:15:59 discovery yeah you know and look if later if later it turned out that we were wrong we just give ourselves
01:16:11 i mean no i mean i mean i mean it's it's really just because we are mathematicians or descended from
01:16:16 mathematicians you know we have to call things conjectures that other people would just call empirical
01:16:22 facts or discoveries right but one shouldn't read more into the difference in in language
01:16:29 you know about the underlying truth so okay so you're a good investor and good spender money so then let me
01:16:34 i don't know that let me ask another way is it possible at all and what would that look like if p
01:16:42 indeed equals np well i do think that it's possible i mean in fact you know when people really pressed me on my blog
01:16:47 for what odds would i put like well you know two or three percent odds wow that's pretty good that p
01:16:54 equals np yeah just speak well because you know when p i mean i mean you you really have to
01:16:59 think about like if there were 50 you know mysteries like p versus np and if i made a guess about every single
01:17:05 one of them would i expect to be right 50 times right and the truthful answer is no
01:17:13 okay yeah so you know and and and and and that's what you really mean in saying that you know you have
01:17:18 you know better than 98 odds for something okay but so so yeah you know i mean there could certainly be surprises and
01:17:25 look if p equals np well then there would be the further question
01:17:30 of you know is the algorithm actually efficient in practice right i mean don knuth who i know that
01:17:36 you you've interviewed as well right he  likes to conjecture that p equals np but that the algorithm is so
01:17:44 inefficient that it doesn't matter anyway right now i i don't know i've listened to him say that i don't know
01:17:50 whether he says that just because he has an actual reason for thinking it's true or just because it sounds cool
01:17:57 yeah okay but but you know that that's a logical possibility right that the algorithm could be
01:18:03 n to the 10 000 time or it could even just be n squared time but with a leading constant
01:18:08 of a it could be a google times n squared or something like that and in that case the fact that p equals np
01:18:15 well it would it would  you know ravage the whole theory of  complexity we would have to you
01:18:20 know rebuild from the ground up but in practical terms it might mean very little right
01:18:26 if the algorithm was too inefficient to run if the algorithm could actually be run in practice like
01:18:33 if if it had small enough constants you know to or if you could improve it to where it had
01:18:39 small enough constants that it was  efficient in practice then that would change the world okay
01:18:43 you think it would have like what kind of impact well okay i mean i mean here's an
01:18:48 example i mean you could well okay just for starters you could break basically all of the encryption that
01:18:54 people use to protect the internet first you could you could break bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency or you know
01:19:00  mine as much bitcoin as you wanted right  you know become a you know become a a super duper billionaire right and then
01:19:09 and then plot your next move right okay that's just for starters right right now your next move might be
01:19:14 something like you know you now have like a theoretically optimal way
01:19:20 to train any neural network to find parameters for any neural network right so you could now say like is there any
01:19:26 small neural network that generates the entire content of wikipedia right if you know and now the question
01:19:33 is not can you find it the question has been reduced to does that exist or not yes
01:19:38 if it does exist then the answer would be yes you can find it okay if if if you had this algorithm in
01:19:43 your hands okay you could ask your computer you know i mean i mean
01:19:49 p versus np is one of these seven problems that carries this million dollar prize from the clay foundation
01:19:55 you know if you solve it  you know and others are the riemann hypothesis  the punk array conjecture which was
01:20:02 solved although the solver turned down the price right and  and and four others but
01:20:06 what i like to say the way that we can see that p versus np is the biggest of all of these questions
01:20:13 is that if you had this fast algorithm then you could solve all seven of them okay you just ask your computer you know
01:20:19 is there a short proof of the riemann hypothesis right you know that a machine could in a language where a machine could verify it
01:20:27 and provided that such a proof exists then your computer finds it in a short amount of time without having
01:20:32 to do a brute force search okay so i mean i mean those are the stakes of what we're talking about
01:20:38 but i hope that also helps to give your listeners some intuition of why i and most of my colleagues would
01:20:46 put our money on p not equaling np is it possible i apologize this is a really dumb question but is it possible to
01:20:53 that proof will come out that p equals np but an algorithm that makes p equals np is impossible to find
01:21:03 is that like crazy okay well well if p equals np it would mean that there is such an
01:21:09 algorithm that it exists yeah but um you know it would it would mean that it exists
01:21:16 now you know in practice normally the way that we would prove anything like that would be
01:21:20 by finding the algorithm by finding that one algorithm but there is such a thing as a
01:21:24 non-constructive proof that an algorithm exists you know this is really only reared its head i think a
01:21:29 few times in the history of our field right but you know it is
01:21:36 it is theoretically possible that that that that such a thing could happen but you know there are so even here there are
01:21:42 some amusing observations that one could make so there is this famous observation of leonid levin
01:21:48 who is you know one of the original discoverers of np completeness right and he said
01:21:54 well consider the following algorithm that like i i guarantee we'll solve the np problems efficiently
01:22:00 just as provided that p equals np okay here is what it does it just runs you know it enumerates every
01:22:07 possible algorithm in a gigantic infinite list yeah right from like in like alphabetical order right
01:22:15 you know and many of them maybe won't even compile so we just ignore those okay but now
01:22:20 we just you know run the first algorithm then we run the second algorithm we run the first one a little bit
01:22:25 more then we run the first three algorithms for a while we won the first four for a while
01:22:30 this is called dovetailing by the way this is a known trick in  theoretical computer science
01:22:36 okay but we do it in such a way that you know whatever is the algorithm
01:22:43 out there in in in our list that solves np-complete you know the np problems efficiently will eventually hit that one
01:22:50 right and now the key is that whenever we hit that one you know it you know by assumption it
01:22:56 has to solve the problem that's to find the solution and once it claims to find a solution
01:23:01 then we can check that ourself right because these are increasing problems then we can check it
01:23:07 now this is utterly impractical all right you know you'd have to do this enormous exhaustive search among all the algorithms
01:23:14 but from a certain theoretical standpoint that is merely a constant prefactor that's merely a multiplier of your
01:23:22 running time so there are tricks like that one can do to say that in some sense the algorithm would have
01:23:27 to be  constructive but you know in in in the human sense you know it is possible that
01:23:34 you know it's conceivable that one could prove such a thing  via a non-constructive method is is that
01:23:40 likely i don't think so first no no no not personally so that's p and and p but the complexities it was full of
01:23:47 wonderful creatures well it's got about 500 of them 500. so how do you get  yeah
01:23:54 yeah how do you get more how do you yeah well yeah well okay i mean i mean i mean just for starters there is
01:24:00 everything that we could do with a conventional computer with a polynomial amount of memory
01:24:07 okay but possibly an exponential amount of time because we get to reuse the same memory over and over again
01:24:14 okay that is called p space okay and that's actually a  we think an even larger class than np
01:24:22 okay well p is contained in np which is contained in p space and we think that those containments are
01:24:27 strict and the constraint there is on the memory the memory has to grow
01:24:32 polynomially with the size of the product that's right that's right but in p space
01:24:37 we now have interesting things that were not in in np like  as a famous example you know
01:24:42 from a given position in chess you know does white or black have the win
01:24:48 let's say assuming provided that the game lasts only for a a reasonable number of moves okay or or
01:24:54 or likewise for go okay and you know even for the generalizations of these games to arbitrary
01:24:59 size boards because with an eight by eight board you could say that's just a constant size problem you just
01:25:05 you know in principle you just solve it in o of one time right but so we really mean the  the
01:25:10 generalizations of you know games to  arbitrary size boards here
01:25:17 or another thing in p space would be  like i give you some really hard constraint satisfaction problem
01:25:25 like you know a you know traveling person or you know packing boxes into the trunk of your car or something like that
01:25:32 and i asked not just is there a solution which would be an np problem but i ask how many solutions are there okay
01:25:40 that you know count the number of of solu of valid solutions that that that actually gives those
01:25:46 problems lie in a complexity class called sharp p or like it looks like hashtag like hashtag p you got it okay which
01:25:53 sits between np and p space there's all the problems that you can do in exponential time
01:26:03 okay that's called x so and by the way  it it was proven in the 60s
01:26:10 that x is larger than p okay so we know that much we know that there are problems that are
01:26:15 solvable in exponential time that are not solvable in polynomial time okay in fact we even know more we know that
01:26:22 there are problems that are solvable in n cube time that are not solvable in n squared time
01:26:28 and that those don't help us with a controversy between p and m unfortunately it seems not or certainly
01:26:33 not yet right the the the techniques that we use to establish those things
01:26:39 they're very very related to how touring proved the unsolvability of the halting problem but they seem to break down when we're
01:26:45 comparing two different resources like time versus space or like you know p versus np okay but
01:26:53 you know i mean there's there's what you can do with a randomized algorithm right that can sometimes you know with
01:26:59 some has some probability of making a mistake that's called bpp bounded our probabilistic polynomial time
01:27:07 and then of course there's one that's very close to my own heart what you can efficiently do during
01:27:12 polynomial time using a quantum computer okay and that's called bqp
01:27:19 right and so you know what's understood about that class okay so p is contained in bpp
01:27:25 which is contained in bqp which is contained in p space okay so anything you can in fact
01:27:30 in in like in something very similar to sharp p bqp is basically
01:27:37 you know well it's contained in like p with the magic power to solve sharp p problems okay why why is bqp
01:27:45 contained in  p space oh that's an excellent question  so  there there is um
01:27:51 well i mean one one has to prove that okay but  the proof  you could you could
01:27:56 think of it as  using  richard feynman's picture of quantum mechanics
01:28:02 which is that you can always you know we haven't really talked about  quantum mechanics in this in this
01:28:08 conversation we we did in our previous yeah yeah we did last time but yeah we did last time okay but 
01:28:13  but basically you could always think of a quantum computation as  like a branching tree of possibilities
01:28:22 where each pos each possible path that you could take through you know your the space has a
01:28:27 complex number attached to it called an amplitude okay and now the rule is you know when you make a
01:28:34 measurement at the end well you see a random answer okay but quantum mechanics is all about
01:28:40 calculating the probability that you're going to see one potential answer versus another one
01:28:47 right and the rule for calculating the probability that you'll see some answer is that you have to add up the
01:28:53 amplitudes for all of the paths that could have led to that answer and then you know that's a complex
01:28:59 number so that you know how could that be a probability then you take the squared absolute value of the result
01:29:06 that gives you a number between zero and one okay so yeah i just i just summarized
01:29:11 quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds okay but  but now you know what what this already tells us is that anything i can
01:29:19 do with a quantum computer i could simulate with a classical computer if i
01:29:25 only have exponentially more time okay and why is that because if i have exponential time
01:29:31 i could just write down this entire branching tree and just explicitly calculate each of
01:29:35 these amplitudes right you know that will be very inefficient but it will work
01:29:41 right it's enough to show that quantum computers could not solve the halting problem or you know
01:29:47 they could never do anything that is literally uncomputable in touring sense okay but now as i said there is even a stronger
01:29:55 result which says that bqp is contained in p space the way that we prove that
01:30:02 is that we say if if all i want is to calculate the probability of some particular output happening
01:30:08 we know which is all i need to simulate a quantum computer really then i don't need to write down the
01:30:13 entire quantum state which is an exponentially large object all i need to do
01:30:20 is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final state and to do that i just have to sum up
01:30:27 all the amplitudes that lead to that state okay so that's an exponentially large sum
01:30:33 but i can calculate it just reusing the same memory over and over for each term in the song hence the p in
01:30:38 the pieces yeah yeah so what  out of that whole complexity zoo and it
01:30:45 could be bqp what do you find is the most   the class that captured your heart
01:30:50 the most is the most beautiful class there's just yeah i i used  as my email address 
01:31:00 bqpqpali gmail.com yes because  bqp slash q poly well you know amazingly no one had taken
01:31:07 it amazing but you know but th this is a class that i was involved in sort of 
01:31:13 defining proving the first theorems about  in 2003 or so so it was kind of close to my heart but
01:31:20 this is like if we extended bqp which is the class of everything we can do efficiently with a quantum computer
01:31:29  to allow quantum advice which means imagine that you had some special initial state
01:31:35 okay that could somehow help you do computation and maybe such a state would be exponentially
01:31:41 hard to prepare okay but you know maybe somehow these states were formed in the big bang or
01:31:47 something and they've just been sitting around ever since right if you found one and if this state could be like ultra power
01:31:55 there are no limits on how powerful it could be except that this state doesn't know in
01:31:59 advance which input you've got right it only knows the size of your input
01:32:05 you know and then that that's bqp slash q probably so that's that's one that i just
01:32:09 personally happen to love okay but you know if you're asking like what's the
01:32:14 you know there's there's there's a class that i think is is is way more beautiful than you know or fundamental
01:32:22 that a lot of people even within  this this field realize that it is that class is called sck or statistical
01:32:28 zero knowledge and you know there's a very very easy way to define this class which is to say
01:32:37 suppose that i have two algorithms that each sample from probability distributions right so each one just outputs random samples
01:32:45 according to you know possibly different distributions and now the question i ask is you know you know let's say distributions over
01:32:52 strings of n bits yeah so over an exponentially large space now i ask
01:32:59 are these two distributions close or far as probability distributions okay any problem that can be reduced to that
01:33:06 you know that can be put into that form is an sdk problem and the way that this class was
01:33:12 originally discovered was completely different from that and was kind of more complicated it was
01:33:18 discovered as the class of all of the problems that have a certain kind of what's called zero knowledge proof
01:33:24 zero knowledge proofs are one of the central ideas in cryptography you know shafi goldwasser and silvio
01:33:31 mccauley won the touring award for you know inventing them and they're at the core of even some some
01:33:37 cryptocurrencies that you know people people use nowadays but there are zero knowledge proofs or
01:33:45 ways of proving to someone that something is true like you know that there is a a solution
01:33:50 to this you know  optimization problem or that these two graphs are
01:33:57 isomorphic to each other or something but without revealing why it's true without revealing anything about why
01:34:02 it's true okay sdk is all of the problems for which there is such a proof  that
01:34:10 doesn't rely on any cryptography okay and if if you wonder like how could such a thing possibly exist
01:34:18 right well like imagine that i had two graphs and i wanted to convince you that these two graphs are not
01:34:25 isomorphic meaning you know i cannot permute one of them so that it's the same as the other one
01:34:30 right you know that might be a very hard statement to prove like i might you know you might have to do a very
01:34:35 exhaustive enumeration of you know all the different permutations before you were convinced
01:34:40 that it was true but what if there were some all-knowing wizard that said to you look i'll tell you what
01:34:47 just pick one of the graphs randomly then randomly permute it then send it to me and i will tell you
01:34:54 which graph you started with okay and i will do that every single time and let's say that that wizard did that
01:35:04 a hundred times and it was right every time yeah right now if the graphs were isomorphic then
01:35:09 you know it would have been flipping a coin each time right it would have had only a one in
01:35:13 two to the 100 power chance of you know of guessing right each time
01:35:19 but you know so so if it's right every time then now you're statistically convinced that these graphs are not isomorphic
01:35:25 even though you've learned nothing new about why they aren't so fascinating so yeah so so
01:35:31 sdk is all of the problems that have protocols like that one but it has this beautiful other
01:35:37 characterization it's shown up again and again in my in my own work in you know a lot of people's work
01:35:43 and i think that it really is one of the most fundamental classes it's just that people didn't realize
01:35:48 that when it was first discovered so we're living in the middle of a pandemic currently yeah how has
01:35:55 your life been changed or no better to ask like how is your perspective of the world change
01:36:01 with this  world-changing event of a pandemic overtaking the entire world yeah well i mean i mean all of our lives
01:36:07 have changed you know like i guess as with no other event since i was born you know you would have to go
01:36:13 back to world war ii for something i think of this magnitude you know 
01:36:18 on you know the way that we live our lives as for how it has changed my world view i think that the the failure of institutions
01:36:29 you know like  like like the cdc like you know other institutions that we sort of thought were were
01:36:36 trustworthy like a lot of the media  was  staggering was was absolutely breathtaking  it is something that i would not have
01:36:44 predicted right i think i i  wrote on my blog   that you know you know it it's it's abs it's
01:36:51 fascinating to like re-watch the movie  contagion from a decade ago right that correctly foresaw
01:36:58 so many aspects of you know what was going on you know a  an airborne you know virus
01:37:04 originates in China  spreads to you know much of the world you know shuts everything down
01:37:11 until a vaccine can be developed  you know everyone has to stay at home you know you know it gets  you know an
01:37:17 enormous number of things right okay but the one thing that they could not imagine you know is that like
01:37:23 in this movie everyone from the government is like hyper comp competent hyper you know
01:37:28 dedicated to the public good right best of the best you know yeah the they're the best of the best
01:37:33 you know they could you know and there are these conspiracy theorists right who  think you know you know
01:37:40 this is all fake news there's no there's not really a pandemic and those are some random people on the
01:37:45 internet who the hyper competent government people have to you know oppose right
01:37:50 they you know in in trying to envision the worst thing that could happen like you know the the there was a
01:37:57 failure of imagination the movie makers did not imagine that the conspiracy theorists and the
01:38:01 you know and the incompetence and the nut cases would have captured
01:38:06 our institutions and be the ones actually running things so you had a certain yeah i i love competence
01:38:13 in all walks of life i love i get so much energy i'm so excited but people do amazing job and i like you
01:38:20  well maybe you can clarify but i had maybe not an intuition but i hope that government at his best could be ultra com
01:38:28 competent what  first of all two questions like how do you explain the lack of confidence
01:38:33 and the other maybe on the positive side how can we build a more competent government well there's an election in two months i
01:38:40 mean you know you have a faith that the election i  you know it's not gonna fix
01:38:46 everything but you know it's like i feel like there is a ship that is sinking and you could at least stop the sinking
01:38:52 but   you know i think that there are there are much much deeper problems i mean i think that
01:38:58  you know it is it is plausible to me that you know a lot of the the failures you know with the cdc
01:39:05 with  some of the other health agencies even you know you know pre-date trump you know
01:39:10 pre-date the you know right-wing populism that has sort of taken over much of the world now and
01:39:18 you know i think that   you know it was is you know it is very i'm actually
01:39:24 you know i've actually been strongly in favor of you know rushing vaccines of  
01:39:30 you know i thought that we could have done you know human human challenge trials you know which
01:39:35 were not done right we could have you know like i had you know volunteers
01:39:42 you know to   actually you know be you know  get vaccines get you know exposed to covid so you know
01:39:48 innovative ways of accelerating what you've done previously over a long time i thought that you know each each
01:39:54 month that you that that a vaccine is is closer is like trillions of dollars are used for civilization
01:40:00 and of course lives you know at least you know hundreds of thousands of lives are you surprised that it's taking this
01:40:06 long we still don't have a plan there's still not a feeling like anyone is actually doing anything in terms of 
01:40:13 elite alleviating like any kind of plan so there's a bunch of stuff this vaccine but you could also do
01:40:18 a testing infrastructure where yeah everybody's tested non-stop with contact tracing all that kind of well i mean i
01:40:24 i'm as surprised as almost everyone else i mean this is a historic failure it is one of the
01:40:31 biggest failures in the 240 year history of the united states right and we should be you know crystal
01:40:36 clear about that and you know one thing that i think has been missing you know even
01:40:42 even from the more competent side is like you know is sort of the the world war ii mentality right the
01:40:51 you know the mentality of you know let's just you know you know if if if we can by breaking a whole bunch of rules
01:40:59 you know get a vaccine and you know and even half the amount of time as we thought then let's just do that
01:41:06 because  you know you know like like we have to we have to weigh all of the moral qualms that we have
01:41:11 about doing that against the moral qualms of not doing and one key
01:41:16 little aspect yeah that's deeply important to me and going that topic next is  the world war ii mentality
01:41:22 wasn't just about you know breaking all the rules to get the job done there was a togetherness to it
01:41:29 there's yes so i would if i were president right now it seems quite elementary to unite the country because we're
01:41:37 facing a crisis it's easy to make the virus the enemy and it's very surprising to me
01:41:45 that the div the division has increased as opposed to decreasing yeah so that that's that's heartbreaking yeah
01:41:50 well look i mean it's been said by others that this is the first time in the country's history that we have a
01:41:56 president who does not even pretend to you know what want to unite the country right
01:42:01 yeah and you know i mean i mean i mean lincoln who fought a civil war you know you know said he wanted to
01:42:06 unite the country right  you know and and and i i do i do worry enormously about what happens
01:42:15 if the results of this election are contested you know and you know will there be violence as a
01:42:19 result of that and will we have a clear path of succession and you know look i mean you know this
01:42:26 is all we're going to find out the answers to this in two months and if none of that happens
01:42:31 maybe i'll look foolish but i am willing to go on the record and say i am terrified about that yeah i've been
01:42:37 reading the the rise and fall of the third reich this is it so if i can this this is like one
01:42:43 little voice to put out there that i think november will be a really critical month
01:42:51 for people to breathe and put love out there do not you know anger in those in that context no matter
01:42:59 who wins no matter what is said will destroy our country may destroy our country it may destroy the world because
01:43:05 of the power of the country so it's really important to be patient loving empathetic
01:43:11 like one of the things that troubles me is that even people on the left are unable to have a love and respect
01:43:18 for people who voted for trump they can't imagine that there's good people that could vote
01:43:23 for the opposite side and that's oh i know there are because i know some of them yeah right i mean you know it's still
01:43:29 you know maybe it baffles me but you know i i know such people let me ask you this it's also
01:43:35 heartbreaking to me on the topic of cancer culture yeah so in the machine learning community i've
01:43:39 seen it a little bit that there's aggressive attacking of people who are trying to
01:43:48 have a nuanced conversation about things and it's troubling because it feels like nuanced conversation is the only way to
01:43:56 talk about difficult topics and when there's a thought police and speech police
01:44:02 on any nuanced conversation that everybody has to like in animal farm chant that racism is bad and
01:44:09 sexism is bad which is things that everybody believes and they're they can't possibly say anything nuance
01:44:16 it feels like it goes against any kind of progress from my kind of shallow perspective but
01:44:21 you've written a little bit about cancer culture did you have thoughts that are well
01:44:26 i mean i mean i mean to say that i am opposed to you know the this trend of of
01:44:33 cancellations or of you know shouting people down rather than engaging them that would be a
01:44:37 massive understatement right and i feel like you know i have put my money where my mouth is you know
01:44:43 not as much as some people have but you know i i've tried to do something i mean i have
01:44:50 defended you know  some unpopular people and unpopular you know ideas on my blog i've you know tried to defend you know
01:44:58 norms of  of  of of open discourse of you know reasoning with our opponents even when
01:45:05 i've been shouted down for that on social media  you know called a racist called a sexist
01:45:11 all of those things and which by the way i should say you know i would be perfectly happy to you know say you know
01:45:17 if we had time to say you know you know ten thousand times you know my  hatred of
01:45:24 racism of sexism of homophobia right but what i don't want to do is to cede to  some particular political
01:45:33 faction the right to define exactly what is meant by those terms to say well then
01:45:38 you have to agree with all of these other extremely contentious positions or else you are a misogynist
01:45:45 or else you are a racist right i say that well no you know you know don't
01:45:51 like don't i or you know don't people like me also get a say in the discussion
01:45:57 about you know what is racism about what is going to be the most effective to combat racism
01:46:04 right and you know this this this cancellation mentality i think is spectacularly ineffective
01:46:11 at its own professed goal of you know combating racism and sexism what's a positive way out so i i try to
01:46:18 i don't know if you see what i do on twitter but i on twitter i mostly and in my whole in my life
01:46:25 i've actually it's who i am to the core is like i really focus on the positive and i try to put love out there in the
01:46:32 world yeah and still i get attacked and i look at that and i wonder like are you two
01:46:39 i didn't know like i haven't actually said anything difficult and nuanced you talk about somebody like
01:46:45 steven pinker yeah who i actually don't know the full range of
01:46:51 things that that he's attacked for but he tries to say difficult he tries to be thoughtful about
01:46:56 difficult topics he does and obviously he just gets slaughtered by well i mean i mean i mean
01:47:04 i mean yes but it's also amazing how well steve has withstood it i mean he just survived that attempt to cancel him
01:47:10 just a couple of months ago right psychologically he survives it too which yeah worries me he says i don't think i
01:47:17 can yeah i i've gotten to know steve a bit he is incredibly unperturbed by this stuff  i i admire that and i envy it
01:47:25 i wish that i could be like that i mean my impulse when i'm getting attacked is i just want to engage
01:47:31 every single like anonymous person on twitter and reddit who is saying mean stuff about me and i wanted to say well look
01:47:38 can we just talk this over for an hour and then you know you'll see that i'm not that bad and you
01:47:43 know sometimes that even works the problem is then there's the you know the 20 000 other ones
01:47:49 right that's not but psychologically does that wear on you it does it does but yeah i mean in terms
01:47:55 of what is the solution i mean i wish i knew right and so you know in a certain way these problems are
01:48:02 maybe harder than p versus np right i mean  you know but but i think that part of it has to be for you know that
01:48:10 i think that there's a lot of sort of silent support for what i'll call the the the open
01:48:15 discourse side the you know reasonable enlightenment side and i think that that that support has
01:48:21 to become less silent right i think that a lot of people  this sort of you know
01:48:27 like agree that oh you know a lot of these cancellations and attacks are ridiculous but are just afraid to say so right or
01:48:34 else they'll get they'll get shouted down as well right that's just the standard witch
01:48:39 hunt dynamic which you know of course this  you know this faction understands and exploits to its great advantage
01:48:47 but you know if more people just you know said you know like we're not going to stand for this
01:48:52 right   you know you know this is this is you know where guess what we're against racism
01:48:57 too but you know this you know what you're doing is ridiculous right
01:49:02 you know and the hard part is like it takes a lot of mental energy it takes a lot of time
01:49:07 you know even if you feel like you're not going to be cancelled or you know you're staying on the safe side
01:49:13 like it takes a lot of time to  to to phrase things in exactly the right way and to  you know respond to everything people
01:49:20 say so but i think that you know the more people speak up than 
01:49:26  you know from from from all political persuasions you know from like all you know walks of life then you know
01:49:33 the the easier it is to move forward since we've been talking about love can you um
01:49:39 last time i talked to you about meaning of life a little bit but here has it's a weird question to ask a
01:49:45 computer scientist but has love for other human beings for for things for the world around you
01:49:53 played an important role in your life have you you know it's easy for a world-class
01:50:00 computer scientist   yeah you could even call yourself like a physicist
01:50:06 everything to be lost in the books is the connection to other humans love for other humans played an
01:50:13 important role i love my kids  i love my wife i love my parents  you know i
01:50:23 i'm probably not not different from most people and loving their families  and and in that being very important 
01:50:32 in my life  now i should remind you that you know i am a theoretical computer scientist
01:50:38 if you're looking for deep insight about the nature of love you're probably looking in the wrong place
01:50:45 to ask me but  but sure it's been important but is it  is there something from a computer science perspective to be said
01:50:51 about love is there  or is that is that even beyond into the realm of beyond
01:50:56 the realm of consciousness there was there was this great  cartoon i think it was one of the
01:51:03 classic xkcds where it shows like a heart and it's like you know squaring the heart taking the four-year transform of
01:51:09 the heart you know integrating the heart you know  
01:51:14 you know each each thing and then it says you know my normal approach is useless here
01:51:20 i'm so glad i asked this question i think there's no better way to  to end this guy i hope we get a chance
01:51:26 to talk again this has been an amazing cool experiment to do it outside yeah really glad you made it out yeah well i
