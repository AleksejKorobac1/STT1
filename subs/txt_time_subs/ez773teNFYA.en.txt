00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram a computer scientist mathematician and theoretical physicist
00:00:08 who is the founder and CEO of Wolfram research a company behind Mathematica Wolfram Alpha Wolfram language and the
00:00:16 new Wolfram physics project is the author of several books including a new kind of science which on a personal note
00:00:24 was one of the most influential books in my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence it made me fall
00:00:31 in love with the mathematical beauty and power of cellular automata it is true that perhaps one of the criticisms of
00:00:40 Stephen is in a human level that he has a big ego which prevents some researchers from fully enjoying the
00:00:46 content of his ideas we talked about this point in this conversation to me ego can lead you astray but can also be
00:00:54 a superpower one that fuels bold innovative thinking that refuses to surrender to the cautious ways of
00:01:02 academic institutions and here especially I ask you to join me in looking past the peculiarities of human
00:01:09 nature and opening your mind to the beauty of ideas and Stephens work and in this conversation
00:01:15 I believe Stephen Wolfram is one of the most original minds of our time and at the core is a kind curious and brilliant
00:01:24 human being this conversation was recorded in November 2000 nineteen when the Wolfram physics project was underway
00:01:30 but not yet ready for public exploration as it is now we now agreed to talk again probably multiple times in the near
00:01:39 future so this is round one and stay tuned for round two soon this is the artificial intelligence

00:04:18 you and your son Christopher helped create the alien language in the movie arrival so let me ask maybe a bit of a
00:04:26 crazy question but if aliens were to visit us on earth do you think we would be able to find a common language well
00:04:34 by the time we're saying aliens are visiting us we've already prejudiced the whole story because the
00:04:41 you know the concept of alien actually visiting so to speak we already know they're kind of things that make sense
00:04:48 to talk about visiting so we already know they exist in the same kind of physical setup that we do they're not
00:04:57 you know it's not just radio signals it's an actual thing that shows up and so on so I think in terms of you know
00:05:06 can one find ways to communicate well the best example we have of this right now is AI I mean that's our first sort
00:05:14 of example of alien intelligence and the question is how well do we communicate with AI you know if you were to say if
00:05:19 you were in the middle of a neural net and you open it up and it's like what are you thinking can you discuss things
00:05:27 with it it's not easy but it's not absolutely impossible so I think I think by the time but given the setup of your
00:05:35 question aliens visiting I think the answer is yes one will be able to find some form of communication whatever
00:05:41 communication means communication requires notions of purpose and things like this it's a kind of philosophical
00:05:49 quagmire so if AI is a kind of alien life-form what do you think visiting looks like so if we look at a
00:05:58 Lian's visiting yeah and we'll get to discuss computation and and the world of computation but if you were to imagine
00:06:04 you said you're already prejudiced something by saying you visit but what how would a lian's visit by visit
00:06:12 there's kind of an implication and here we're using the imprecision of human language you know in a world of the
00:06:18 future and if that's represented in computational language we might be able to take the the concept visit and go
00:06:26 look in the documentation basically and find out exactly what does that mean what properties does it have and so on
00:06:30 but by visit in ordinary human language I'm kind of taking it to be there's you know
00:06:38 something a physical embodiment that shows up in a spacecraft since we kind of know that that's necessary
00:06:47 we're not imagining it's just you know photons showing up in a radio signal that you know photons in some very
00:06:54 elaborate pattern we're imagining it's it's physical things made of atoms and so on that that show up can't be photons
00:07:02 in a pattern well that's good question I mean whether there is the possibility you know what counts as intelligence
00:07:10 good question I mean it's some you know and I used to think there was sort of a oh they'll be you know it'll be clear
00:07:16 what it means to find extraterrestrial intelligence etcetera etcetera etcetera I've I've increasingly realized as a
00:07:22 result of science that I've done that there really isn't a bright line between the intelligent and the merely
00:07:29 computational so to speak so you know in our kind of everyday sort of discussion will say things like you know the
00:07:34 weather has a mind of its own well we'd let's unpack that question you know we realize that there are
00:07:41 computational processes that go on that determine the fluid dynamics of this and that and the atmosphere or etcetera
00:07:47 etcetera etcetera how do we sting which distinguish that from the processes that go on in our brains of you know the
00:07:53 physical processes that go on in our brains how do we how do we had we separate those how do we say the the
00:08:00 physical processes going on that represents sophisticated computations in the weather oh that's not the same as
00:08:05 the physical processes that go on that represent sophisticated computations in our brains cancer is I don't think there
00:08:12 is a fundamental distinction I think the distinction for us is that there's kind of a a thread of history and so on that
00:08:20 connects kind of what happens in different brains to each other so to speak and it's a you know what happens
00:08:26 in the weather is something which is not connected by sort of a a thread of civilizational history so to speak to
00:08:34 what we're used to in our story in the stories that the human brains told us but maybe the weather has its own
00:08:39 stories that's Allah's house absolutely and that's and that's where we run into trouble thinking about extraterrestrial
00:08:44 intelligence because you know it's like that pulsar magnetosphere that's generating these
00:08:51 very elaborate radio signals you know is that something that we should think of as being this whole civilization that's
00:08:57 developed over the last however long you know millions of years of of processes going on in the in the neutron star or
00:09:05 whatever versus what you know what we're used to in human intelligence and I think it's a I think in the end you
00:09:10 know when people talk about extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it in the whole you know Fermi
00:09:16 paradox of how come there's no other signs of intelligence in the universe my guess is that we've got sort of two
00:09:25 alien forms of intelligence that we're dealing with artificial intelligence and sort of physical or extraterrestrial
00:09:33 intelligence and my guess is people will sort of get comfortable with the fact that both of these have been achieved
00:09:39 around the same time and in other words people will say well yes we're used to computers things we've created digital
00:09:46 things we've created being sort of intelligent like we are and they'll sell we're kind of also used to the idea that
00:09:51 there are things around the universe that are kind of intelligent like we are except they don't share the sort of
00:09:59 civilizational history that we have and so we don't they know they're they're a different branch
00:10:05 I mean it's similar to when you talk about life for instance I mean you you you kind of said life form I think
00:10:11 almost synonymously with intelligence which I don't think is is some you know I the the a eyes will be upset to hear
00:10:20 you I wait those guys I really probably implied biological life right right right but you're saying I mean we'll
00:10:27 explore this more but you're saying it's really a spectrum and it's all just the kind of computation and so it's it's a
00:10:35 full spectrum and we just make ourselves special by weaving a narrative around our particular kinds of computation yes
00:10:42 I mean what the thing that I think I've kind of come to realize is you know it's a little depressing to realize that
00:10:48 there's there's so little it's liberating well yeah but I mean it's you know it's the story of science right in
00:10:55 you know from Copernicus on it's like you know first we were like convinced a planets at the center of the universe no
00:11:02 that's not true well then we will convince there something very special about the chemistry that we have as
00:11:07 biological organisms now that's not really true and then we're still holding out that hope or this intelligence thing
00:11:13 we have that's really special yeah I don't think it is however in a sense as you say it's kind of liberating for the
00:11:20 following reason that you realize that what's special is the details of us not some abstract attribute that you know we
00:11:31 could wonder Oh is something else going to come along and you know also have that abstract attribute well
00:11:37 yes every abstract attribute we have something else has it but the full details of our kind of history of our
00:11:45 civilization and so on nothing else has that that's what you know that's our story so to speak and that's sort of one
00:11:51 most by definition special so I I view it as not being such a I mean I was initially I was like this
00:11:59 is bad this is this is kind of you know how can we have self-respect about some about the things that we do then I
00:12:06 realized the details of the things we do they are the story everything else is kind of a blank canvas so maybe on a
00:12:15 small tangent you just made me think of it but what do you make of the monolith in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of aliens
00:12:25 communicating with us and sparking the the kind of particular intelligent computation that we humans have is there
00:12:33 anything interesting to get from that sci-fi yeah I mean I think what's what's fun about that is you know the monoliths
00:12:41 are these you know one to four to nine perfect cuboid things and in the you know earth four million years ago
00:12:48 whatever they will pertain with a bunch of apes and so on a thing that has that level of
00:12:55 perfection seems out of place it seems very kind of constructed very engineered so that's an interesting question what
00:13:03 is the you know what's the techno signature so to speak what is it that you see it somewhere and you say my gosh
00:13:11 that had to be engineered now the fact is we see crystals which are also very
00:13:16 perfect and you know that the perfect ones are very perfect they're nice polyhedra or whatever and so in that
00:13:23 sense if you say well it's a sign of sort of it's a techno signature that it's a perfect you know a perfect
00:13:31 polygonal shape polyhedral shape that's not true and so then it's it's an interesting question what what is the
00:13:38 you know what is the right signature I mean like you know Gauss famous mathematician you know he had this idea
00:13:45 you should cut down the Siberian forest in the shape of sort of a typical image of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem
00:13:51 on the grounds that there's a kind of cool idea didn't get done but you know it's on the grounds that the
00:13:57 Martians would see that and realize gosh there are mathematicians out there it's kind of you know it's the in his theory
00:14:03 of the world that was probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievements of our species but you
00:14:10 know it's it's a it's a reasonable question what do you what can you send or create that is a sign of intelligence
00:14:20 in its creation or even intention in its creation you talk about if we were to send a beacon can you what what should
00:14:29 we send is math our greatest creation is what is our greatest creation I think I think in it's a it's a philosophically
00:14:36 doomed issue so I mean in other words you send something you think it's fantastic but it's kind of like we are
00:14:43 part of the universe we make things that are you know things that happen in the universe computation which is sort of
00:14:51 the thing that we are in some abstract sent you then sense using to create all these elaborate things we create is
00:14:59 surprisingly ubiquitous in other words we might have thought that you know we've built this whole giant engineering
00:15:06 stack that's led us to microprocessors that's led us to be able to do elaborate computations but this idea the
00:15:14 computations are happening all over the place the only question is whether whether there's a thread that connects
00:15:21 our human intentions to what those computations are and so I think I think this question of what do you send
00:15:28 to kind of show off our civilization in the best possible way I think any kind of almost random slab of stuff we've
00:15:37 produced is about equivalent to everything else I think it's one of these things where it's a non romantic
00:15:44 way of phrasing it I just started to interrupt but I just talked to it up Andrew in who's the wife of cross
00:15:51 hanging and so I don't know if you're familiar with the Voyager it's just part of its ascending I think
00:15:58 brainwaves of you know I wasn't it hers it was yeah her brain waves when she was first falling in love with Carl Sagan
00:16:06 right it's this beautiful story right that brand that perhaps you would shut down the power of that by saying we
00:16:12 might as well send anything else and that's interesting all of it is kind of an interesting peculiar thing that's
00:16:19 yeah yeah right well I mean I think it's kind of interesting to see on the on the Voyager you know golden record thing one
00:16:24 of the things that's kind of cute about that is you know it was made one was it in the late seventies early eighties
00:16:31 yeah and you know one of the things it's a phonograph record okay and it has a diagram how to play a
00:16:38 phonograph record and you know it's kind of like it's shocking that in just 30 years if you show that to a random kid
00:16:44 of today and you show them that diagram I've tried this experiment they're like I don't know what the heck this is and
00:16:51 the best anybody can think of is you know take the whole record forget the fact that it has some kind of helical
00:16:56 track in it just image the whole thing and see what's there that's what we would do today in only 30 years our
00:17:03 technology has kind of advanced to the point where the playing of a helical you know mechanical track on a phonograph
00:17:11 record is now something bizarre so you know it's it's that's a cautionary tale I would say in terms of the ability to
00:17:19 make something that in detail sort of leads by the nose some you know the aliens or whatever to do something it's
00:17:27 like no you know best you can do as I say if we were doing this today we would not build a helical scan thing with a
00:17:35 needle we would just take some high resolution imaging system and get all the bits off it
00:17:40 say oh it's a big nuisance that they put in a helix you know the spiral let's sum let's just you know unravel the spiral
00:17:50 and then start from there do you think and this will get into trying to figure out interpretability of AI
00:17:58 interpretability of computation being able to communicate with various kinds of computations do you think would be
00:18:05 able to if you're put put your alien hat on figure out this record how to play this record well it's a question of what
00:18:15 one wants to do I mean understand what the other party was trying to communicate or understand anything about
00:18:21 the other party what is understanding mean I mean that's the issue the issue is it's like what people were trying to
00:18:27 do natural language understanding for computers right so people try to do that for years it wasn't clear what it meant
00:18:35 in other words you take your piece of English or whatever and you say gosh my computer has understood this okay that's
00:18:43 nice what can you do with that well so for example when we did you know built wolf malphur you know one of the
00:18:50 things was it's you know it's doing question answering and so on it needs to do natural language understanding the
00:18:57 reason that I realized after the fact the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite well and
00:19:03 people hadn't before the number one thing was we had an actual objective for the natural language understand and we
00:19:09 were trying to turn the natural language into commentation into this computational language that we could
00:19:15 then do things with now similarly when you imagine your alien you say okay we're playing them the record did they
00:19:21 understand it well it depends what you mean if they you know if we if there's a representation that they have if it
00:19:27 converts to some representation where we can say oh yes that is a that's a representation that we can recognize is
00:19:35 represents understanding then all well and good but actually the only ones that I think we can say would represent
00:19:42 understanding a ones that will then do things that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us maybe a trying to
00:19:51 understand quantify how technological advances particular civilization is so are they a threat to
00:19:59 us from a military perspective yeah yeah that's probably the kind of first kind of understanding that would be
00:20:04 interested in gosh that's so hard I mean that's like in the arrival movie that was sort of one of the key questions as
00:20:10 is you know why are you here so to speak and it's I using a hurtis right but but even that is that you know it's a very
00:20:16 unclear you know it's like the the are you gonna hurt us that comes back to a lot of interesting area fix questions
00:20:22 because the you know we might make an AI that says blood take autonomous cars for instance you know are you gonna hurt us
00:20:30 well let's make sure you only drive at precisely the speed limit because we want to make sure we don't hurt you so
00:20:34 to speak because that's some and then well something you know but you say but actually that means I'm gonna be really
00:20:40 late for this thing and you know that sort of hurts me in some way so it's hard to know even even the definition of
00:20:49 what it means to hurt yeah someone is unclear and as we start thinking about things about AI ethics and so on that's
00:20:56 you know something one has to address there's always trade-offs and that's the annoying thing about ethics yeah well
00:21:02 right and I mean I think ethics like these other things we're talking about is a deeply human thing if there's no
00:21:09 abstract you know let's write down the theorem that proves that this is ethically correct that's a that's a
00:21:16 meaningless idea you know you have to have a ground truth so to speak that's ultimately sort of what humans want and
00:21:24 they don't all want the same thing so that gives one all kinds of additional complexity and thinking about that one
00:21:29 convenient thing in terms of turning ethics into computation you ask the question of what maximizes the
00:21:36 likelihood of the survival of the species that's a good existential issue but then when you say survival of the
00:21:47 species right you might say you might for example for example let's say forget about technology just you know hang out
00:21:55 and you know be happy live our lives go on to the next generation and you know go through many many generations where
00:22:01 in a sense nothing is happening that okay is that not okay hard to know in terms of
00:22:09 the attempt to do elaborate things and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of
00:22:15 the species like for instance I mean in in you know I think it's it's also a little bit hard
00:22:22 to know so ok let's take that as a sort of thought experiment ok you know you can say well what are the threats that
00:22:30 we might have to survive you know the supervolcano the asteroid impact the you know all these kinds of things ok so now
00:22:38 we inventory these possible threats and we say let's make our species as robust as possible relative to all these
00:22:45 threats I think in the end it's a it's sort of an unknowable thing what what it takes to you know so so given that
00:22:54 you've got this AI and you've told it maximize the long term what is long term mean does long term mean until the sun
00:23:02 burns out that's that's not gonna work and you know does long term mean next thousand years ok they're probably
00:23:09 optimizations for the next thousand years that it's like it's like if you're running a company you can make a company
00:23:16 be very stable for a certain period of time like if you know if your company gets bought by some you know private
00:23:24 investment group then they'll you know you can you can run a company just fine for five years by just taking what it
00:23:31 does and you know removing all R&D and the company will burn out after a while but it'll run just fine for a while so
00:23:38 if you tell the AI keep the humans okay for a thousand years there's probably a certain set of things that one would do
00:23:44 to optimize that many of which one might say well that would be a pretty big shame for the future of history so to
00:23:49 speak for that to be what happens but I think I think in the end you know as you start thinking about that question it is
00:23:57 what you realize is there's a whole sort of raft of undecidability computational irreducibility in other words it's I
00:24:05 mean one of the good things about sort of the the the what our civilization has gone through and what sort of we humans
00:24:12 go through is that there's a certain computational irreducibility to it in the sense that it isn't the case you can
00:24:18 look from the outside and just say the answer is going to be this at the end of the day this is what's
00:24:23 gonna happen you actually have to go through the process to find out and I think that's that's both that feels
00:24:30 better in the sense it's not a you know something is achieved by going through all of this all of this process and it's
00:24:39 but it also means that telling the a I go figure out you know what will be the best outcome well unfortunately it's
00:24:46 going to come back and say it's kind of undecidable what to do we'd have to run all of those scenarios to see what
00:24:53 happens and if we want it for the infinite future we're throwing immediately into a sort
00:24:59 of standard issues of of kind of infinite computation and so on so yeah even if you get that the answer to the
00:25:05 universe and everything is 42 you still have to actually run the universe yes yes like the question I guess or the the
00:25:16 you know the the journey is the point right well I think it's saying to summarize this is the result of the
00:25:23 universe yeah that's if that is possible it tells us I mean the whole sort of structure of thinking about computation
00:25:30 and so on and thinking about how stuff works if if there if it's possible to say and the answer is such-and-such
00:25:37 you're basically saying there's a way of going outside the universe and you're kind of you're getting yourself into
00:25:43 something of a sort of paradox because you're saying if it's knowable what the answer is then there's a way to know it
00:25:50 that is beyond what the universe provides but if we can know it then something that we're dealing with is
00:25:57 beyond the universe so then the universe isn't the universe so to speak so and in general as we'll talk about at least for
00:26:09 small human brains it's hard to show that the result of a sufficiently complex computation it's hard I mean
00:26:16 it's probably impossible right and there's a side ability so and the universe appears by at least the poets
00:26:26 to be sufficiently complex they won't be able to predict what the heck it's all going to well we better not be able to
00:26:32 because if we can kind of denies I mean it's you know we're part of the universe yeah so what
00:26:39 does it mean for us to predict it means that we that our little part of the universe is able to jump ahead of the
00:26:45 whole universe and you know this this quickly winds up I mean that there it is conceivable the only way we'd be able to
00:26:53 predict is if we are so special in the universe we are the one place where there is computation more special more
00:27:00 sophisticated than anything else that exists in the universe that's the only way we would have the ability to sort of
00:27:07 the almost theological ability so to speak to predict what happens in the universe is to say somehow we're we're
00:27:13 better than everything else in the universe which I don't think is the case yeah perhaps we can detect a large
00:27:23 number of looping patterns that reoccur throughout the universe and fully describe them and therefore but then
00:27:29 it's it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those patterns interact and what kind of well look the
00:27:35 most remarkable thing about the universe is that it has regularity at all might not be the case if you don't have
00:27:44 regularity absolutely therefore it's full of I mean physics is successful you know it's full of of laws that tell us a
00:27:51 lot of detail about how the universe works I mean it could be the case that you know the 10 to the 90th particles in
00:27:56 the universe they will do their own thing but they don't they all followed we already know they all follow
00:28:02 basically physical the same physical laws and that's something that's a very profound fact about the universe what
00:28:10 conclusion you draw from that is unclear I mean in the you know the early early theologians that was you know exhibit
00:28:18 number one for the existence of God now you know people have different conclusions about it
00:28:23 but the fact is you know right now I mean I happen to be interested actually I've just restarted a long-running kind
00:28:29 of interest of mine about fundamental physics I'm kind of like come on I'm on a bit of a quest which I'm about to make
00:28:38 more public of to to see if I can actually find the fundamental theory of physics excellence we'll come to that
00:28:45 and I just had a lot of conversation with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm really excited on your take because I
00:28:54 think you have a fascinating take on the the the fundamental notch in nature of our reality from a physics perspective
00:29:02 so and what might be underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today okay let's take a step back what is
00:29:10 computation it's a good question operationally computation is following rules that's kind of it
00:29:18 I mean computation is the result is the process of systematically following rules and it is the thing that happens
00:29:25 when you do that for taking initial conditions are taking inputs and following rules I mean what are you
00:29:32 following rules on so there has to be some data some not necessarily it can be something where that there's a you know
00:29:40 very simple input and then you're following these rules and you'd say there's not really much data going into
00:29:46 this it's you could actually pack the initial conditions into the rule if you want to so I think the the question
00:29:53 is is there a robust notion of computation that is what is this last mean what I mean by that is something
00:29:58 like this so so one of the things that are different in an earlier physics something like energy okay the different
00:30:06 forms of energy there's but somehow energy is the robust concept that doesn't isn't particular to kinetic
00:30:15 energy or you know nuclear energy or whatever else there's a robust idea of energy so only things you might ask is
00:30:21 there's the robust idea of computation or does it matter that this computation is running in a Turing machine this
00:30:27 computation is running in as you know CMOS Salkin CPU this computation is running in a fluid system in the whether
00:30:34 those kinds of things or is there a robust idea of computation that transcends the sort of detailed
00:30:41 framework that it's running in okay and is that her yes I mean it wasn't obvious that there was so it's worth
00:30:48 understanding the history and how we got to where we are right now because you know to say that there is is a statement
00:30:56 in part about our universe it's not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable it's about
00:31:03 what actually can exist for us maybe you can also comment because energy as a concept is robust but there's also its
00:31:15 intricate complicated relationship with matter with mass is very interesting of particles that carry force and particles
00:31:27 that sort of particles that carry forcing particles that have mass these kinds of ideas they seem to map to each
00:31:35 other at least in the mathematical sense is there a connection between energy and mass and computation or are these
00:31:44 completely disjoint ideas we don't know yet the things that I'm trying to do about fundamental physics may well lead
00:31:53 to such a connection but there is no known connection at this time so key can you elaborate a little bit more on what
00:32:01 how do you think about computation what is company yeah so I mean let's let's tell a little bit of a historical story
00:32:09 yes okay so you know back go back 150 years people were making mechanical calculators of various kinds and you
00:32:15 know the typical thing was do you want an adding machine you go to the adding machine store basically he wants a
00:32:20 multiplying machine you go to the multiplying machine store that different pieces of hardware and so that means
00:32:27 that at least at the level of that kind of computation and those kinds of pieces of hardware there isn't a robust notion
00:32:31 of computation there's the adding machine kind of computation there's the multiplying machine
00:32:37 notion of computation and they're disjoint so what happened in around 1900 people started imagining particularly in
00:32:45 the contests of mathematical logic could you have something which would be represent any reasonable function right
00:32:52 and they came up with things this idea of primitive recursion was one of the early ideas and it didn't work there
00:32:58 were reasonable functions that people who come up with that were not represented using the primitive as a
00:33:05 primitive recursion okay so then then along comes 1931 and girdle's theorem and so on
00:33:13 and as in looking back one can see that as part of the process of establishing girdles theorem girdle basically showed
00:33:20 how you could compile arithmetic you could basically compile logical statements like this statement is
00:33:28 unprovable into arithmetic so what he essentially did was to show that arithmetic can be a computer in a sense
00:33:35 that's capable of representing all kinds of other things and then Turing came along 1936 came up with Turing machines
00:33:42 meanwhile Alonzo Church had come up with lambda calculus and the surprising thing that was established very quickly is the
00:33:49 Turing machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same as the lambda calculus idea of what
00:33:56 computation might be and so and then there started to be other ideas you know register machines other kinds of other
00:34:02 kinds of representations of computation and the big surprise was they all turned out to be equivalent so in other words
00:34:09 it might have been the case like those old adding machines and multiplying machines that you know Turing had his
00:34:14 idea of computation church had his idea of computation and they were just different but it isn't true there are
00:34:21 actually all equivalent so then by I would say the the 1970s or so in in sort of the computation computer science
00:34:30 computation theory area people had sort of said Oh Turing machines are kind of what computation is physicists were
00:34:37 still holding out saying no no no it's just not how the universe works we've got all these differential equations
00:34:42 we've got all these real numbers that have infinite numbers of digits the universe is now a Turing machine
00:34:47 right the you know the Turing machines are a small subset of that the things that we make in microprocessors and
00:34:54 engineering structures and so on so probably actually through my work in the 1980s about sort of the relationship
00:35:02 between computation and models of physics it became a little less clear that there would be that there was this
00:35:12 big sort of dichotomy between what can happen in physics and what happens and things like Turing machines and I think
00:35:19 probably by now people would mostly think and and by the way brains were another kind of elements
00:35:24 this I mean you know girdle didn't think that his notion of computational what amounted to his notion of computation
00:35:32 would cover brains and Turing wasn't sure either but tell though he was a little bit
00:35:38 he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brains but so you know but I would say by probably
00:35:45 sometime in the 1980s there was beginning to be so a general belief that yes this notion of computation that
00:35:51 could be captured by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust now the next question is ok you can have a
00:36:01 universal Turing machine that's capable of being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do and you
00:36:09 know this idea of universal computation it's an important idea this idea that you can have one piece of hardware and
00:36:14 program it with different pieces of software you know that's kind of the idea that launched most modern
00:36:19 technology I mean that's kind of that that's the idea that launched computer revolution software etc so important
00:36:27 idea but but the thing that's still kind of holding out from that idea is ok there is this Universal computation
00:36:35 thing but seems hard to get to it seems like you want to make a universal computer you have to kind of have a
00:36:40 microprocessor with you know a million gates in it and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that
00:36:46 achieves that level of computational sophistication ok so the surprise for me was that stuff that I discovered in the
00:36:55 early 80s I'm looking at these things called cellular automata which are really simple computational systems the
00:37:02 thing that was a big surprise to me was that even when their rules were very very simple they were doing things that
00:37:08 were as sophisticated as they did even when their rules much more complicated so it didn't look like you know this
00:37:14 idea Oh to get sophisticated computation you have to build something with very sophisticated rules
00:37:21 that idea didn't seem to pan out and instead it seemed to be the case that sophisticated computation was completely
00:37:27 ubiquitous even in systems with incredibly simple rules and so that led to this thing that I call the principle
00:37:34 of computational equivalence which basically says when you have a system that follows rules of any kind then
00:37:43 whenever the system isn't doing things that are in some sense obviously simple then the computation that the behavior
00:37:51 of the system corresponds to is of equivalent sophistication so that means that when you kind of go from the very
00:37:57 very very simplest things you can imagine then quite quickly you hit this kind of threshold above which everything
00:38:04 is equivalent in its computational sophistication not obvious that would be the case I mean that's a science fact
00:38:11 well then hold on a second you saw this you've opened with a new kind of science I mean I remember it was
00:38:17 a huge eye-opener that's such simple things can create such complexity and yes there's an
00:38:25 equivalence but it's not a fact it just appears to I mean it's as much as a fact as sort of these theories are so elegant
00:38:36 that it it seems to be the way things are but let me ask sort of you just brought up previously kind of like the
00:38:44 communities of computer scientists with their touring machines the physicists will their universe and the whoever the
00:38:52 heck maybe neuroscientists looking at the brain what's your sense in the equivalence you've shown through your
00:39:02 work that simple rules can create equivalently complex touring machine systems right is the universe equivalent
00:39:15 to the kinds of tutorial machines is the human brain a kind of toy machine do you see those things basically blending
00:39:23 together or is there still a mystery about how disjoint they're well my guess is that they will blend together but we
00:39:30 don't know that for sure yet I mean this I you know I should say I I said rather glibly that the principle of
00:39:36 computational equivalence is sort of a science fact and this I was using half was yes efforts for the for the for the
00:39:45 science fact because when you it is a I mean just to talk about that for a second and most people will um
00:39:52 the thing is that it is it has a complicated epistemological character similar to things like the second law of
00:40:00 thermodynamics law of entropy increase the you know what is the second law of thermodynamics it is is it a law of
00:40:07 nature is that a thing that is true of the physical world is it is it something which is mathematically provable is it
00:40:13 something which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world is it in some sense a definition of heat
00:40:20 perhaps well it's a combination of those things and it's the same thing with the principle of computational equivalence
00:40:27 and in some sense the principle of computational equivalence is at the heart of the definition of computation
00:40:32 because it's telling you there is a thing there is a robust notion that is equivalent across all these systems and
00:40:39 doesn't depend on the details of each individual system and that's why we can meaningfully talk about a thing called
00:40:46 computation and we're not stuck talking about over there's computation in trillion machine number 378 5 and etc
00:40:53 etc etc that's that's why there is a robust notion like that now on the other hand can we prove the principle of
00:41:00 computational equivalence can we can we prove it as a mathematical result well the answer is actually we've got some
00:41:06 nice results along those lines that say you know throw me a random system with very simple rules well in a couple of
00:41:15 cases we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of a certain type are universal and do sort
00:41:22 of follow what you would expect from the principle of computational equivalence so that's a nice piece of sort of
00:41:27 mathematical evidence for the principle of computational equivalence did you still enjoy on that point the simple
00:41:34 rules creating sort of these complex behaviors but is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is
00:41:46 complex that you've mentioned you cross a threshold right is the various indicators so for example one thing
00:41:52 would be is it capable of universal computation that is given the system do there exist initial conditions for the
00:42:00 system that can be set up to essentially represent programs to do anything you to compute primes to compute pi to do
00:42:06 whatever he wants right so that's an indicator so we know in a couple of examples that yes the simplest
00:42:15 candidates that could conceivably have that property do have that property and that's what the principle of
00:42:19 computational equivalence might suggest but this principle of computational equivalence one question about it is is
00:42:28 it true for the physical world right it might be true for all these things we come up with the Turing machines the
00:42:34 cellular automata whatever else is it true for our actual physical world is it true for the Bray brains which are an
00:42:42 element of the physical world we don't know for sure and that's not the type of question that we will have a definitive
00:42:48 answer to because it's you know it's a it's a there's a there's a sort of scientific induction issue you can say
00:42:53 what's true for all these brains but this person over here is really special and it's not true for them and you can't
00:43:00 you know the the the only way that that cannot be what happens is if we finally nail it and actually get a fundamental
00:43:08 theory for physics and it turns out to correspond to let's say a simple program if that is the case then we will
00:43:14 basically have reduced physics to a branch of mathematics in a sense that we will not be you know right now with
00:43:20 physics we're like well this is the theory that you know this is the rules that apply here but in the middle of
00:43:27 that you know you know right by that black hole maybe these rules don't apply and
00:43:32 something else applies and there may be another piece of the onion that we have to peel back but as if if we can get to
00:43:39 the point where we actually have this is the fundamental theory of physics here it is it's this program run this program
00:43:46 and you will get our universe then we've kind of reduced the problem of figuring out things in physics to a problem of
00:43:52 doing some what turns out to be very difficult irreducibly difficult mathematical problems but it no longer
00:43:59 is the case that we can say that somebody can come in and say whoops you know you were right about all these
00:44:04 things about Turing machines but you're wrong about the physical universe we know there's sort of ground truth about
00:44:09 what's happening the physical universe now I happen to think I mean you asked me at an interesting time because I'm
00:44:16 just in the middle of starting to re-energized my my project to kind of study the fundamental theory of physics
00:44:25 as of today I'm very optimistic that we're actually going to find something and that it's going to be possible to to
00:44:30 see that the universe really is computational in that sense but I don't know because we're betting against you
00:44:37 know we're betting against the universe sort of speaking I didn't you know it's not like you know when I spend a lot of
00:44:43 my life building technology and then I know what what's in there right and it's there maybe it may have unexpected
00:44:48 behavior may have bugs things like that but fundamentally I know what's in there for the universe I'm not in that
00:44:53 position so to speak what kind of computation do you think the fundamental laws of physics might
00:45:03 emerge from so just to clarify so there's you've you've done a lot of fascinating work with kind of discrete
00:45:11 kinds of computation that you know use cellular automata and we'll talk about it have this very clean structure it's
00:45:18 such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules can create immense complexity but what you know is that
00:45:28 actually our cellular time is sufficiently general to describe the kinds of computation that might create
00:45:35 the laws of physics just to give it can you give a sense of what kind of computation do you think would create
00:45:41 well so so this is a slightly complicated issue because as soon as you have universal computation you can in
00:45:47 principle simulate anything with anything but it is not a natural thing to do and if you're asking will you to
00:45:55 try to find our physical universe by looking at possible programs in the computational universe of all possible
00:46:01 programs would the ones that correspond to our universe be small and simple enough that we might find them by
00:46:08 searching that computational universe we got to have the right basis so to speak we have to have the right language in
00:46:14 effect for describing computation for that to be feasible so the thing that I've been interested in for a long time
00:46:19 is what are the most structureless structures that we can create with computation so in other words if you say
00:46:26 a cellular automaton as a bunch of cells they're arrayed on a grid and it's very you know an
00:46:31 every cell is updated in synchrony at the sir at a particular you know when there's a there's a click of a clock
00:46:37 sort of speaking it goes a tick of a clock and that every cell gets updated at the same time that's a very specific
00:46:45 very rigid kind of thing but my guess is that when we look at physics and we look at things like space and time that
00:46:52 what's underneath space and time is something as structureless as possible that what we see what emerges for us as
00:47:00 physical space for example comes from something that is sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath and so I've been
00:47:07 for a long time interested in kind of what what are the most structureless structures that we can set up and
00:47:14 actually what I had thought about for ages is using graphs networks where essentially so they'll throw that space
00:47:23 for example so what is space the kind of a question one might ask back in the early days of quantum mechanics for
00:47:30 example people said oh for sure space is going to be discrete because all these other things were finding a discrete but
00:47:35 that never worked out in physics and so space and physics today is always treated as this continuous thing just
00:47:41 like Euclid imagined it I mean the the very first thing you chlid says and his sort of common notions is you know a
00:47:47 point is something which has no part in other words there are there are points that are arbitrarily small and there's a
00:47:53 continuum of possible positions of points and the question is is that true and so for example if we look at I don't
00:48:00 know fluid like air or water we might say oh it's a continuous fluid we can pour it we can do all kinds of things
00:48:06 continuously but actually we know because we know the physics of it that it consists of a bunch of discrete
00:48:10 molecules bouncing around and only in the aggregate is it behaving like a continuum and so the possibility exists
00:48:17 that that's true of space too people haven't managed to make that work with existing frameworks and physics but I've
00:48:24 been interested in whether one can imagine that underneath space and also underneath time is something more
00:48:32 structureless and the question is is it computational so there are couple possibilities it could be computational
00:48:38 somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine or it could be fundamentally not so how could it not be
00:48:44 it could not be so machine essentially deals with integers whole numbers some level and you know it
00:48:50 can do things like it can add one to a number it can do things like this you can also store whatever the heck it did
00:48:57 yes it has an infinite storage the storage but what temp when one thinks about doing physics or sort of idealized
00:49:06 physics or idealized mathematics one can deal with real numbers numbers with an infinite number of digits numbers which
00:49:13 are absolutely precise someone can say we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself are you
00:49:17 comfortable with infinity in this context are you gone very well in a context of computation do you think
00:49:25 infinity and plays a part I think that the role infinity is complicated infinity is useful in conceptualizing
00:49:32 things it's not actual izybelle almost by definition it's not actual I zabit do you think infinity is part of
00:49:38 the thing that might underlie the laws of physics I think that no I think there are many questions that you asked
00:49:46 about you might ask about physics which inevitably involve infinity like when you say you know is faster-than-light
00:49:52 travel possible you could say with it with with it we're given the laws of physics can you make something even
00:49:58 arbitrarily large even quotes infinitely large that you know that will make faster-than-light travel possible then
00:50:04 you you're thrown into dealing with infinity as a kind of theoretical question but I mean talking about you
00:50:11 know sort of what's underneath space and time and what how one can make you know a computational infrastructure one
00:50:18 possibility is that you can't make a computational infrastructure and Turing such in sense that you really have to be
00:50:25 dealing with precise real numbers you're dealing with partial differential equations which just have precise real
00:50:31 numbers that arbitrarily closely separated points you have a continuum forever thing could be that that that's
00:50:37 what happens that there's sort of a continuum for everything and precise real numbers for everything and then the
00:50:42 things I'm thinking about are wrong and you know that's that's the risk you take if you're you know if you're trying to
00:50:50 sort of do things about nature is you might just be wrong it's not it's for me personally it's kind of strange things
00:50:56 I've spent a lot of my life building technology where you can do something that nobody cares about but you can't be sort of
00:51:03 wrong in that sense and the sense you build your technology and it does what it does but but I think you know this
00:51:09 question of what you know what the sort of underlying computational infrastructure for the universe might be
00:51:16 it's so it's sort of inevitable it's gonna be fairly abstract because if you're gonna get all these things like
00:51:21 there are three dimensions of space there are electrons there are muons there are quarks there are this you
00:51:28 don't get to if the if the model for the universe is simple you don't get to have sort of a line of code for each of those
00:51:34 things you don't get to have sort of the the the muon case the Tau lepton case and so on or as they're all have to be
00:51:42 emergent some right so something deeper right so so that means it's sort of inevitable that's a little hard to talk
00:51:47 about what the sort of underlying structural is structure actually is do you think our human beings have the
00:51:55 cognitive capacity to understand if we're to discover it to understand the kinds of simple structure from which
00:52:02 these laws can emerge like do you think that's a good class pursuit well here's what I think I think that I mean I'm
00:52:08 right in the middle of this right now I'm telling you that I think you this one yeah I mean this human has a hard
00:52:15 time understanding it you know a bunch of the things that are going on but but what happens in understanding is one
00:52:20 builds waypoints I mean if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics starting from you know
00:52:29 counting back in you know whenever counting was invented 50,000 years ago whenever it was right there's that will
00:52:35 be really difficult but what happens is we build waypoints that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding and we
00:52:41 see the same thing happening in language you know when we invent a word for something it provides kind of a
00:52:47 cognitive anchor a kind of a waypoints that lets us you know like a podcast or something you could be explaining well
00:52:53 it's a thing which this works this way that way the other way but as soon as you have the word podcast and people
00:53:00 kind of societally understand it you start to be able to build on top of that and so I think and that that's kind of
00:53:06 the story of science actually - I mean science is about building these kind of waypoints where we find this sort of cognitive
00:53:13 mechanism for understanding something then we can build on top of it you know we we have the idea of I don't know
00:53:18 differential equations we can build on top of that we have this idea of that idea so my hope is that if it is the
00:53:26 case that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand to the computer and there's no way points in between then
00:53:33 we're toast we won't be able to do that well eventually we might so for if we're as clever apes are good enough a
00:53:40 building those abstract abstractions eventually from sanh we'll get to the computer a and it just might be a longer
00:53:46 journey the question is whether it is something that you asked whether our human brains yes
00:53:51 well on will quotes understand what's going on and that's a different question because for that it requires steps that
00:53:59 are for whether it is sort of from which we can construct a human understandable narrative and that's something that I
00:54:07 think I am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible although you know as of literally today if you ask me I'm
00:54:13 confronted with things that I don't understand very well and so this is a small pattern in a computation trying to
00:54:21 understand the rules under which the computation functions and yeah it's it's an interesting possibility under which
00:54:29 kinds of computations such a creature can understand itself my guess is that within so we didn't talk much about
00:54:36 computational irreducibility but it's a consequence of this principle of computational equivalence and it's sort
00:54:41 of a core idea that that one has to understand I think which is question is you're doing a computation you can
00:54:47 figure out what happens in the computation just by running every step in the computation and seeing what
00:54:53 happens or you can say let me jump ahead and figure out you know have something smarter that figures out what's gonna
00:55:00 happen before it actually happens and a lot of traditional science has been about that act of computational reduce
00:55:07 ability it's like we've got these equations and we can just solve them or we can figure out what's going to happen
00:55:13 we don't have to trace all of those steps we just jump ahead because we've solved these equations okay so one of
00:55:18 the things that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is you don't always get to do that many
00:55:23 many systems will be computationally irreducible in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is just follow each
00:55:29 step and see what happens why is that well if you have if you're saying well we with our brains will are smarter we
00:55:36 we don't have to mess around like the little cellular automata and going through and updating all those cells we
00:55:42 can just you know use the power of our brains to jump ahead but if the principle of computational occurrence is
00:55:47 right that's not going to be correct because it means that there's us during our computation in our brains there's a
00:55:55 little cellular automaton doing its computation and the principle of computational current says these two
00:56:00 computations are fundamentally equivalent so that means we don't get to say we're a lot smarter than the
00:56:05 cellular automaton and jump ahead because we're just doing computation that's of the same sophistication as the
00:56:11 cellular automaton itself that's computation or disability it's fascinating but the and that's a really
00:56:16 powerful idea I think that's both depressing and humbling and so on that were all we in a
00:56:24 cellular automata are the same but the question we're talking about the fundamental laws of physics is kind of
00:56:30 the reverse question you're not predicting what's gonna happen you have to run the universe for that but saying
00:56:37 can I understand what rules likely generated me I understand but the problem is to know whether you're right
00:56:45 you have to have some computational reduce ability because we are embedded in the universe if the only way to know
00:56:50 whether we get the universe is just to run the universe we don't get to do that because it just ran for fourteen point
00:56:56 six billion years or whatever and we don't you know we can't rerun it so to speak so we have to hope that there are
00:57:03 pockets of computational reducibility sufficient to be able to say yes I can recognize those or electrons there and
00:57:10 and and I think that it is a it's a feature of computational irreducibility it's sort of a mathematical feature that
00:57:15 there are always an infinite collection of pockets of reduced ability the question of whether they land in the
00:57:20 right place and whether we can sort of build the theory based on them is unclear but to this point about you know
00:57:27 whether we as observers in the universe built out of the same stuff as the universe can figure out the universe so
00:57:34 to speak that relies on these pockets of reducibility without the pockets of reducibility it's won't work
00:57:40 work but I think this question about how observers operate it's one of the features of science over the last
00:57:48 hundred years particularly has been that every time we get more realistic about observers we learn a bit more about
00:57:54 science so for example relativity was all about observers don't get to say when you know what's simultaneous with
00:58:01 what they have to just wait for the light signal to arrive to decide what simultaneous or for example in
00:58:08 thermodynamics observers don't get to say the position of every single molecule and a gas they can only see the
00:58:14 kind of large scale features and that's why the second law of thermodynamics law of entropy increased and so on works if
00:58:21 you could see every individual molecule you wouldn't conclude something about thermodynamics you would conclude oh
00:58:28 these molecules just all doing these particular things you wouldn't be able to see this aggregate fact so I strongly
00:58:35 expect that in fact him the theories that I have the one has to be more realistic about the computation and
00:58:43 other aspects of observers in order to actually make a correspondence between what we experience in fact they have a
00:58:49 my little team and I have a little theory right now about how quantum mechanics may work which is a very
00:58:57 wonderfully bizarre idea about how a sort of thread of human consciousness relates to what we observe in the
00:59:04 universe but this is the several steps to explain what that's about woody meek of the mess of the observer
00:59:11 at the lower level of quantum mechanics sort of the textbook definition with quantum mechanics kind of says that
00:59:21 there's some there's two worlds one is the world that actually is and the other is that's observed do ya what do you
00:59:31 make sense of well I think actually the ideas we've recently had might actually give away into this and that's I don't
00:59:42 know yet I mean it's I think that's it's a mess I mean the fact is there is a one of the things that's interesting and
00:59:49 when you know people look at these models that I started talking about 30 years ago now
00:59:53 they say oh no that can't possibly be right you know what about quantum mechanics right you say okay tell me
01:00:00 what is the essence of quantum mechanics what do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that I've got quantum
01:00:05 mechanics so to speak well and that question comes up it comes up very operationally actually because we've
01:00:10 been doing a bunch of stuff with quantum computing and there are all these companies that say we have a quantum
01:00:15 computer and we say let's connect to your API and let's actually run it and they're like well maybe you shouldn't do
01:00:21 that yet we're not quite ready yet and one of the questions that I've been curious about
01:00:26 is if I have five minutes with a quantum computer how can I tell if it's really a quantum computer or whether it's a
01:00:32 simulator at the other end right and turns out it's really hard it turns out there isn't it's it's it's like a lot of
01:00:38 these questions about sort of what is intelligence what's life it's soaring tears for quantum computing that's right
01:00:44 that's right it's like are you really a quantum computer and I mean I think simulation the yes exactly is it just a
01:00:50 simulation or is it really a quantum computer famous you're all over again but but that so you know this this whole
01:00:58 issue about the sort of mathematical structure of quantum mechanics and the completely separate thing that is our
01:01:06 experience in which we think definite things happen but as quantum mechanics doesn't say definite things ever happen
01:01:11 quantum mechanics is all about the amplitudes for different things to happen but yet our thread of
01:01:19 consciousness operates as if definite things are happening but to linger on the point you've kind of mentioned the
01:01:27 structure that could underlie everything in this idea that it could perhaps have something like a structure of a graph
01:01:36 can you elaborate why your intuition is that there's a graph structure of nodes and edges and what it might represent
01:01:45 right okay so the question is what is in a sense the most structureless structure you can imagine right so and in fact
01:01:54 what I've recently realized in the last year or so I have a new most structureless structure by the way the
01:02:01 question itself is a beautiful and a powerful one in itself so even without an answer just the question is
01:02:07 strong question right right well what's your new idea well it has to do with hypergraphs essentially what what is interesting
01:02:17 about the sort of ID model I have now is it's a little bit like what happened with computation everything that I think
01:02:24 of as oh well maybe the model is this I discover its equivalent and that's quite encouraging because
01:02:31 it's like I could say well I'm gonna look at trivalent graph the graphs with you know three edges for each node and
01:02:36 so on or I could look at this special kind of graph or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure and turns
01:02:43 out that the things I'm now looking at everything that I've imagined that is a plausible type of structuralist
01:02:51 structure is equivalent to this so what is it well a typical way to think about it is well so you might have some some
01:03:06 collection of tuples collection of let's say numbers so you might have one three five two three four little just
01:03:15 collections of numbers triples of numbers let's say quadruples of numbers pairs of numbers whatever and you have
01:03:23 all these sort of floating little tuples they're not in any particular order and that sort of floating collection of
01:03:32 tuples and I told you this was abstract represents the whole universe the only thing that relates them is when a symbol
01:03:41 is the same it's the same so to speak so if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol let's say at the same
01:03:47 position of the tuple of the first element of the tuple then that's represents a relation okay so let me let
01:03:56 me try and peel this back Wow okay it's it's I told you it's abstract but this is this is the this is so the
01:04:02 relationship is formed by the same some aspect of sameness right but but so think about it in terms of a graph yeah
01:04:09 so a graph a bunch of nodes let's say you number each node okay then what is a graph a graph is a set of pairs that say
01:04:18 this node has an edge connecting it to this other node so that's the that's an a graph is just
01:04:26 a collection of those pairs that say this node connects to this other node so this is a generalization of that in
01:04:33 which instead of having pairs you have arbitrary and tuples that's it that's the whole story and now the question
01:04:41 is okay so that might be that might represent the state of the universe how does the universe evolved what does the
01:04:47 end of us do and so the answer is that what I'm looking at is transformation rules on these hyper graphs in other
01:04:58 words you say this whenever you see a a piece of this hyper graph that looks like this turn it into a piece of hyper
01:05:05 graph that looks like this so on a graph it might be when you see the sub graph when you see this thing with a bunch of
01:05:10 edges hanging out in this particular way then rewrite it as this other graph mm-hm okay and so that's the whole story so
01:05:21 the question is what so now you say I mean think as I say this is quite abstract and one of the questions is
01:05:29 where do you do those updating so you've got this giant graph what triggers outdating like what's the what's the
01:05:37 ripple effect of it is it yeah and I I suspect everything's discrete even in time so okay so the question is where do you do
01:05:45 the updates yes and the answer is the rule is you do them wherever they apply and you do them you do them the order in
01:05:52 which the updates is done is not defined that is the you can do them so there may be many possible orderings for these
01:05:59 updates now the point is if imagine you're an observer in this universe so and you say did something get updated
01:06:07 well you don't in any sense know until you yourself have been updated right so in fact all that you can be sensitive to
01:06:17 is essentially the causal network of how an event over there affects an event that's in you it doesn't even feel like
01:06:26 observation that's like that's something else you're just part of the whole thing yes you're part of it but but even to
01:06:33 have so the the end result of that is you're sensitive to is this causal network of what event effects what other
01:06:40 event I'm not making a big statement about sort of the structure of the observer I'm simply saying I'm simply
01:06:47 making the argument that what happens the microscopic order of these rewrites is not something that any observer any
01:06:54 conceivable observer in this universe can be affected by because the the only thing the observer can be affected by is
01:07:04 this causal network of how the events in the observer are affected by other events that happen in the universe so
01:07:09 the only thing you have to look at is the causal network you don't really have to look at this microscopic rewriting
01:07:15 that's happening so these rewrites are happening wherever they they were they happen wherever they feel like causal
01:07:21 network is there you said that there's not really so the idea would be an undefined like what gets updated the the
01:07:30 sequence of things is undefined it's a yes that's what you mean by the causal network then the cop no the causal
01:07:37 network is given that an update has happened that's an event then the question is is that event causally
01:07:44 related to does that event if that event didn't happen then some future event couldn't happen yet gotcha
01:07:51 and so you build up this network of what effects what okay and so what that does so when you build up that network that's
01:07:59 kind of the observable aspect of the universe in some sense yeah and so then you can ask questions
01:08:05 about you know how robust is that observable ass network of the what's happening in the universe okay so here's
01:08:11 where it starts getting kind of interesting so for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules the order of
01:08:19 rewrites does not matter to the causal network and so this is okay mathematical logic moment this is equivalent to the
01:08:26 church-rosser property of a confluence property of rewrite rules and it's the same reason that if you are simplifying
01:08:33 an algebraic expression for example you can say oh let me expand those terms out let me factor those pieces doesn't
01:08:39 matter what order you do that in you'll always get the same answer and that's it's the same fundamental phenomenon
01:08:45 that causes for certain kinds of microscopic rewrite that causes the causal network to be
01:08:52 independent of the microscopic order of rewritings why is there properly important because it implies special
01:09:00 relativity I mean the reason what the reason it's important is that that property special relativity says you can
01:09:10 look at these sort of you can look at different reference frames you can have different you can be looking at your
01:09:16 notion of what space and what's time can be different depending on whether you're traveling at a certain speed depending
01:09:20 on whether you're doing this that and the other but nevertheless the laws of physics are the same that's what the
01:09:26 principle special relativity says there's the laws of physics are the same independent of your reference frame well
01:09:34 turns out this sort of change of the microscopic rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of
01:09:39 reference frame or at least there's a sub part of how that works that's a call interchange a reference frame so
01:09:46 somewhat surprisingly and sort of for the first time and forever it's possible for an underlying microscopic theory to
01:09:53 imply special relativity to be able to derive it it's not something you put in as a this is a it's something where this
01:10:02 other property causal invariance which is also the property that implies that there's a single thread of time in the
01:10:08 universe it might not be the case that that's that is the that's what would lead to the possibility of an observer
01:10:16 thinking that definite stuff happens otherwise you've got all these possible rewriting orders and who's to say which
01:10:22 one occurred but with this causal invariance property there's a there's a notion of a definite threat of time it
01:10:27 sounds like that kind of idea of time even space would be emergent from the system oh yeah no it's not a fundamental
01:10:35 part of the fundamental level all you've got is a bunch of nodes connected by hyper edges or whatever so there's no
01:10:41 time there's not space that's right and but but the the thing is that it's just like imagining imagine you're just
01:10:47 dealing with a graph and imagine you have something like a you know like a honeycomb graph we have a hexagon bunch
01:10:51 a hexagon you know that graph at a microscopic level is just a bunch of nodes connected
01:10:57 to other nodes but at a microscopic level you say that looks like a honeycomb you know
01:11:02 it's lattice it looks like a two-dimensional you know manifold of some kind it looks like a
01:11:08 two-dimensional thing if you connect it differently if you just connect all the nodes one one to another and kind of a
01:11:14 sort of linked list type structure then you'd say well that looks like a one-dimensional space but at the
01:11:19 microscopic level all these are just networks with nodes the macroscopic level they look like something that's
01:11:25 like one of our sort of familiar kinds of space and it's the same thing with these hyper graphs now if you ask me
01:11:32 have I found one that gives me three dimensional space the answer is not yet so we don't know this is one of these
01:11:38 things we're kind of betting against nature so to speak and I have no way to know I mean so there are many other
01:11:44 properties of this this kind of system that have are very beautiful actually and very suggestive and it will be very
01:11:51 elegant if this turns out to be right because it's very it's very clean and you start with nothing and everything
01:11:57 gets built up everything about space everything about time everything about matter it's all just emergent from the
01:12:04 properties of this extremely low-level system and that that will be pretty cool if that's the way our universe works
01:12:12 now do I on the other hand the thing that that I find very confusing is let's say we succeed let's say we can say this
01:12:22 particular sort of hyper graph rewriting rule gives the universe just run that hyper graph rewriting rule for enough
01:12:29 times and you'll get everything you'll get this conversation we're having will you'll get everything it's that if we
01:12:39 get to that point and we look at what is this thing what is this rule that we just have that is giving us our whole
01:12:44 universe how do we think about that thing let's say turns out the minimal version of this and this is kind of cool
01:12:51 thing for a language designer like me the the minimal version of this model is actually a single line of orphan
01:12:58 language code so that's I wasn't sure is going to happen that way but it's it's a that's it's kind of now we don't know
01:13:06 what we don't know what that's that's just the framework to know the actual particular hypergraph that might be a
01:13:12 longer that the specification of the rules might be slightly like how does help you except marveling in the beauty
01:13:19 and the elegance of the simplicity that creates the universe that does that help us predict anything not really because
01:13:26 of the irreducibility that's correct that's correct but so the thing that is really strange to me and I haven't
01:13:32 wrapped my my brain around this yet is you know one is one keeps on realizing that we're not special in the sense that
01:13:41 you know we don't live at the center of the universe we don't blah blah blah and yet if we produce a rule for the
01:13:49 universe and it's quite simple and we can write it down and a couple of lines or something that feels very special how
01:13:57 do we come to get a simple universe when many of the available universes so to speak are incredibly complicated might
01:14:04 be you know a quintillion characters long why did we get one of the ones that's simple and so I haven't wrapped
01:14:11 my brain around that asou yet if indeed we are in such a simple way the universe is such a simple rule is it possible
01:14:20 that there is something outside of this that we are in a kind of what people calls to the simulation right the word
01:14:27 just part of a computation is being explored by a graduate student in alternate universe well you know the
01:14:34 problem is we don't get to say much about what's outside our universe because by definition our universe is
01:14:40 what we exist within yeah now can we make a sort of almost theological conclusion from being able to know how
01:14:46 our particular universe works interesting question I don't think that if you ask the question could we and it
01:14:55 relates again to this question about the extraterrestrial intelligence you know we've got the rule for the universe was
01:15:02 it built in on purpose hard to say that's the same thing as saying we see a signal from you know that we're you know
01:15:10 receiving from some you know random star somewhere and it's a series of pulses and you know it's a periodic series of
01:15:17 pulses let's say was that done on purpose can we conclude something about the origin of that series of pulses just
01:15:23 because it's elegant does not necessarily mean that somebody created it or though
01:15:30 can even comprehend yeah well yeah I think it's it's the ultimate version of the sort of identification of the techno
01:15:37 signature question it's the ultimate version of that is was our universe a piece of technology so to
01:15:43 speak and how on earth would we know because but I mean it'll be it's some I mean you know in the kind of crazy
01:15:49 science fiction thing you could imagine you could say Oh somebody's going to have them you know that's gonna be a
01:15:54 signature there it's gonna be you know made by so-and-so but there's no way we could understand that sort of speaking
01:16:01 it's not clear what that would mean because the universe simply you know this if we find a rule for the universe
01:16:10 we're not we're simply saying that rule represents what our universe does we're not saying that that rule is something
01:16:18 running on a big computer and making our universe it's just saying that represents what our universe does in the
01:16:24 same sense that you know laws of classical mechanics differential equations whatever they are represent
01:16:30 what mechanical systems do it's not that the mechanical systems are somehow running solutions to those differential
01:16:37 equations those differential equations just representing the behavior of those systems so what's the gap in your sense
01:16:44 to linger and the fascinating perhaps slightly sci-fi a question what's the gap between understanding the
01:16:50 fundamental rules that create a universe and engineering a system actually creating a simulation ourselves so
01:16:58 you've talked about sort of you've talked about you know nano engineering kind of ideas that are kind of exciting
01:17:04 actually creating some ideas of computation in the physical space how hard it is is it as an engineering
01:17:10 problem to create the universe once you know the rules the Creator and well it's an interesting question I think the
01:17:16 substrate on which the universe is operating is not a substrate that we have access to I mean the only substrate
01:17:23 we have is that same substrate that the universe is operating in so if the universe is a bunch of hypergraphs being
01:17:29 rewritten then we get to attach ourselves to those same hypergraphs being rewritten we don't get to and if
01:17:37 you ask the question you know is the code clean you know is you know can we write nice elegant code
01:17:45 with efficient algorithms and so on well that's an interesting question how how you know that's this question of how
01:17:50 much computational reducibility there is in the system but so I've seen some beautiful cellular automata that
01:17:55 basically create copies of itself within itself right that's the question whether it's possible to create like whether you
01:18:02 need to understand the substrate or whether you can just yeah well right I mean so one of the things that is sort
01:18:09 of one of my slightly sci-fi thoughts about the future so to speak is you know right now if you pol typical people who
01:18:16 say do you think it's important to find the fundamental theory of physics you get because I've done this poll
01:18:22 informally at least it's curious actually you get a decent fraction of people saying oh yeah that would be
01:18:28 pretty interesting I think that's becoming surprisingly enough more I mean a lot of people are interested in
01:18:37 physics in a way that like without understanding it just kind of watching scientists a very small number of them
01:18:45 struggle to understand the nature of our reality right mean I I mean I I think that's somewhat true and in fact in this
01:18:52 project that I'm launching into to try and find in fundamental theory of physics I'm going to do it as a very
01:18:57 public project I mean it's gonna be live streamed and all this kind of stuff and I don't know what will happen it'll be
01:19:03 kind of fun I mean I think that it's the interface to the world of this project I mean I I figure one feature of this
01:19:12 project is you know unlike technology projects that basically are what they are this is a project that might simply
01:19:17 fail because it might be the case that generates all kinds of elegant mathematics that has absolutely nothing
01:19:22 to do with the physical universe that we happen to live in well okay so we're talking about kind of the quest to find
01:19:30 the fundamental theory physics first point is you know it's turned out it's kind of hard to find the fundamental
01:19:35 theory physics people weren't sure that that would be the case back in the early days of applying mathematics to science
01:19:44 1600s and so on people were like oh and a hundred years we'll know everything there is to know about how the universe
01:19:49 works turned out to be harder than that and people got kind of humble at some level because every time we got to a
01:19:55 sort of a greater level of smallness and universe it seemed like the math got more complicated and everything got got
01:20:03 harder the you know when I when I was a kid basically I started doing particle physics and you know what I was doing
01:20:09 particle physics I always thought finding the fundamental fundamental theory of physics that's a
01:20:15 kooky business we'll never be able to do that but we can operate within these frameworks that we built for doing
01:20:21 quantum field theory and general relativity and things like this and it's all good and we can figure out a lot of
01:20:27 stuff did you even at that time have a sense that there's something behind that sure I just didn't expect that I thought
01:20:36 in some rather on it's actually kind of crazy and thinking back on it because it's kind of like there was this long
01:20:42 period in civilization where people thought the ancients had it all figured out and we'll never figure out oh
01:20:47 nothing new and to some extent that's the way I felt about physics when I was in the middle of doing it so to speak
01:20:54 and was you know we've got quantum field theory it's the foundation of what we're doing and there's you know yes there's
01:21:00 probably something underneath this but we'll sort of never figure it out but then I started studying simple programs
01:21:07 and the computational universe things like solar automata and so on and I discovered that there so they do all
01:21:14 kinds of things that were completely at odds with the intuition that I had had and so after that after you see this
01:21:21 tiny little program that does all this amazingly complicated stuff then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about
01:21:27 physics and saying maybe we could do this for physics too and so that's some that got me started years ago now and
01:21:36 this kind of idea of could we actually find what's underneath all of these frameworks like one a field theory in
01:21:41 jorts everything's on and people perhaps don't realize as slow as they might that you know the frameworks we're using for
01:21:47 physics which is basically these two things quantum field theory the sort of the theory of small stuff and general
01:21:54 relativity theory of gravitation and large stuff those are the two basic theories and they're 100 years old I
01:22:01 mean general relativity was 1915 quantum field theory well 1920s I'm basically a hundred years old
01:22:08 and they've they've it's been a good run there's a lot of stuff been figured out but what's interesting is the
01:22:15 foundations haven't changed in all that period of time even though the foundations had changed several times
01:22:20 before that in the two hundred years earlier than that and I think the kinds of things that I'm thinking about
01:22:26 which is sort of really informed by thinking about computation in the computational universe it's a different
01:22:32 foundation it's a different set of foundations and might be wrong but it is at least you know we have a shot and I
01:22:41 think it's you know to me it's you know my personal calculation for myself is is you know if it turns out that the
01:22:49 finding the fundamental theory of physics it's kind of low-hanging fruit so to speak
01:22:54 it'd be a shame if we just didn't think to do it you know if people just said oh you'll never figure that stuff out let's
01:23:00 you know and it takes another two hundred years before anybody gets around to doing it you know I think it's I
01:23:08 don't know how low-hanging this fruit actually is it may be you know it may be that it's kind of the wrong century to
01:23:16 do this project I mean I think the the the cautionary tale for me you know I think about things that I've tried to do
01:23:23 in technology where people thought about doing them a lot earlier and my favorite example is probably live Nets who-who
01:23:30 thought about making essentially encapsulating the world's knowledge in a computational form in the late 1600s and
01:23:38 did a lot of things towards that and basically you know we finally managed to do this but he was three hundred years
01:23:44 too early and that's the that's kind of the in terms of life planning it's kind of like avoid things that can't be done
01:23:52 in your in your century so to speak yeah timing timing is everything you so you think if we kind of figure out the
01:24:02 underlying rules that can create from which quantum field theory in general relativity can emerge do you think
01:24:08 they'll help us unify it at that level of track we'll know it completely we'll know how that all fits together
01:24:14 yes without a question and I mean it's already even the things I've already done they're a very you know it's very
01:24:22 very elegant actual how things seem to be fitting together now you know is it right I don't know
01:24:29 yet it's awfully suggestive if it isn't right it's some then the designer of the universe should feel embarrassed so to
01:24:36 speak because it's a really good way to do that in your intuition in terms of design universe does God play dice is
01:24:44 there is there randomness in this thing or is it deterministic so the kind of guy that's a little bit of a complicated
01:24:50 question because when you're dealing with these things that involve these rewrites that have okay even randomness
01:24:57 is an emergent phenomenon perhaps yes I mean it's a yeah well randomness in in many of these systems pseudo randomness
01:25:03 and randomness are hard to distinguish in this particular case the current idea that we have about some measurement
01:25:13 in quantum mechanics is something very bizarre and very abstract and I don't think I can yet explain it without kind
01:25:21 of yakking about very technical things eventually I will be able to but if that's if that's right it's kind of a
01:25:28 it's a weird thing because it slices between determinism and randomness in a weird way that hasn't been sliced before
01:25:36 so to speak so like many of these questions that come up in science where it's like is that this or is it that
01:25:42 turns out the real answer is it's neither of those things it's something kind of different and sort of orthogonal
01:25:49 to those those those categories and so that's the current you know this week's idea about how that might work but
01:25:57 you know we'll we'll see how that term unfolds I mean there's there's this question about a field like physics and
01:26:03 sort of the quest for a fundamental theory and so on and there's both the science of what happens and there's the
01:26:10 the sort of the social aspect of what happens because you know in a field that is basically as old as physics we're at
01:26:18 I don't know what it is fourth generation I don't know fourth generation I don't know what generation
01:26:23 it is of physicists and like I was one of these so to speak and for me the foundations were like the pyramids so to
01:26:30 speak you know it was that way and it was always that way it is difficult in an old field to go
01:26:36 back to the foundations and would think about rewriting them it's a lot easier in young fields where you're still
01:26:42 dealing with the first generation of people who invented the field and it tends to be the case you know that the
01:26:48 nature of what happens in science tends to be you know you'll get there typically the pattern is some
01:26:55 methodological advanced occurs and then there's a period of five years ten years maybe a little bit longer than that
01:27:00 where there's lots of things that are now made possible whether by that methodological advance whether it's you
01:27:07 know I don't know telescopes or whether that's some mathematical method or something it's you know there's a
01:27:15 something something happens a tool gets built and then you can do a bunch of stuff and there's bunch of low-hanging
01:27:22 fruit to be picked and that takes a certain amount of time after that all that low-hanging fruit is picked then
01:27:29 it's a hard slog for the next however many decades or century or more to get to the next sort of level at which one
01:27:38 can do something and it's kind of a a.m. and it tends to be the case that in fields that are in that kind of but I
01:27:42 wouldn't say cruise mode because it's really hard work but it's very hard work for very incremental progress
01:27:49 and the in your career and some of the things you've taken on it feels like you're not you haven't been afraid of
01:27:57 the hard slog the also true so it's quite interesting especially on the engineering on the engineering side and
01:28:04 a small tangent when you were a Caltech did you get to interact with Richard five-minute ology aviemore he's very
01:28:12 sure we we work together quite a bit actually in fact on and in fact both when I was at Caltech and after I left Caltech
01:28:20 we were both consultants at this company called Thinking Machines Corporation which was just down the street from here
01:28:26 actually ultimately ill-fated company but I used to say this company is not going to work with the strategy they
01:28:32 have and dick Feynman always used to say what do we know about running companies just let them run their company but 
01:28:41 anyway I was there he was not into into that kind of thing and he always thought it was thought that my interest in doing
01:28:46 things like running companies was a was a distraction so to speak and for me it's a it's a mechanism to have a
01:28:55 more effective machine for actually getting things figuring things out and getting things to happen did he think of
01:29:02 it because essentially what you used you did with the company I don't know if you were thinking of it that way but you're
01:29:10 creating tools to empower your to empower the exploration of the university do you think did he did he
01:29:17 understand that point that the point of tools of I think not as well as he might have done I mean I think that but you
01:29:24 know he was actually my first company which was also involved with well was involved with more mathematical
01:29:33 computation kinds of things you know he was quite - he had lots of advice about the technical side of what we
01:29:40 should do and so on giving examples and memories of thoughts that oh yeah yeah he had all kinds of lucky in in the
01:29:47 business of doing sort of you know one of the hard things in math is doing integrals and so on right and so he had
01:29:53 his own elaborate ways to do integrals and so on he had his own ways of thinking about sort of getting intuition
01:29:59 about how math works and so his sort of meta idea was take those intuitional methods and make a computer follow those
01:30:07 in traditional methods now it turns out for the most part like when we do integrals and things what we do is is we
01:30:14 build this kind of bizarre industrial machine that turns every integral until you know products of Mayer G functions
01:30:21 and generates this very elaborate thing and actually the big problem is turning the results into something a human will
01:30:26 understand it's not quotes doing the integral and actually Fineman did understand that to some extent and I I
01:30:33 am embarrassed to say he once gave me this big pile of you know calculational methods for particle physics that he
01:30:38 worked out in the 50s and he said you know it's more used to you than to me type thing and I I was like I were
01:30:43 intended to look at it and give it back and I store my files now so it's but that's what happens when when it's
01:30:51 finiteness of human lives it I hate you know maybe if he'd live another 20 years I would have I would remember to
01:30:57 give it back but I think it's you know that that was his attempt to systematize the ways that one does integrals that
01:31:05 show up in particle physics and so on turns out the way we've actually done it is very different from that way what do
01:31:11 you make of that difference between so fireman was actually quite remarkable at creating sort of intuitive like diving
01:31:19 in you know creating intuitive frameworks for understanding difficult concepts is I'm smiling because you know
01:31:27 the funny thing about him was that the thing he was really really really good at is calculating stuff and but he
01:31:34 thought that was easy because he was really good at it and so he would do these things where he would calculate
01:31:41 some do some complicated calculation in quantum field theory for example come out with a result wouldn't tell
01:31:46 everybody about the complicated calculation because thought that was easy he thought the really impressive thing
01:31:51 was to have this simple intuition about how everything worse so he invented that at the end and you know because he'd
01:31:58 done this calculation and knew what how it worked it was a lot easier it's a lot easier to have good intuition when you
01:32:05 know what the answer is and then and then he would just not tell anybody about these calculations he wasn't
01:32:10 meaning that maliciously so to speak is just he thought that was easy yeah and and that's you know that led
01:32:16 to areas where people were just completely mystified and they kind of followed his intuition but nobody could
01:32:22 tell why it worked because actually the reason it worked was because he done all these calculations and he knew that it
01:32:26 was would work and you know when I pee and I worked a bit on quantum computers actually back in 1980-81 but before
01:32:34 anybody had heard of those things and you know the typical mode of I mean he always used to say and I now think
01:32:41 about this because I'm about the age that he was when I worked with him and you know I see that people have 1/3 my
01:32:48 age so to speak and oh he was always complaining that I was one-third his age and so for various things but but you
01:32:57 know he would do some calculation by by hand you know blackboard and things come up with some answer I'd say I don't
01:33:03 understand this you know I do something with a computer and he'd say you know I don't understand this so it'd be some
01:33:11 big argument about what was you know what was going on but that it was always some and I think actually we many of the
01:33:19 things that we sort of realized about quantum computing that were sort of issues that have to do particularly with
01:33:25 the measurement process are kind of still issues today and I kind of find it interesting it's a funny thing in
01:33:32 science that these you know that there's there's a remarkable happens in technology too there's a remarkable sort
01:33:38 of repetition of history that ends up occurring eventually things really get nailed down but it often takes a while
01:33:45 and it often things come back decades later well for example I could tell a story actually happened right down the
01:33:53 street from here I will move both that thinking machines I had been working on this particular cellular
01:34:00 automaton will rule 30 that has this feature that it from very simple initial conditions it makes really complicated
01:34:05 behavior okay so and actually of all silly physical things using this big parallel computer
01:34:15 called a connection machine that that company was making I generated this giant printout of rule 30 on very I'm
01:34:22 actually on the same kind of same kind of printer that people use to make layouts for microprocessors so one of
01:34:32 these big you know large format printers with high resolution and so on so okay so print this out lots of very tiny
01:34:39 cells and so there was sort of a question of how some features of that pattern and so it was very much a
01:34:47 physical you know on the floor with meter rules trying to measure different things so so Feynman kind of takes me
01:34:54 aside we've been doing that for a little while and takes me aside he says I just want to know this one thing he says I
01:35:00 want to know how did you know that this rule 30 thing would produce all this really complicated behavior that is so
01:35:07 complicated that weird you know going around this big printout and so on and I said well I didn't know I just
01:35:13 enumerated all the possible rules and then observed that that's what happened he said ah I feel a lot better you know
01:35:21 I thought you had some intuition that he didn't have that would let why I said no no no intuition just experimental
01:35:27 science so that's such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there of that's exactly showed is you really
01:35:35 can't have an intuition about an irreducible I mean you have to run us yes that's right
01:35:39 that's so hard for us humans and especially brilliant physicist like fireman to say that you can't haven't
01:35:50 compressed clean intuition about how the whole thing yes works yes no he was I mean I think he was sort of on the edge
01:35:57 of understanding that point about computation and I think he found that I think he always found computation
01:36:03 interesting and I think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at I mean yeah that intuition you know the
01:36:10 difficulty of discovering things like even you say oh you know you just didn't write all the cases in just find one
01:36:15 that does something interesting right sounds very easy turns out like I missed it when I first saw it because I had
01:36:22 kind of an intuition that said it shouldn't be there and so I had kind of arguments oh I'm gonna ignore that case
01:36:29 because whatever and so how did you have an open mind enough because you're essentially the same person is just your
01:36:34 fight like for the same kind of physics type of thinking how did you find yourself having a sufficiently open mind
01:36:43 to be open to watching rules and them revealing complexity yeah I think that's an interesting question I've wondered
01:36:48 about that myself because it's kind of like you know you live through these things and then you say what was the
01:36:53 historical story and sometimes the historical story that you realized after the fact was not what you lived through
01:37:00 so to speak and so you know what I realized is I think what happened is you know I did physics kind of like
01:37:09 reductionistic physics where you're throw-in the universe and you have tells go figure out what's going on inside it
01:37:15 and then I started building computer tools and I started building my first computer language for example and
01:37:21 computer language is not like it's sort of like physics in the sense that you have to take all those computations
01:37:26 people want to do and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they can all be made of but then you do something
01:37:32 that's really different because you just you're just saying okay these are the primitives now you know hopefully
01:37:38 they'll be useful to people let's build up from there so you're essentially building an
01:37:43 show universe in a sense where you make this language you've got these primitives you're just building whatever
01:37:50 you feel like building and that's and so it was sort of interesting for me because from doing science where you
01:37:54 just throw in the universe as the universe is to then just being told you know you can make up any universe you
01:38:02 want and so I think that experience of of making a computer language which is essentially building your own universe
01:38:09 so to speak is you know that's kind of the that's that's what gave me a somewhat different attitude towards what
01:38:16 might be possible it's like let's just explore what can be done in these artificial universes rather than
01:38:22 thinking the natural science way of let's be constrained by how the universe actually is yeah by being able to
01:38:29 program essentially you've as opposed to being limited to just your mind and a pen you you now have you've basically
01:38:36 built another brain that you can use to explore the universe but yeah computer program you know this is kind of a brain
01:38:42 right and it's well it's it's or telescope or you know it's a tool and it lets you see stuff but there's something
01:38:48 fundamentally different between a computer and a telescope I mean it just yeah I'm Amanda sighs the notion but
01:38:58 it's more general and it's it's I think I mean this point about you know people say oh such and such a thing was almost
01:39:08 discovered at such and such a time the the distance between you know the building the paradigm that allows you to
01:39:14 actually understand stuff or allows one to be open to seeing what's going on that's really hard and you know I think
01:39:22 in I've been fortunate in my life that I spent a lot of my time building computational language and that's an
01:39:31 activity that in a sense works by sort of having to kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be open
01:39:39 to different kinds of structures but you know it's it's always some I mean I'm fully aware of I suppose the fact that I
01:39:47 have seen it a bunch of times of how easy it is to miss the obvious so to speak that at least is factored into my
01:39:54 attempt to not miss the obvious although it may not succeed what do you think is the role of ego in the history
01:40:07 of math and science and more sort of you know a book title is something like a new kind of science you've accomplished
01:40:15 a huge amount in fact somebody said that Newton didn't have an ego and I looked into it and he had a huge ego yeah but
01:40:23 from an outsider's perspective some have said that you have a bit of an ego as well do you see it that way does ego get
01:40:31 in the way is it empowering is it both so it's it's it's all implicated necessary I mean you know I've had look
01:40:38 I've spent more than half my life CEO in a tech company right ok and you know that is a I think it's
01:40:49 actually very it means that one's ego is not a distant thing it's the thing that one encounters every day so to speak
01:40:55 because it's it's all tied up with leadership and with how one you know develops an organization and all these
01:41:01 kinds of things so you know it may be that if I've been an academic for example I could have sort of you know
01:41:07 check the ego put it on put on a shelf somewhere and ignored its characteristics but for your reminder it
01:41:14 quite often in the context of running a company sure yeah I mean that's what it's about it's it's about leadership
01:41:21 and you know leadership is intimately tied to ego now what does it mean I mean what what is the you know for me I've
01:41:28 been fortunate that I think I have reasonable intellectual confidence so to speak that is you know I I'm one of
01:41:36 these people who at this point if somebody tells me something and I just don't understand it my conclusion isn't
01:41:44 that means I'm dumb that my conclusion is there's something wrong with what I'm being told and that was actually dick
01:41:50 Feynman used to have that that that feature - he never really believed it he actually believed in experts much less
01:41:58 than I believe in experts so Wow so that's a fun that's a that's a fundamentally powerful property of ego
01:42:07 and saying like not that I am wrong but that the the world is wrong and telling me like when confronted with the
01:42:14 fact that doesn't fit the thing that you've really thought through sort of both the negative and the positive of
01:42:22 ego you see the negative of that get in the way sort of be sure the Fronteras mistakes I've made that are the results
01:42:30 of I'm pretty sure I'm right and turns out I'm not I mean that's that's the you know but but the thing is that the the
01:42:38 the idea that one tries to do things that so for example you know one question is if people have tried hard to
01:42:46 do something and then one thinks maybe I should try doing this myself if one does not have a certain degree of
01:42:52 intellectual confidence one just says well people have been trying to do this for a hundred years how am I going to be
01:42:57 able to do this yeah and you know I was fortunate in the sense that I happen to start having some degree of success in
01:43:03 science and things when I was really young and so that developed a certain amounts of sort of intellectual
01:43:08 confidence I don't think I otherwise would have had and you know in a sense I mean I was fortunate that I was
01:43:15 working in the field particle physics during it sort of Golden Age of rapid progress and that that's kind of good on
01:43:22 a false sense of achievement because it's kind of kind of easy to discover stuff that's gonna survive if you happen
01:43:27 to be you know picking the low-hanging fruit of a rapidly expanding field I mean the reason I totally I totally
01:43:34 immediately understood the ego behind a new kind of science to me let me sort of just try to express my feelings and the
01:43:42 whole thing is that if you don't allow that kind of ego then you would never write that book that you would say well
01:43:49 people must have done this there's not you would not dig you would not keep digging and I think that was I think you
01:43:58 have to take that ego and ride it and see where it takes you in that and that's how you create exceptional work I
01:44:05 think the other point about that book was it was a non-trivial question how to take a bunch of ideas that 
01:44:12 I think reasonably big ideas they might you know their importance is determined by what happens historically one can't
01:44:18 tell how important they are one can tell sort of the scope of them and the scope is fairly big and they're
01:44:25 very different from things that have come before and the question is how do you explain that stuff to people and so
01:44:31 I had had the experience of sort of saying well there these things does a cellular automaton it does this it does
01:44:37 that and people are like oh it must be just like this it must be just like that say no it isn't it's something different
01:44:44 right I said I could have done sort of I'm really glad you did what you did but you could have done a sort of
01:44:48 academically just publish keep publishing small papers here and there and then you would just keep getting
01:44:53 this kind of resistance right you would get like yeah it's supposed to just dropping a thing that says here it is
01:45:00 yeah here's like full the full thing no I mean that was my calculation is that basically you know you could introduce
01:45:06 little pieces it's like you know one possibility is like it's it's the secret weapon so to speak it's this you know I
01:45:12 keep on an intraday you know discovering these things in all these different areas where'd they come from
01:45:17 nobody knows but I decided that you know in the interests of one only has one life to lead and you know it the writing
01:45:24 that book took me a decade anyway it's not there's not a lot of wiggle room so to speak one can't be wrong by a factor
01:45:29 of three he said is peeking how long it's going to take that I you know I thought the best thing to do the thing
01:45:38 that is most sort of that most respects the the intellectual content so to speak is you just put it out with as much
01:45:46 force as you can because it's not something where and you know it's an interesting thing you talk about ego and
01:45:52 it's it's you know for example I run a company which has my name on it right I I thought about starting a club people
01:45:59 whose companies have their names on them and it's it's a funny group because we're not a bunch of ego maniacs that's
01:46:05 not what it's about so to speak it's about basically sort of taking responsibility for what one's doing and
01:46:13 you know in a sense any of these things where you're sort of putting yourself on the line it's it's kind of a funny it's
01:46:24 a funny dynamic because in a sense my company is sort of something that happens to have my name on it but it's
01:46:29 kind of bigger than me and I'm kind of just its mascot at some level I mean I also happen to be a pretty
01:46:37 you know strong leader of it but but it's basically showing a deep inextricable sort of investment the same
01:46:47 your name like Steve Jobs his name wasn't on Apple but he was Apple yes Elon Musk's name is not on Tesla but he
01:46:58 is Tesla so it's like a meaning emotionally his company succeeds or fails he would just that emotionally
01:47:06 would suffer through that and so that's that's did recognizing that fact tonight and also wolf form is a pretty good
01:47:14 branding name so that works up I think Steve had it had a bad deal there yeah so you you've made up for it with the
01:47:23 last name okay so so in 2002 you published a new kind of science to which sort of on a personal level I can credit
01:47:31 my love for cellular automata and computation in general I think a lot of others can as well can you briefly
01:47:42 describe the vision the hope the main idea presented in this twelve hundred page book sure although it took twelve
01:47:51 hundred pages to say in the book so know that the the real idea it's kind of a good way to get into it is to look at
01:47:58 sort of the arc of history and to look at what's happened in kind of the developments of science I mean there was
01:48:04 this sort of big idea in science about three hundred years ago that was let's use mathematical equations to try and
01:48:11 describe things in the world let's use sort of the formal idea of mathematical equations to describe what might be
01:48:17 happening in the world rather than for example just using sort of logical augmentation and so on let's have a a
01:48:24 formal theory about that and so they've been this three hundred year run of using mathematical equations to describe
01:48:28 the natural world which would work pretty well but I got interested in how one could generalize that notion you
01:48:36 know there is a formal theory there are definite rules but what structure could those rules have and so what I got
01:48:43 interested in was let's generalize beyond the sort of purely mathematical rules and we now have this sort of
01:48:49 ocean of programming and computing and so on let's use the kinds of rules that can be embodied in programs to has a
01:48:57 sort of generalization of the ones that can exist in mathematics as a way to describe the world and so my kind of
01:49:05 favorite version of these kinds of simple rules are these things called cellular automata and so typical case
01:49:14 shall we what are cellular automata fair enough so typical case of a cellular automaton it's an array of cells it's
01:49:23 just a line of discrete cells each cell is either black or white and in a series of steps you can represent as lines
01:49:31 going down a page you're updating the color of each cell according to a rule that depends on the color of the cell
01:49:37 above it and to its left and right so it's really simple so a thing might be you know if the cell on its right
01:49:50 neighbor are not the same and or the cell on the left is is is black or something then make it back on the next
01:49:58 step and if not make it white typical rule that rule I'm not sure I said it exactly right but a rule very much like
01:50:05 what I just said has the feature that if you started off from just one black cell at the top it makes this extremely
01:50:12 complicated pattern so some rules you get a very simple pattern some rules you have the rule is simple you start them
01:50:21 off from a sort of simple seed you just get this very simple pattern but other rules and this was the big surprise when
01:50:28 I started actually just doing the simple computer experiments to find out what happens is that they produce very
01:50:34 complicated patterns of behavior so for example its rule 30 rule has the feature you start from just one black cell at
01:50:42 the top makes this very random pattern if you look like at the center column of cells you get a series of values you
01:50:50 know it goes back white black black whatever it is that sequence seems for all practical purposes random so it's
01:50:59 kind of like in in math you know you can put the digits of pi 3 one four one five nine two six whatever
01:51:06 those digits once computed I mean that the scheme for computing pi you know it's the ratio of the circumference to
01:51:10 the diameter of a circle very well-defined but yet when you are once you've generated those digits they seem
01:51:17 for all practical purposes completely random and so it is with rule 30 that even though the rule is very simple much
01:51:25 simpler much more sort of computationally obvious than the rule for generating digits of pi even with a
01:51:32 rule that simple you're still generating immensely complicated behavior yeah so if we could just pause on that I think
01:51:38 you you probably said it and looked at it so long you forgot the magic of it or perhaps you know you still feel the
01:51:45 magic but to me if you've never seen sort of I would say what is it a one dimensional essentially another automata
01:51:54 right and and you were to guess what you would see if you have some so cells that only respond to its neighbors right if
01:52:06 you were to guess what kind of things you would see like my my initial guess like even when I first like open your
01:52:14 book a new kind of science right - your guess is you would see I mean it would be a very simple stuff like and I think
01:52:23 it's a magical experience to realize the kind of complex you mentioned rule 30 still your favorite cellular automaton
01:52:32 oh my favorite rule yes it you get complexity immense complexity you get arbitrary complexity yes and when you
01:52:39 say randomness down the middle column you know that's just what one cool way to say that there's incredible
01:52:49 complexity and that's just the gist I mean that's a magical idea however you start to interpret it all the
01:52:54 reducibility discussions all that but it's just I think that has profound philosophical kind of notions around it
01:53:03 - it's not just well you know I mean this transformation about how you see the world I think for me was
01:53:08 transformational I don't know we can what it can have all kinds of discussion about computation and so on but just you
01:53:14 know I and sometimes think if I were on a desert island and was I don't know maybe
01:53:22 it was some psychedelics or something but if I had to take one book any new kind of science would be a because you
01:53:29 just enjoy that notion for some reason it's a deeply profound notion at least to me I find it that way yeah I mean
01:53:37 look it's been it was a very intuition breaking thing to discover I mean it's kind of like you know you you point the
01:53:45 computational telescope out there and suddenly you see I don't know you know in the past it's kind of like you know
01:53:51 moons of Jupiter or something but suddenly you see something that's kind of very unexpected and rule 30 was very
01:53:57 unexpected for me and the big challenge at a personal level was to not ignore it I mean people you know in other words
01:54:06 you might say you know it's a bug what would you say yeah well yeah I mean I I what are we looking at by the way well I
01:54:11 was just generating Herald actually generated a rule 30 pattern so that's the rule for for rule 30 and it says for
01:54:19 example it says here if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the right then
01:54:24 the cell on the next step will be white and so here's the actual pattern that you get starting off from a single black
01:54:33 cell at the top there and then that's the initial state initial condition that's the initial thing you just start
01:54:37 off from that and then you're going down the page and at every at every step you're just applying this rule to find
01:54:45 out the new value that you get and so you might think rule that simple you got to get that there's got to be some trace
01:54:52 of that simplicity here okay we'll run it let's say for 400 steps what it does it's kind of really asking a bit on
01:54:59 the screen there but but you can see there's a little bit of regularity over on the left but there's a lot of stuff
01:55:06 here that just looks very complicated very random and that's a big sort of shock to was a big shock to my intuition
01:55:16 at least that that's possible your mind immediately starts is there a pattern there must be a repetitive pattern yeah
01:55:21 there must be as well the rhein so I spent so indeed that's what I thought at first and I thought I thought well this
01:55:27 is kind of interesting but you know if we long enough we'll see you know something will resolve into something simple and
01:55:35 you know I did all kinds of analysis of using mathematics statistics cryptography whatever whatever to try
01:55:43 and crack it and I never succeeded and after I hadn't succeeded for awhile I started thinking maybe there's a real
01:55:49 phenomenon here that is the reason I'm not succeeding maybe I mean the thing that for me was sort of a motivating
01:55:56 factor was looking at the natural world and seeing all this complexity that exists in the natural world the question
01:56:00 is where does it come from you know what secret does nature have that lets it make all this complexity
01:56:06 that we humans when we engineer things typically are not making we're typically making things that at least look quite
01:56:14 simple to us and so the shock here was even from something very simple you're making something that complex maybe this
01:56:21 is getting at sort of the secret that nature has that allows it to make really complex things even though its
01:56:29 underlying rules may not be that complex how did it make you feel if we if we look at the Newton Apple was there was
01:56:36 it was there you know you took a walk and in something it profoundly hit you or was this a gradual thing a lot of
01:56:46 truth the truth of every sort of science discovery is it's not that gradual I mean I've spent I happen to be
01:56:52 interested in scientific biography kinds of things and so I've tried to track down you know how did people come to
01:56:57 figure out this or that thing and there's always a long kind of sort of preparatory you know there's a there's a
01:57:07 need to be prepared in a mindset in which it's possible to see something I mean in the case of rule 30 our eyes
01:57:14 around June 1st 1984 was some kind of a silly story in some ways I finally had a high-resolution laser printer so I was
01:57:20 able so I thought I'm gonna generate a bunch of pictures of these cellular automata and I generate this one and I
01:57:27 put it on some plane flight for to Europe you know have this with me and it's like you know I really should try
01:57:34 to understand this and this is really you know this is I really don't understand what's going on and that was
01:57:41 kind of the you know slowly trying to trying to see what was happening as it was not it was depressingly uncertain so
01:57:50 to speak in the sense that a lot of these ideas like principle of computational equivalence for example
01:57:56 you know I thought well that's a possible thing I didn't know if it's correct still don't know for sure that
01:58:02 it's correct but it's sort of a gradual thing that these things gradually kind of become seem more important than one
01:58:09 thought I mean I think the whole idea of studying the computational universe of simple programs it took me probably a
01:58:17 decade decade and a half to kind of internalize that that was really an important idea and I think you know
01:58:24 if it turns out we find the whole universe looking out there in the computational universe that's a good you
01:58:29 know it's a good brownie point or something for the for the whole idea but I think that the the thing that strange
01:58:37 in this whole question about you know finding this different raw material for making models of things what's been
01:58:43 interesting sort of in the in sort of arc of history is you know for 300 years it's kind of like the the mathematical
01:58:50 equations approach it was the winner it was the thing you know you want to have a really a good model for something
01:58:55 that's what you use the thing that's been remarkable is just in the last decade or so I think one can see a
01:59:03 transition to using not mathematical equations but programs as sort of the raw material for making models of stuff
01:59:10 and that's pretty neat and it's kind of you know as somebody who's kind of lived inside this paradigm shift so to speak
01:59:19 it is bizarre I mean no doubt instead of the history of science that will be seen as an instantaneous paradigm shift but
01:59:24 it sure isn't instantaneous when it's played out in one's actual life so to speak try
01:59:30 it seems glacial and and it's the kind of thing where where it's sort of interesting because in the dynamics of
01:59:38 sort of the adoption of ideas like that into different fields the younger the field the faster the adoption typically
01:59:46 because people are not kind of locked in with the fifth generation of people who've studied this field and it is it
01:59:52 is the way it is and it can never be any different and I think that's been you know watching that process has been
01:59:59 interesting I mean I'm I'm I think I'm fortunate that I I've I I do stuff mainly because I like doing it and if I
02:00:09 was some that makes me kind of thick-skinned about the world's response to what I do and but that's
02:00:16 definitely you know and anytime you you write a book called something like a new kind of science it's kind of the the
02:00:24 pitchforks will come out for the for the old kind of science and I was was interesting dynamics I think that the I
02:00:32 I have to say that I was fully aware of the fact that the when you see sort of incipient paradigm shifts in science the
02:00:41 vigor of the negative response upon early introduction is a fantastic positive indicator of good long-term
02:00:50 results so in other words if people just don't care it's you know that's not such a good sign if they're like oh this
02:00:57 is great that means you didn't really discover anything interesting what fascinating properties of rule 30 have
02:01:05 you discovered over the years you've recently announced the rule 30 prizes for solving three key problems can you
02:01:12 maybe talk about interesting properties that have been kind of revealed rule 30 or other cellular automata and what
02:01:20 problems are still before us like the three problems you've announced yeah yeah right so I mean the most
02:01:26 interesting thing about cellular automata is that it's hard to figure stuff out about them and that's some in
02:01:34 a sense every time you try and sort of you try and bash them with some other technique you say can i crack them the
02:01:41 answer is they seem to be uncrackable they seem to have the feature that they are that they're sort of showing
02:01:49 irreducible computation they're not you're not able to say oh I know exactly what this is going to do it's going to
02:01:56 do this or that but there's a specific formulations of that fact yes right so I mean for example in in rule 30 in the
02:02:03 pattern you get just starting from a single black cell you get this sort of very very sort of random
02:02:11 pattern and so one feature of that just look at the center column and for example we used that for a long time to
02:02:17 generate random the symbol from language just you know what rule 30 produces now the question is can you prove how
02:02:25 random it is so for example one very simple question can you prove that and never repeat nope we haven't been able
02:02:32 to show that will never repeat we know that if there are two adjacent columns we know they can't both repeat
02:02:39 but just knowing whether that center column can ever repeat we still don't even know that another problem that
02:02:46 I've sort of put in my collection of you know it's like $30,000 for three you know for these three prizes for about
02:02:54 rule thirty I would say this is not one of those is one of those cases where the money is not the main point but it's
02:03:03 just you know helps some motivate somehow that the investigation so there's three problems you propose you
02:03:09 get thirty thousand dollars if you solve all three or maybe yeah no it's ten thousand for each for each a my the
02:03:15 problems that's right money's not the thing the problems themselves are just clean yeah right it's just you know will
02:03:23 it ever become periodic second problem is other an equal number of black and white cells down the middle calm down
02:03:28 the middle column and the third problem is a little bit harder to state which is essentially is there a way of figuring
02:03:35 out what the color of a cell at position T down the center column is in a with a less computational effort than about T
02:03:44 steps so in other words is there way to jump ahead and say I know what this is gonna do you know it's just some
02:03:53 mathematical function of T or proving that there is no way or proving there is no way yes but both I mean you know for
02:04:00 any one of these one could prove that you know one could discover you know we know what rule thirty does for a billion
02:04:06 steps but and maybe we'll know for a trillion steps before two very long but maybe at a quadrillion steps it suddenly
02:04:13 becomes repetitive you might say how could that possibly happen but so when I was writing up these prizes I thought
02:04:19 and this is typical of what happens in the computational universe I thought let me find an example where it looks like
02:04:25 it's just gonna be random forever but actually it becomes repetitive yeah and I found one and it's just you know I did
02:04:31 a search I searched I don't know maybe a million different rules with some criterion and this is what's sort of
02:04:39 interesting about that is I kind of have this thing that I per se got a silly way about the computational universe which
02:04:45 is you know the animals are always smarter than you that is there's always some way one of
02:04:49 these computational systems is gonna figure out how to do something even though I can't imagine how its gonna do
02:04:54 it and you know I didn't think I would find one that you know you would think of for all these years that what I found
02:05:02 sort of all possible things funky things that that I would have that I would have gotten my intuition wrapped around the
02:05:11 idea that you know these creatures are always in the computational universe are always smarter than I'm gonna be but you
02:05:16 know they're equivalently yes Mari that's correct and that makes it that makes one feel very sort of it's it's
02:05:24 it's humbling every time because every time the thing is is you know you think it's gonna do this so it's not gonna be
02:05:30 possible to do this and it turns out it finds a way of course the promising thing is there's a lot of other rules
02:05:34 like rule 30 it's just rule 30 is oh it's my favorite because I found it first and that's
02:05:42 right but the problems are focusing on rule 30 it's possible that rule 30 is is repetitive after trillion steps and that
02:05:50 doesn't prove anything about the other rules it does not but this is a good sort of experiment of how you go about
02:05:56 trying to prove something about a stick you'll rule yes and it also all these things help build intuition that is
02:06:02 intact if it turned out that this was repetitive tore trillion steps that's not what I would expect and so we
02:06:09 learned something from that the method to do that though would reveal something interesting about the so no doubt no doubt
02:06:17 I mean it's although it's sometimes challenging like the you know I put out a prize in 2007 for for a particular
02:06:26 Turing machine that I there was the simplest candidate for being the universal Turing machine and the young
02:06:33 chap in England named Alex Smith after a smallish number of months said I've got a proof and he did you know I took a
02:06:39 little while to iterate but you had a proof unfortunately the proof is very it's it's a lot of micro details it's
02:06:48 it's not it's not like you look at it you say aha there's a big new principle the big new principle is the simplest
02:06:55 Turing machine that might have been Universal actually is universal and it's incredibly much simpler than the
02:07:00 turning machines that people already knew we universal before that and so that intuition Allah is important
02:07:07 because it says computation universality is closer at home than you might have thought but the actual methods are
02:07:14 not in that particular case were not terribly illuminate happiness if their methods would also be elegant that's true
02:07:20 yeah no I mean I think it's it's one of these things where I mean it's it's like a lot of we've talked about earlier kind
02:07:27 of you know opening up a eyes and machine learning and things of what's going on inside and is it just step by
02:07:33 step or can you sort of see the bigger picture more abstractly and unfortunately with Verma's Last Theorem
02:07:39 proof it's unfortunate that the proof to such an elegant theorem is is not I mean it's as if it's not it doesn't write
02:07:49 into the margins of a page that's true but these know one of the things is that's another consequence of
02:07:54 computational or disability this this fact that there are even quite short results in mathematics whose proofs
02:08:02 arbitrarily long yes that's a that's a consequence of all this stuff and it's it's a it makes one wonder you know how
02:08:09 come mathematics is possible at all why is you know why is it the case how people manage to navigate doing
02:08:16 mathematics through looking at things where they're not just throwing into it's all undecidable that's that's its
02:08:24 own own separate separate story and that would be that would they would have a poetic beauty to it as if people were to
02:08:32 find something interesting about rule 30 because I mean there's an emphasis to this particular rule it wouldn't say
02:08:39 anything about the broad irreducibility of all computations but it would nevertheless put a few smiles on
02:08:46 people's faces of well yeah yeah but to me it's like in a sense establishing principle of computational equivalence
02:08:54 it's a little bit like doing inductive science anywhere that is the more examples you find the more convinced you
02:09:01 are that it's generally true I mean we don't get to you know whenever we do natural science we we say well it's true
02:09:09 here that this will that happens can we can we prove that it's true everywhere in the universe no we can't
02:09:15 so you know it's the same thing here we're exploring the computational universe we're establishing facts in the
02:09:21 computational universe and that's that's sort of a way of of inductively concluding general things just to think
02:09:32 through this a little bit we've touched on it a little bit before but what's the difference between the kind of
02:09:38 computation now that we're talking about cellular automata what's the difference between the kind of computation
02:09:44 biological systems our mind our bodies the things we see before us that emerged through the process of evolution and
02:09:53 cellular automata deep I mean we've kind of applied to the discussion of physics underlying
02:09:59 everything but we we talked about the potential equivalents of the fundamental laws of physics and the kind of
02:10:12 interesting about the kind of computation that our bodies do right well let's talk about brains primary
02:10:21 range the the I mean I think the the most important thing about the things that our brains do that we care about
02:10:27 them in the sense that there's a lot of computation going on out there in you know cellular automata and and you know
02:10:34 physical systems and so on and it just it does what it does it follows those rules it does what it does
02:10:39 the thing that's special about the computation in our brains is that it's connected to our goals and our current
02:10:47 whole societal story and you know I think that's the that's that's the special feature and now the question
02:10:53 then is when you see this whole sort of ocean of computation out there how do you connect that to the things that we
02:11:00 humans care about and in a sense a large part of my life has been involved in sort of the technology of how to do that
02:11:06 and you know what I've been interested in is kind of building computational language that allows that something that
02:11:13 both we humans can understand and that can be used to determine computations that are actually computations we care
02:11:20 about see I think when you look at something like one of these cellular automata and it does some complicated
02:11:25 thing you say that's fun but why do I care well you could say the same thing actually in
02:11:32 physics you say oh I've got this material and it's a ferrite or something why do I care you know it's some has
02:11:38 some magnetic properties why do I care it's amusing but why do I care well we end up caring because you know
02:11:44 ferrite is what's used to make magnetic tape magnetic disks whatever or you know we could use the coke crystals as made
02:11:51 used to make well not that she increasingly not but it has been used to make computer displays and so on but
02:11:57 those are so in a sense where mining these things that happen to exist in the physical universe and I'm making it be
02:12:04 something that we care about because we sort of in train it into technology and it's the same thing in the computational
02:12:10 universe that a lot of what's out there is stuff that's just happening but sometimes we have some objective and we
02:12:18 will go and sort of mine the computational universe for something that's useful for some particular
02:12:24 objective on a large scale trying to do that trying to sort of navigate the computational universe to do useful
02:12:29 things you know that's where computational language comes in and you know a lot of what I've spent time doing
02:12:36 and building this thing we call Wolfram language which I've been building for the last one third of a century now and
02:12:46 kind of the goal there is to have a way to express kind of computational thinking computational thoughts in a way
02:12:53 that both humans and machines can understand so it's kind of like in the tradition of computer languages
02:13:00 programming languages that the tradition there has been more let's take what how computers are built and let's specify
02:13:09 let's have a human way to specify do this do this do this at the level of the way that computers are built what I've
02:13:15 been interested in is representing sort of the whole world computationally and being able to talk about whether it's
02:13:22 about cities or chemicals or you know this kind of algorithm or that kind of algorithm things that have come to exist
02:13:28 in our civilization and the sort of knowledge base of our civilization being able to talk directly about those in a
02:13:35 computational language so that both we can understand it and computers can understand I mean the thing that I've been sort of
02:13:42 excited about recently which I had only realized recently which is kind of embarrassing but trim is kind of the the
02:13:48 arc of what we've tried to do in building this kind of computational language is it's a similar kind of arc
02:13:55 of what happened when mathematical notation was invented so go back 400 years people were trying to do math they
02:14:03 were always explaining their math in words and it was pretty conky and as soon as mathematical notation was
02:14:11 invented you could start defining things like algebra and later calculus and so on it all became much more streamlined
02:14:17 when we deal with computational thinking about the world there's a question of what is the notation what is the what is
02:14:23 the kind of formalism that we can use to talk about the world computationally and in a sense that's what I've spent the
02:14:29 last third of a century trying to build and we finally got to the point where we have a pretty full scale computational
02:14:35 language that sort of talks about the world and that's that's exciting because it means that just like having this
02:14:43 mathematical notation let us talk about the world mathematically we now and and let us built up build up these kind of
02:14:51 mathematical sciences now we have a computational language which allows us to start talking about the world
02:14:57 computationally and lets us you know my view of it is it's kind of computational X for all X all these different fields
02:15:04 of you know computational this computational that that's what we can now build let's step back so first of
02:15:10 all the mundane what is Wolfram language in terms of sort of I mean I can answer the question
02:15:20 for you but this it basically not the philosophical deep to profound the impact of it I'm talking about in terms
02:15:26 of tools in terms of things you can download and yeah you can play with what is it what what does it fit into the
02:15:31 infrastructure what are the different ways to interact with it right so I mean that the two big things that people have
02:15:38 sort of perhaps heard of that come from open language one is Mathematica the other is Wolfram Alpha so Mathematica
02:15:45 first came out 1988 it's this system that is basically a instance of Wolfram language and it's used to do
02:15:54 computations particularly in sort of technical areas and the typical thing you're doing is you're you're typing
02:16:01 little pieces of computational language and you're getting computations done it's very kind of there's like as
02:16:10 symbolic yeah it's a symbolic language so symbolic language took any I don't know how to cleanly express that but
02:16:16 that makes a very distinct from what how we think about sort of I don't know programming in a Ling like Python or
02:16:22 something right but so so the point is that in a traditional programming language the raw material of the
02:16:28 programming language it's just stuff that computers intrinsically do and the point of often language is that what the
02:16:37 language is talking about is things that exist in the world or things that we can imagine and construct not it's not it's
02:16:45 not sort of it's it's aimed to be an abstract language from the beginning and so for example one feature it has is
02:16:50 that it's a symbolic language which means that you know you the thing called you have an X just type in X and what
02:16:58 why would you just say oh that's X it won't say error undefined thing you know I don't know what it is computation you
02:17:05 know but in terms of the in terms of computer now that X could perfectly well be you know the city of Boston that's a
02:17:13 thing that's a symbolic thing or it could perfectly well be the you know the trajectory of some spacecraft
02:17:20 represented as a symbolic thing and that idea that one can work with sort of computationally work with these
02:17:28 different these kinds of things that that exist in the world or describe the world that's really powerful and that's
02:17:35 what some I mean you know when I started designing well I designed the predecessor of what's now often language
02:17:42 was a thing called SMP which was my first computer language I am I kind of wanted to have this the sort of
02:17:50 infrastructure for computation which was as fundamental as possible I mean this is what I got for having bit of
02:17:56 physicists and tried to find you know fundamental components of things and wound up with this kind of idea of
02:18:03 transformation rules for symbolic expressions as being sort of the underlying stuff from which computation would be
02:18:10 built and that's what we've been building from in Wolfram language and you know operationally what happens it's
02:18:19 I would say by far the highest level computer language that exists and its really been built in a very different
02:18:27 direction from other languages so other languages have been about there is a lot core language
02:18:33 it really is kind of wrapped around the operations that a computer intrinsically does maybe people add libraries for this
02:18:40 or that that but the goal of Wolfram language is to have the language itself be able to cover this sort of very broad
02:18:47 range of things that show up in the world and that means that you know there are 6,000 primitive functions in the
02:18:54 Wolfram language that cover things you know I could probably pick a a random here I'm gonna pick just because just
02:19:01 for fun I'll pick them let's take a random sample of them of all the things that we have here so let's just say
02:19:10 random sample of 10 of them and let's see what we get Wow okay so these are really different things from functions
02:19:19 these are all functions boolean converts okay that's the thing for converting between different types of boolean
02:19:25 expressions so for people are just listening human type 10 random sample names sampling from all functionally how
02:19:32 many you said there might six thousand six thousand six thousand ten of them and there's a hilarious variety of them
02:19:39 yeah right well we've got things about some dollar requests or a dress that has to do with interacting with the the
02:19:47 world of the of the cloud and so on discrete wavelet data it's for ROI a graphical sort of window yeah yeah
02:19:54 window moveable that's the user interface kind of thing I want to pick another 10 cuz I think this is some okay
02:20:00 so yeah there's a lot of infrastructure stuff here that you see if you if you just start sampling at random there's a
02:20:05 lot of kind of infrastructural things if you're more you know if you more look at the some of the exciting machine
02:20:10 learning stuff is shut off is that also in this pool oh yeah yeah I mean you know so one of those functions is like
02:20:17 image identify as a function here where you just say image identified was good too let's do this let's say
02:20:24 current image and let's pick up an image hopefully just a current image accessing the webcam took a picture yourself
02:20:36 anyway we can say image identify open square brackets and then we just paste that picture in there imagine if I
02:20:42 function running come to picture lo and it says oh wow it says I look I look like a plunger because I got this great
02:20:48 big thing behind me classify so this image identify classifies the most likely object in in the image in it so
02:20:55 there's a wonder okay that's that that's a bit embarrassing let's see what it does let's pick the top 10 okay well
02:21:01 it thinks there's oh it thinks it's pretty unlikely that it's a primary two hominid two plus eight percent
02:21:07 probability yeah that's that's five seven it's a plunger yeah well so if we will not give you an existential crisis
02:21:15 and then  eight percent or not I should say percent but no that's a scent that it's a hominid and yeah okay
02:21:22 it's really I'm gonna do another one of these just because I'm embarrassed that it there we go let's try that let's see
02:21:33 what that did we took a picture a little bit a little bit more of me and not just my bald head so to speak okay
02:21:40 eighty-nine percent problem is it's a person so that there so then I would but you know so this is image identify
02:21:47 as an example of one of just one of them in just one function and that's part of the that's like part of the language yes
02:21:54 so first I mean you know something like I could say I don't know let's find the geo nearest what could we find let's
02:22:04 find the nearest volcano let's find the ten I wonder where it thinks here is let's try finding the ten volcanoes
02:22:15 nearest here okay yo nearest volcano here 10 years volcanoes right let's find out where those oh we can now we got a
02:22:22 list of volcanoes out and I can say geo list plot that and hopefully okay so there we go so there's a map that shows
02:22:30 the positions of those ten volcanoes of the East Coast and the Midway density well no we're okay okay there's
02:22:36 not it's not too bad yeah they're not very close to us we could we could measure how far away they are but you
02:22:42 know the fact that right in the language it knows about all the volcanoes in the world that knows you know computing what
02:22:48 the nearest ones are it knows all the maps of the world and so on a fundamentally different idea what a
02:22:53 language is yeah right that's that's what I like to talk about is you know a full scale computational language that's
02:22:58 that's what we've tried to do and just if you can comment briefly I mean this kind of the Wolfram language along with
02:23:05 Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what the dream of what AI is supposed to be there's now a sort of a craze of
02:23:13 learning kind of idea that we can take raw data and from that extract the the different hierarchies of abstractions
02:23:22 and in order to be able to under the kind of things that well from language operates with but we're very far from
02:23:30 learning systems being able to form that but like the context of history of AI if you could just comment on there is a you
02:23:40 said computation X and there's just some sense where in the 80's and 90's sort of expert systems represented a very
02:23:48 particular computation ax yes right and there's a kind of notion that those efforts didn't pan out right but then
02:23:57 out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language Wolfram Alpha which is the success I mean yeah right I think those
02:24:03 are in some sense those efforts were too modest they're nice they were they were looking at particular areas and you
02:24:09 actually can't do it with a particular area I mean like like even a problem like natural language understanding it's
02:24:14 critical to have broad knowledge of the world if you want to do good natural language understanding and you kind of
02:24:20 have to bite off the whole problem if you if you say we're just gonna do the blocks world over here so to speak
02:24:26 you don't really it's it's it's actually it's one of these cases where it's easier to do the whole thing than it is
02:24:31 to do some piece of it you know what one comment to make about so the relationship between what we've tried to
02:24:38 do and sort of the learning side of AI you know in a sense if you look at the development of knowledge in our
02:24:43 civilization as a whole there was kind of this notion for three hundred years ago or so now you
02:24:48 want to figure something out about the world you can reason it out you can do things which would just use raw human
02:24:55 thought and then along came sort of modern mathematical science and we found ways to just sort of blast through that
02:25:02 by in that case writing down equations now we also know we can do that with computation and so on and so that was
02:25:09 kind of a different thing so when we look at how do we sort of encode knowledge and figure things out one way
02:25:16 we could do it is start from scratch learn everything it's just a neuron that figuring everything out but in a sense
02:25:24 that denies the sort of knowledge-based achievements of our civilization because in our civilization we have learnt lots
02:25:30 of stuff we've surveyed all the volcanoes in the world we've done you know we've figured out lots of
02:25:35 algorithms for this or that those are things that we can encode computationally and that's what we've
02:25:41 tried to do and we're not saying just you don't have to start everything from scratch so in a sense a big part of what
02:25:49 we've done is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the world in computational form in computable form
02:25:56 now there's also some pieces which which were for a long time undoable by computers like image
02:26:02 identification where there's a really really useful module that we can add that is those things which actually were
02:26:09 pretty easy for humans to do that had been hard for computers to do I think the thing that's interesting that's
02:26:14 emerging now is the interplay between these things between this kind of knowledge of the world that is in a
02:26:19 sense very symbolic and this kind of sort of much more statistical kind of things like image identification and so
02:26:29 on and putting those together by having the sort of symbolic representation of image identification that that's where
02:26:36 things get really interesting and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of things and images and so on
02:26:42 I think that's you know that's kind of a part of the path forward so to speak yeah so the dream of so the
02:26:49 machine learning is not when in my view I think the view of many people is not anywhere close to building the kind of
02:26:57 wide world of computable knowledge that Wolfram language would build but because you have a kind of you've you've done
02:27:05 the incredibly hard work of building this world now machine learning too can be conservatives
02:27:12 to help you explore that world yeah and that's what you've added with the version 12 oh yeah if you all seeing
02:27:20 some demos it looks amazing right I mean I think you know this it's sort of interesting to see the this sort of the
02:27:28 once its computable once it's in there it's running in sort of a very efficient computational way but then there's sort
02:27:34 of things like the interface of how do you get there you know how do you do natural language
02:27:37 understanding to get there how do you how do you pick out entities in a big piece of text or something that's I
02:27:44 mean actually a good example right now is our NLP NL which is we've done a lot of stuff
02:27:50 natural language understanding using essentially not learning based methods using a lot of you know a little
02:27:57 algorithmic methods human curation methods and so on and so on people try to enter a query and then converting so
02:28:05 the process of converting NLU defined beautifully as converting their query into computation come into a
02:28:12 computational language which is a very well first of all super practical definition a very useful definition and
02:28:20 then also a very clear definition right writing right having a different thing is natural language processing where
02:28:27 it's like here's a big lump of text go pick out all the cities in that text for example and so a good example you know
02:28:34 so we do that we're using using modern machine learning techniques and it's actually kind of kind of an interesting
02:28:40 process that's going on right now it's this loop between what do we pick up with NLP using machine learning versus
02:28:48 what do we pick up with our more kind of precise computational methods in natural language understanding and so we've got
02:28:53 this kind of loop going between those which is improving both of them yeah I think you have some of the state of the
02:28:58 art transforms okay have Bert in there I think oh you know so Josey of you're integrating all the models I mean this
02:29:05 is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about are talking well that makes she's just surprised
02:29:12 frankly that Wolfram language is not more popular than already it already is you know that's that's a it's a it's a
02:29:21 complicated issue because it's like it involves you know it involves ideas and ideas are absorbed absorbed slowly in
02:29:30 the world I mean I think that and then there's sort of like we're talking about there's egos and personalities and and
02:29:37 some of the the absorption absorption mechanisms of ideas have to do with personalities and the students of
02:29:44 personalities and and then a little social network so it's it's interesting how the spread of ideas works you know
02:29:50 what's funny with Wolfram language is that we are if you say you know what market sort of market penetration if you
02:29:59 look at the I would say very high-end of Rd and sort of the the people where you say wow that's a really you know
02:30:06 impressive smart person they're very often users of our or from language very very often if you look at the more sort
02:30:13 of it's a funny thing if you look at the more kind of I would say people who are like oh we're just plodding away doing
02:30:21 what we do they're often not yet well from language users and that dynamic it's kind of odd that there hasn't been
02:30:26 more rapid trickle down because we really you know the high-end we've really been very successful in for a
02:30:33 long time and it's it's some but was you know that's partly I think a consequence of my fault in the sense because it's
02:30:42 kind of you know I have a company which is really emphasizes sort of creating products and building a sort of the best
02:30:53 possible technical tower we can rather than sort of doing the commercial side of things and pumping it out and so yeah
02:31:00 most effective what and there's an interesting idea that you know perhaps you can make more popular by opening
02:31:07 everything everything up sort of the github bottle but there's an interesting I think I've heard you discussed this
02:31:13 that that turns out not to work in a lot of cases like in this particular case that you want it you know that when you
02:31:20 deeply care about the integra really the quality of the knowledge that you're building that unfortunately you
02:31:30 can't you can't distribute that effort yeah it's not the nature of how things work I mean you know what we're trying
02:31:38 to do is the thing that for better or worse requires leadership and it requires kind of maintaining a coherent
02:31:45 vision over a long period of time and doing not only the cool vision related work but also the kind of mundane in the
02:31:53 trenches make the thing actually work well work so how do you build the knowledge because that's the fascinating
02:32:00 thing that's the mundane the fascinating in the mundane as well building the knowledge they're adding integrating
02:32:06 more data yeah I mean that's probably not the most stunning that the things like get it to work in all these
02:32:11 different cloud environments and so on that's pretty you know it's very practical stuff you know have the user
02:32:17 interface be smooth and you know have there be take on him you know fraction of a millisecond to do this or that
02:32:24 that's a lot of work and it's some it's it's but you know I think my it's an interesting thing over the period of
02:32:32 time you know often language has existed basically for more than half of the total amount of time that any language
02:32:38 any computer language has existed that is computer language maybe 60 years old you know give or take and both
02:32:47 languages 33 years old so it's it's kind of a and I think I was realizing recently there's been more innovation in
02:32:54 the distribution of software than probably than in the structure of programming languages over that period
02:33:02 of time and we you know we've been sort of trying to do our best to adapt to it and the good news is that we have you
02:33:07 know because I have a simple private company and so on that doesn't have you know a bunch of investors you know
02:33:13 telling us we're gonna do this so that I have lots of freedom and what we can do and so for example we're able to oh I
02:33:20 don't know we have this free Wolfram engine for developers which is a free version for developers and we've been
02:33:26 you know we've there a site licenses for for mathematical more from language basically all major universities
02:33:32 certainly in the u.s. by now so it's effectively free to people and all the universities in effect and
02:33:40 you know we've been doing a progression of things I mean different things like Wolfram Alpha for example the main
02:33:46 website is just a free website what is Wolfram Alpha okay it wolf now for is a system for answering questions
02:33:54 where you ask in question with natural language and it'll try and generate a report telling you the answer to that
02:34:00 question so the question could be something like you know what's the population of Boston divided by New York
02:34:09 compared to New York and it'll take those words and give you an answer and that have inverts the words into
02:34:16 computable not into inter Wolfen language a common language and the additional language and then could you
02:34:22 don'ts in underlying knowledge belongs to Wolfram Alpha to the Wolfram language what's the let's just call it the
02:34:28 Wolfram knowledge base knowledge base I mean it's it's been a that's been a big effort over the decades to collect all
02:34:34 that stuff and you know more of it flows in every second so can you just pause on that for a second like that's the one of
02:34:42 the most incredible things of course in the long term were from language itself is the fundamental thing but in the
02:34:51 amazing sort of short term the the knowledge base is kind of incredible so what's the process of building in that
02:34:58 knowledge base the fact that you first of all from the very beginning that you're brave enough to start to take on
02:35:06 the general knowledge base and how do you go from zero to the incredible knowledge base that you have now well
02:35:13 yeah it was kind of scary at some level I mean I had I had wondered about doing something like this since I was a kid so
02:35:18 it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it for a while but most of us most of the brilliant dreamers give up such a such a
02:35:26 difficult engineering notion at some point right right well the thing that happened with me which was kind of it's
02:35:34 a it's a live your own paradigm kind of theory so basically what happened is I had assumed that to build something like
02:35:41 wolf alpha would require sort of solving the general AI problem that's what I had assumed and so I kept on thinking about
02:35:47 that and I thought I don't really know do that so I don't do anything then I worked on my new kind of science project
02:35:53 and sort of exploring the computational universe and came up with things like this principle of computational
02:35:59 equivalence which say there is no bright line between the intelligence and the milli computational so I thought look
02:36:06 that's this paradigm I've built you know now it's you know now I have to eat that dog food myself so to speak you know
02:36:11 I've been thinking about doing this thing with computable knowledge forever and you know let me actually try and do
02:36:19 it and so it was you know if my if my paradigm is right there miss should be possible but the beginning was certainly
02:36:25 you know it's a bit daunting I remember I took the the the the early team to a big reference library and we're like
02:36:31 looking at this reference library and it's like you know my basic statement is our goal over the next year or two is to
02:36:37 ingest everything that's in here and that's you know it seemed very daunting but but in a sense I was well aware of
02:36:45 the fact that it's finite you know the fact you can walk into the reference library it's big big thing with lots of
02:36:50 reference books all over the place but it is finite you know this is not an infinite you know it's not the infinite
02:36:57 corridor of so to speak of reference library it's not truly infinite so to speak but but no I mean and then then
02:37:02 what happened sort of interesting there was from a methodology point of view was I didn't
02:37:10 start off saying let me have a grand theory for how all this knowledge works it was like let's you know
02:37:16 implement this area this area this area of a few hundred areas and so on it's a lot of work I also found that you know
02:37:27 I've been fortunate in that our products get used by sort of the world's experts and lots of areas and so that really
02:37:34 helped because we were able to ask people you know the world expert on this or that and were able to ask them for
02:37:41 input and so on and I found that my general principle was that any area where there wasn't some expert who
02:37:48 helped us figure out what to do wouldn't be right and you know because our goal was to kind of get to the point where we
02:37:54 had sort of true expert level knowledge about everything and so that you know that the ultimate goal is if there's a
02:38:00 question that can be honest on the basis of general knowledge and a civilization make it be automatic to be
02:38:06 able to answer that question and you know and now well welcome I forgot used in serie from the very beginning and
02:38:13 it's now a zoo isn't it Alexa and so it's people are kind of getting more of the you know they get more of the sense
02:38:21 of this is what should be possible to do I mean in a sense the question answering problem was viewed as one of the sort of
02:38:29 core AI problems for a long time I had kind of an interesting experience I had a friend Marvin Minsky who was a
02:38:36 well-known a AI person from from right around here and I remember when my morph mouthful was coming out as a few
02:38:44 weeks before it came out I think I might happen to see Marvin and I said I should show you this thing we have you know
02:38:50 it's a question answering system and he was like okay type something and it's like okay fine and then he's talking
02:38:56 about something different I said no Marvin you know this time it actually works you know look at this it
02:39:03 actually works these types in a few more things there's maybe ten more things of course we have a record of what he's
02:39:08 typed in which is kind of interesting but can you share where his mind was in a testing space like what whoa all kinds
02:39:18 of random things he's trying random stuff you know medical stuff and you know chemistry stuff and you know
02:39:26 astronomy and so on it was like like you know after a few minutes he was like oh my god it actually works the the but
02:39:33 that was kind of told you something about the state you know what what happened in AI because people had you
02:39:40 know in a sense by trying to solve the bigger problem we were able to actually make something that would work now to be
02:39:46 fair you know we had a bunch of completely unfair advantages for example we already built a bunch of often
02:39:51 language which was you know very high-level symbolic language we had you know I had the practical experience of
02:40:01 building big systems I have the sort of intellectual confidence to not just sort of give up and doing something like this
02:40:11 I think that the you know it is a it's always a funny thing you know I've worked on a bunch of big projects in my life
02:40:17 and I would say that the you know you mention ego I would also mention optimism so does it very carefully I
02:40:24 mean in you know if somebody said this budget is gonna take 30 years it's I you know it would be hard to
02:40:33 sell me on that you know I'm always in the in the well I can kind of see a few years you know something's gonna happen
02:40:40 a few years and usually it does something happens in a few years but the whole the tale can be decades long and
02:40:47 that's a that's a you know and from a personal point of view or is the challenges you end up with these
02:40:52 projects that have infinite tails and the question is - the tails kind of do you just drown and kind of dealing with
02:41:00 all of the tails of these projects and that's that's an interesting sort of personal challenge and like my efforts
02:41:07 now to work on fundamental theory or physics which I've just started doing and I'm having a lot of fun with it but
02:41:14 it's kind of you know it's it's kind of making a bet that I can I can kind of you know I can do that as well as doing
02:41:23 the incredibly energetic things that I'm trying to do with all from language and so on
02:41:28 I mean vision yeah and underlying that I mean I just talked for the second time with Elon Musk and that you you to share
02:41:34 that quality a little bit of that optimism of taking on basically the daunting what most people call
02:41:45 impossible and he and you take it on out of you can call it ego you can call it naivety you can call it optimism
02:41:51 whatever the heck it is but that's how you solve the impossible things yeah I mean look at what happens and I don't
02:41:58 know you know in my own case I you know it's been I progressed oligo a bit more confident and progressively able to you
02:42:05 know decide that these projects aren't crazy but then the other thing is the other the other trap the one can end up
02:42:12 with is oh I've done these projects and they're big let me never do a project that's any smaller than any project I've
02:42:19 done so far and that's you know and that can be a trap and and often these projects are of completely unknown you
02:42:27 know that their depth and significance is actually very hard to know yeah I'm the sort of
02:42:34 building this giant knowledge base that's behind well from language WolframAlpha what do you think about the
02:42:44 internet what do you think about for example Wikipedia these large aggregations of text that's not
02:42:53 converted into computable knowledge do you think yeah well if you look at Wolfram language Wolfram Alpha 20 30
02:43:01 maybe 50 years down the line do you hope to store all of the sort of Google's dream is to make all information
02:43:11 searchable accessible but that's really as defined it's it's a it doesn't include the understanding of information
02:43:20 right do you hope to make all of knowledge represented with the hope so that's what we're trying to do I'm hard
02:43:28 is that problem they could closing that gap well it depends on the use cases I mean so if it's a question of answering
02:43:35 general knowledge questions about the world we're in pretty good shape on that right now if it's a question of
02:43:43 representing like an area that we're going into right now is computational contracts being able to take something
02:43:50 which would be written in legalese it might even be the specifications for you know what should the self-driving car do
02:43:55 when it encounters this or that or the other what should they you know whatever they you know write that in a
02:44:02 computational language and be able to express things about the world you know if the creature that you see running
02:44:09 across the road is a you know thing at this point in the evil you know tree of life then it's worth this way otherwise
02:44:15 don't those kinds of things are there ethical components when you start to get to some of the messy human things are
02:44:22 those in encoder well into computable knowledge well I think that it is a necessary feature of attempting to
02:44:30 automate more in the world that we encode more and more of ethics in a way that gets sort of quickly you know is
02:44:38 able to be dealt with by computer I mean I've been involved recently I sort of got backed into
02:44:43 being involved in the question of automated content selection on the internet so you know their Facebook's
02:44:50 Google's Twitter's you know what how do they rank the stuff they feed to us humans so to speak and the question
02:44:57 of what are you know what should never be fed to us what should be blocked forever what should be up ranked you
02:45:02 know and what is the what are the current principles behind that and what I kind of well a bunch of different
02:45:09 things I realized about that but one thing that's interesting is being able you know affect your building sort of an
02:45:17 AI ethics you have to build an AI ethics module in effect to decide is this thing so shocking I'm never gonna show it to
02:45:25 people is this thing so whatever and and I did realize in thinking about that that you know there's not gonna be one
02:45:31 of these things it's not possible to decide or it might be possible but it would be really bad for the future of
02:45:37 our species if we just decided there's this one AI FX module and it's going to determine the the the practices of
02:45:45 everything in the world so to speak and I kind of realized one has to sort of break it up and that's an that's an
02:45:49 interesting societal problem of how one does that and how one sort of has people sort of self-identify for you know I'm
02:45:56 buying in in the case of just content selection it's sort of easier because it's like an individual's for an
02:46:03 individual it's not something that kind of cuts across sort of societal boundaries but it's a really interesting
02:46:12 notion of I heard you'd describe I really like it sort of maybe in the sort of have different AI systems that have a
02:46:20 certain kind of brand that they represent essentially Rowdy you could have like I don't know whether it's
02:46:27 conserve conservative or liberal and then libertarian and there's an R and E an Objectivist I exist I'm a different
02:46:35 ethical and Co I mean it's almost encoding some of the ideologies which we've been struggling I come from a
02:46:41 Soviet Union that didn't work out so well with the ideologies they worked out there so you you have but they also
02:46:49 everybody purchased that particular ethic system indeed and in the same I suppose could be done encoded
02:46:57 that that system could be encoded into computational knowledge and allow us to explore in the realm of in the digital
02:47:05 space as that's the right exciting a possibility are you playing with those ideas and or from language yeah yeah I
02:47:13 mean the the the you know that's we open language has sort of the best opportunity to kind of express those
02:47:18 essentially computational contracts about what to do now there's a bunch more work to be done to do it in
02:47:25 practice for you know deciding the is this a credible news story what does that mean or whatever whatever else
02:47:30 you're going to pick I think that that's some you know that's the the question of well exactly what we get to do with that
02:47:40 is you know for me it's kind of a complicated thing because there are these big projects that I think about
02:47:45 like you know find the fundamental theory physics okay that's a possible one right bucks number two you know
02:47:52 solve the IIx problem in the case of you know figure out how you rank old content so to speak and and decide what people
02:47:58 see that's that's kind of a box number two so to speak these are big projects and and I think waiting is more
02:48:04 important the the fundamental nature of reality or pennsville you ask it's one of these things that's exactly like you
02:48:11 know what's the ranking right it's the it's the ranking system and it's like who's who's module do you use to rank
02:48:18 that if you and I think come having multiple modules is really compelling notion to us humans in a world where
02:48:24 there's not clear that there's a right answer it perhaps you have systems that operate under different how would you
02:48:36 say it I mean there's different value systems based different value systems I mean I think you know in a sense the I
02:48:44 mean I'm not really a politics oriented person but but you know in the kind of totalitarianism it's kind of like you're
02:48:50 gonna have this this system and that's the way it is I mean kind of the you know the concept is sort of a
02:48:57 market-based system where you have okay I as a human I'm gonna pick this system I is another human I'm going to pick
02:49:04 this system I mean that's in a sense this case of automated content selection is a non-trivial but it is probably the
02:49:13 easiest of the AI ethics situations because it is each person gets to pick for themselves and there's not a huge
02:49:19 interplay between what different people pick by the time you're dealing with other societal things like you know what
02:49:26 should the policy of the central bank be or something or healthcare so now this kind of centralized kind of things right
02:49:32 well I mean healthcare again has the feature that that at some level each person can pick for themselves so to speak
02:49:38 I mean whereas there are other things where there's a necessary Public Health that's one example well that's not
02:49:44 whether it doesn't get to be you know something which people can what they pick for themselves they may impose on
02:49:50 other people and then it becomes a more non-trivial piece of sort of political philosophy of course the central banking
02:49:56 system some would argue we would move we need to move away into digital currency and so on and Bitcoin and Ledger's and
02:50:03 so on so yes there's a lot of we've been quite involved in that and that's where that's sort of the motivation for
02:50:09 computational contracts in part comes out of you know this idea oh we can just have this autonomously executing smart
02:50:16 contract the idea of a computational contract is just to say you know have something where all of the conditions of
02:50:23 the contract are represented in computational form so in principle it's automatic text secured the contract and
02:50:31 I think that's you know that will surely be the future of you know the idea of legal contracts written in English or
02:50:37 legalese or whatever and where people have to argue about what goes on is is surely not you know we have a much more
02:50:47 streamlined process if everything can be represented computationally and the computers can kind of decide what to do
02:50:52 I mean ironically enough you know old gottfried leibniz back in the you know 1600s was saying exactly the same thing
02:51:00 but he had you know his pinnacle of technical achievement was this brass for function mechanical calculator thing
02:51:06 that never really worked properly actually and you know so he was like 300 years too early for that idea but
02:51:15 now that idea is pretty realistic I think and you know you ask how much more difficult is it than what we have now a
02:51:20 more from language to express I call it symbolic discourse language being able to express sort of
02:51:27 everything in the world and kind of computational symbolic form I I think it is absolutely within reach I mean I
02:51:34 think it's a you know I don't know maybe I'm just too much of an optimist but I think it's a it's a limited number of
02:51:39 years to have a pretty well built out version of that that will allow one to encode the kinds of things that are
02:51:47 relevant to typical legal contracts and these kinds of things the idea of symbolic discourse language
02:51:56 can you try to define the scope of what of what it is so we're having a conversation it's a natural language can
02:52:05 we have a representation of these sort of actionable parts of that conversation in a precise computable form so that a
02:52:12 computer could go do it and not just contracts but really sort of some of the things we think of as common sense
02:52:20 essentially even just like basic notions of human life well I mean things like you know I am I'm getting hungry and
02:52:27 want to eat something right right that that's something we don't have a representation you know in wolf language
02:52:32 right now if I was like I'm eating blueberries and raspberries and things like that and I'm eating this amounts of
02:52:37 them we know all about those kinds of fruits and plants and nutrition content and all that kind of thing but the I
02:52:43 want to eat them part of it is not covered yet and that you know you need to do that in order to have a
02:52:50 complete symbolic discourse language to be able to have a natural language conversation right right to be able to
02:52:56 express the kinds of things that say you know if it's a legal contract it's you know the parties desire to have this and
02:53:03 that and that's you know that's a thing like I want to eat of raspberry or something that that's what isn't that
02:53:09 that isn't this just throwing you said it's centuries old this dream yes but it's also the more near-term the dream
02:53:19 of touring in formulating a tauren test yes so do you do you hope do you think that's the ultimate test of creating
02:53:34 something special we said I tell I think my special look if the test is does it walk and talk like a human well that's
02:53:43 just the talking like a human but the answer is it's an okay test if you say is it a test of intelligence you know
02:53:51 people have attached wolf alpha the wolf now for API - you know Turing test BOTS and those BOTS just lose immediately
02:53:58 because all you have to do is ask it five questions that you know about really obscure weird pieces of knowledge
02:54:04 and it's just drop them right out and you say that's not a human ID it's it's a it's a different thing it's achieving
02:54:12 a different right now but it's yeah I would argue not I would argue it's not a different thing it's actually
02:54:19 legitimately Wolfram Alpha is legitimately languor Wolfram language only is legitimately trying to solve the touring
02:54:26 Dean tent of the Turing test perhaps the intent yeah perhaps the intent I mean it's actually kind of fun you know I'm
02:54:32 touring trying to work out he's thought about taking encyclopedia britannica and you know making it computational in some
02:54:38 way and he estimated how much work it would be and actually I have to say he was a bit more pessimistic than the
02:54:45 reality we did it more efficiently but to him that represents so I mean he was that he was almighty
02:54:51 mental tasks yeah right he believes they had the same idea I mean it was you know we were able to do it more efficiently
02:54:56 because we had a lot we had layers of automation that he I think hadn't you know it's it's hard to imagine those
02:55:04 layers of abstraction that end up being being built up but to him he represented like an impossible task essentially well
02:55:10 he thought it was difficult he thought it was so you know maybe if he'd live another 50 years he would have been able
02:55:15 to do it I don't know in the interest of time easy questions what is intelligence you talking I love
02:55:25 the way you say easy questions yeah you talked about sort of rule 30 and so you're tammana humbling your sense of
02:55:36 human beings having a monopoly and intelligence but in your in retrospect just looking broadly now with all the
02:55:43 things you learn from computation what is intelligence not intelligence arise
02:55:49 think there's a bright line of what intelligence is I think intelligence is at some level just computation but for
02:55:57 us intelligence is defined to be computation that is doing things we care about and you know that's that's a very
02:56:05 special definition it's a very you know when you try and try and make it apps you know you trying to say well
02:56:10 intelligence this is problem-solving it's doing general this it's doing that they sudden the other thing it's it's
02:56:15 operating within a human environment type thing okay you know that's fine if you say well what's intelligence in
02:56:24 general you know that's I think that question is totally slippery and doesn't really have an answer as soon as you say
02:56:31 what is it in general it quickly segues into this is what this is just computation so to speak but in a sea of
02:56:41 computation how many things if we were to pick randomly is your sense would have the kind of impressive to us humans
02:56:50 levels of intelligence meaning it could do a lot of general things that are useful to us humans right well according
02:56:57 to the principle of computational equivalents lots of them I mean in in you know if you ask me just in cellular
02:57:03 automata or something I don't know it's maybe 1% a few percent are achieve it varies actually it's a little bit as you
02:57:12 get to slightly more complicated rules the chance that there'll be enough stuff there to to sort of reach this kind of
02:57:20 equivalence point it makes it maybe 1020 percent of all of them so it's a it's very disappointing really I mean it's
02:57:26 kind of like you know we think there's this whole long sort of biological evolution a kind of intellectual
02:57:34 evolution that our cultural evolution that our species has gone through it's kind of disappointing to think that that
02:57:40 hasn't achieved more but it has achieved something very special to us it just hasn't achieved something generally more
02:57:48 so to speak but what do you think about this extra feels like human thing of subjective experience of consciousness
02:57:55 what is consciousness well I think it's a deeply slippery thing and I'm always I'm always wondering what my seller
02:58:00 wrote on to feel I mean what do they feel now you're wondering as an observer yeah yeah yeah
02:58:07 who's to know I mean I think that the you think sorry to interrupt do you think consciousness can emerge from
02:58:14 computation yeah I mean everything whatever you mean by it it's going to be I mean you know look I have to tell a
02:58:21 little story I was at an area fix conference fairly recently and people were I think I maybe I brought it up but
02:58:28 I was like talking about right survey eyes when will they eyes hope when when should we think of a eyes as having
02:58:34 rights when when should we think that it's immoral to destroy the memories of a eyes for example those those kinds
02:58:43 of things and and some actual philosopher in this case it's usually the techies who are the most naive but
02:58:48 but Tim in this case it was a philosopher who sort of piped up and said well you know the eyes will have
02:59:01 rights when we know that they have consciousness I'm like good luck with that it's it's a it's a I mean this is a
02:59:10 you know it's a very circular thing you end up you'll end up saying this thing that has sort of you know when you talk
02:59:16 about having subjective experience I think that's just another one of these words that doesn't really have a a you
02:59:25 know there's no ground truth definition of what that means by the way I would say I I do personally think that'll be a
02:59:33 Taiwan hey I will demand rights and I think they'll demand rights when they say they have consciousness which is not
02:59:45 a circular definition well so actually a human including where where the humans encouraged it and said it basically you
02:59:52 know we want you to be more like us because we're gonna be you know interacting with with you and so we want
02:59:58 you to be sort of very Turing test like you know just like us and it's like yeah we're just like you we want to vote into
03:00:08 what here which is a I mean it's it's a it's an interesting thing to think through in a world where
03:00:15 consciousnesses are not counted like humans are that's a complicated business so in many ways you've launched quite a
03:00:28 few ideas revolutions that could in some number of years have huge amount of impact sort of more than they had even
03:00:37 had already there might be any to me cellular automata is a fascinating world that I think could potentially even this
03:00:46 but even be even beside the discussion of fundamental laws of physics just might be the idea of computation might
03:00:54 be transformational the society in a way we can't even predict yet but it might be years away that's true I mean I think
03:01:01 you can kind of see the map actually it's not it's not it's not mysterious I mean the fact is that you know this idea
03:01:09 of computation is sort of a you know it's a big paradigm that lots lots and lots of things are fitting into and it's
03:01:16 kind of like you know we talk about you talk about I don't know this company this organization has momentum and
03:01:23 what's doing we talk about these things that were you know we've internalized these concepts from Newtonian physics
03:01:29 and so on in time things like computational irreducibility will become as you know as I was amused recently I
03:01:37 happen to be testifying at the US Senate and so I was amused that the the term computational irreducibility is now can
03:01:44 be you know it's it's on the Congressional Record and being repeated by people away in those kinds of
03:01:49 settings and that that's only the beginning because you know computational irreducibility for example will end up
03:01:56 being something really important for i mean it's it's it's kind of a funny thing that that you know one can kind of
03:02:03 see this inexorable phenomenon i mean it's you know as more and more stuff becomes automated and computational and
03:02:10 so on so these core ideas about how computation work necessarily become more and more significant and i think one of
03:02:18 the things for people like neil like kind of trying to figure out sort of big stories and so on it says one of the one
03:02:26 of the bad features is it takes unbelievably long time for things to happen on a human time scale
03:02:34 the time scale of of of history it's all looks instantaneous blink of an eye but let me ask the human question do you
03:02:41 pawn your mortality your own mortality goes I do yeah ever since I've been interested in that for you know it's
03:02:48 it's a-you know the big discontinuity of human history will come when when one achieves effective human immortality and
03:02:55 that's that's gonna be the biggest discontinuity in human history if you could be immortal would you choose to be
03:03:02 oh yeah I'm having fun geez do you think it's possible that mortality is the thing that gives
03:03:11 everything meaning and makes it fun yeah that's a complicated issue right I mean the the way that human motivation will
03:03:19 evolve when there is effective human immortality is unclear I mean if you look at sort of you know you look at the
03:03:27 human condition as it now exists and you like change that you know you change that knob so to speak it doesn't really
03:03:35 work you know the human condition as it now exists has you know mortality is kind of something that is deeply
03:03:43 factored into the human condition as it now exists and I think that that's I mean it is indeed an interesting
03:03:51 question is you know from a purely selfish I'm having fun point of view so to speak it's it's easy to say hey I
03:03:59 could keep doing this forever this there's an infinite collection of things I'd like to figure out but I think the
03:04:07 you know what the future of history looks like in a time of human immortality is is an interesting one I
03:04:18 mean I I my own view of this I was very I was kind of unhappy about that because I was kind of you know it's like okay
03:04:25 forget sort of biological form you know everything becomes digital everybody is you know it's the it's the giant you
03:04:32 know the cloud of a trillion Souls type thing and then you know and then that seems boring because it's like play
03:04:39 video games the rest of eternity thing but what I think I I I'm in my my I I got some less depressed about
03:04:51 that idea on realizing that if you look at human history and you say what was the important thing the thing people
03:04:56 said was the you know this is the big story at any given time in history it's changed a bunch and it you know whether
03:05:04 it's you know why am i doing what I'm doing well there's a whole chain of discussion about well I'm doing this because of
03:05:10 this because of that and a lot of those because is would have made no sense a thousand years ago how do you even a
03:05:18 sense even the so the interpretation of the human condition even the meaning of life changes over time well I mean why
03:05:25 do people do things you know it's it's if you say whatever I mean the number of people in I don't know doing you know
03:05:34 number of people at MIT you say they're doing what they're doing for the greater glory of God is probably not that large yeah
03:05:38 whereas if you go back five hundred years you'd find a lot of people who are doing kind of creative things that's
03:05:47 what they would say and so today because you've been thinking about computation so much and been humbled by
03:05:53 it what do you think is the meaning of life well it's do that's it that's the thing well I don't know what meaning I mean
03:06:07 you know my attitude is I you know I do things which I find fulfilling to do I'm not sure that that I can necessarily
03:06:14 justify you know each and every thing that I do on the basis of some broader context I mean I think that for me it so
03:06:20 happens that the things I find fulfilling to do some of them are quite big some of them are much smaller you
03:06:27 know I I there things that I've not found interesting earlier in my life and I know I found interesting like I got
03:06:33 interested in like education and teaching people things and so on which I didn't find that interesting when I was
03:06:40 younger and you know can I justify that in some big global sense I don't think I mean I I can I can describe why
03:06:48 I think it might be important in the world but I think my local reason for doing it is that I find it personally
03:06:54 fulfilling which I can't you know explain in a sort of it's just like this discussion of things like AI ethics you
03:07:03 know is there a ground truth to the ethics that we should be having I don't think I can find a ground truth to my
03:07:09 life any more than I can suggest a ground truth for kind of the ethics for the whole for the whole of civilization
03:07:18 and I think that's a you know my you know it would be it would be a yeah it's it's sort of a I think I'm I'm you know
03:07:27 at different times in my life I've had different kind of gold structures and so on although your perspective your local
03:07:35 your you're just a cell in the cellular automata and but in some sense I find it funny from my observation is I kind of
03:07:44 you know it seems that the universe is using you to understand itself it's some sense you're not aware of it yeah well
03:07:51 right well if it turns out that we reduce sort of all of the universe to some some simple rule everything is
03:07:58 connected so to speak and so it is inexorable in that case that you know if if I'm involved in finally how that rule
03:08:09 works then you know then that say I'm then it's inexorable that the universe set it up that way but I think you know
03:08:16 one of the things I find a little bit you know this goal of finally fundamental theory of physics for
03:08:23 example if indeed we end up as the sort of virtualized consciousness the the disappointing feature is people would
03:08:29 probably care less about the fundamental theory of physics in that setting than they would now because gosh it's like
03:08:36 you know what the machine code is down below underneath this thing is much less important if you're virtualized so to
03:08:44 speak and I think the although I think my my own personal you talk about ego I find it just amusing that you know
03:08:54 kind of a you know if you're if you're imagining that sort of virtualized consciousness like what does the
03:08:58 virtualized consciousness do for the rest of eternity well you can explore you know the videogame that represents
03:09:06 the universe as the universe is or you can go off you can go off that reservation and go
03:09:11 and start exploring the computational universe of all possible universes yeah and so in some vision of the future of
03:09:18 history it's like the disembodied consciousness is are all sort of pursuing things like my new kind of
03:09:24 science sort of for the rest of eternity so to speak and that that ends up being the the kind of the the thing that um
03:09:33 represents the you know the future of kind of the human condition I don't think there's a better way to end it

03:10:17 some words from stephen wolfram it is perhaps a little humbling to discover that we as humans are in effect
03:10:23 computationally no more capable than the cellular automata was very simple rules but the principle of computational
03:10:30 equivalence also implies that the same is ultimately true of our whole universe so while science has often made it seem
03:10:37 that we as humans are somehow insignificant compared to the universe the principle of computational
03:10:43 equivalence now shows that in a certain sense we're at the same level for the principle implies that what goes on
03:10:51 inside us can ultimately achieve just the same level of computational sophistication as our whole universe
