00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Michio Kaku he's a theoretical physicist futurist and professor at the City College of New
00:00:09 York he's the author of many fascinating books that explored the nature of our reality and the future of our civilization
00:00:18 they include Einsteins cosmos physics of the impossible feature of the mind parallel worlds and his latest the
00:00:25 future of humanity terraforming Mars interstellar travel immortality and our destiny beyond earth I think is
00:00:33 beautiful and important when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore through conversation subjects just
00:00:40 outside of our understanding that to me is where artificial intelligence is today just outside of our understanding
00:00:47 a place we have to reach for it for to uncover the mysteries of the human mind and build human level and superhuman
00:00:54 level AI systems that transform our world for the better this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you

00:01:07 connect with me on Twitter Alex Friedman spelled Fri D M am and now here's my conversation with Michio Kaku you've
00:01:16 mentioned that we just might make contact with aliens or at least hear from them within this century can you
00:01:24 elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism well this is a pure speculation of course of course but given the fact
00:01:31 that we've already identified 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy
00:01:39 for the first time we know that on average every single star on average has a planet going around it and about 1/5
00:01:49 or so of them have earth sized planets going around them so just do the math we're talking about out of a hundred
00:01:57 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy we're talking about billions of potential Earth size planets and to
00:02:05 believe that we're the only one is I think rather ridiculous given the odds and how many galaxies are there within
00:02:14 sight of the Hubble Space Telescope there are about a hundred billion galaxies so do the math how many stars
00:02:22 are there in the visible universe a hundred billion galaxies times a hundred billion stars per galaxy we're talking
00:02:32 about a number beyond human imagination and to believe that we're the only ones I think is is rather ridiculous so
00:02:41 you've talked about different types of types zero one two three four and five even of the car - of scale of the
00:02:50 different kind of civilizations do what do you think it takes if it is indeed a ridiculous notion that we're alone in
00:02:56 the universe what do you think it takes to reach out first to reach out through communication and connect well first of
00:03:05 all we have to understand the level of sophistication of an alien life-form if we make contact with them I think in
00:03:13 this century we'll probably pick up signals signals from an extraterrestrial civilization we'll pick up there I Love
00:03:21 Lucy and their Leave It to Beaver just ordinary day-to-day transmissions that they emit and the first thing we want to
00:03:29 do is to a decipher their language of course but be figure out at what level they are advanced on the Kardashev scale
00:03:39 I'm a physicist we rank things by two parameters energy and information that's how we rank black holes that's how you
00:03:48 rank stars that's how you rank civilizations in outer space so a type one civilization is capable of
00:03:58 harnessing planetary power they control the weather for example earthquakes volcanoes they can modify the course of
00:04:05 geologic events sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers type 2 would be stellar they play with stars entire
00:04:17 stars they use the entire energy output of a star sort of like Star Trek the Federation of Planets have colonized the
00:04:25 nearby stars so a type 2 would be somewhat similar to Star Trek type 3 would be galactic they
00:04:34 roam the Galactic space lanes and type 3 would be like Star Wars a galactic civilization then one day I was giving
00:04:43 this talk in London at the planetarium there and the little boy comes up to me and he says professor you're wrong
00:04:51 you're wrong this type 4 and I told them look kid there are planets stars and galaxies that's it folks
00:05:01 and he kept persisting and saying no there's time for the power of the continuum and I thought about it for a
00:05:09 moment and I said to myself is there an extra galactic source of energy the continuum of Star Trek and the answer is
00:05:18 yes there could be a type 4 and that's dark energy we now know that 73% of the energy of the universe is dark energy
00:05:29 dark matter represents maybe 23 percent or so and we only represent 4% we're the oddballs and so you begin to realize that yeah
00:05:39 they could be type 4 maybe even type 5 so type 4 you're saying being able to harness sort of like dark energy
00:05:46 something that permeates the entire universe so be able to plug into the entire entire universe is a source of
00:05:53 energy that's right and dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang it's why the galaxies are being pushed apart it's the
00:06:01 energy of nothing the more nothing you have the more dark energy that's repulsive and so the acceleration of the
00:06:09 universe is accelerating because the more you have the more you can have and that of course is by definition and
00:06:16 exponential curve it's called a discerner expansion and that's the current state of the universe and then
00:06:25 type 5 would that be would that be able to seek energy sources somehow outside of our universe however that idea yeah
00:06:34 what time five will be the multiverse multiverse I'm a quantum physicist and we quantum physicists don't believe that
00:06:41 the Big Bang happen once that would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and that means
00:06:47 that there could be multiple bangs happening all the time even as we speak today universes are being created and
00:06:56 that fits the data the inflationary universe is a quantum theory so there's a certain finite probability that
00:07:04 universes are being created all the time and for me this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing because you know
00:07:13 I was raised as a presbyterian but my parents were Buddhists and there's two diametrically opposed ideas about the
00:07:22 universe in Buddhism there's only nirvana there's no beginning there's no end there's only timelessness
00:07:29 but in Christianity there is the instant when God said let there be light in other words an instant of creation so
00:07:37 I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head and I now realize that it's possible to Mel them into a single
00:07:46 theory either the universe had a beginning or it didn't right wrong you see our universe had a beginning our
00:07:55 universe had an instant where somebody might have said let there be light but there other bubble universes out there
00:08:03 in a bubble bath of universes and that means that these universes are expanding into a dimension beyond our
00:08:11 three-dimensional comprehension in other words is hyperspace in other words 11 dimensional hyperspace
00:08:19 so Nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace where big bangs are happening all the time so we can now
00:08:28 combine two mutually exclusive theories of creation and Stephen Hawking for example even in his last book even said
00:08:37 that this is an argument against the existence of God he said there is no God because there was not enough time for
00:08:44 God to create the universe because the Big Bang happened in an instant of time therefore there was no time available
00:08:52 for him to create the universe but he see the multiverse idea means that there was a time before time
00:09:00 and there multiple times each bubble has its own time and so it means that there could actually be a universe before the
00:09:09 beginning of our universe so if you think of a bubble bath when two bubbles collide well when two bubbles fission to
00:09:17 create a baby bubble that's called the Big Bang so the Big Bang is nothing but the collision of universes or the
00:09:24 budding of universes this is a beautiful picture of our incredibly mysterious existence so is that humbling to you
00:09:33 exciting the idea of multiverses I don't even know how to even begin well you wrap my mind around citing for
00:09:40 me because what I do for a living is string theory that's my day job I get paid by the city of New York to work on
00:09:47 string theory yes and you see string theory is a multiverse theory so people say first of all what is string theory
00:09:55 string theory simply says that all the particles we see in nature the electron the proton the quarks what have you or
00:10:02 nothing with vibrations on a musical string on a tiny tiny little string you know D Robert Oppenheimer the creator of
00:10:10 the atomic bomb was so frustrated in the 1950s with all these subatomic particles being created in our atom smashers that
00:10:19 he announced he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in Physics should go to the physicist who does not discover a
00:10:28 new particle that year well today we think they're nothing but musical notes on these tiny little vibrating strings
00:10:35 so what is physics physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings what is chemistry chemistry is the
00:10:44 melodies you can play on these strings what is the universe the universe is a symphony of strings
00:10:53 and then what is the mind of God that Albert Einstein's so eloquently wrote about for the last thirty years of his
00:11:01 life the mind of God would be cosmic music resonating through eleven dimensional hyperspace so beautifully
00:11:10 put what do you think is the mind of Einstein's God do you think there's a way that we could untangle from this
00:11:20 from this universe of strings why are we here what is the meaning of it all well Steven Weinberg winner of the Nobel
00:11:28 Prize once said that the more we learned about the universe the more we learned that is pointless well I don't know I
00:11:37 don't profess to understand the great secrets of the universe however let me say two things about what the Giants of
00:11:44 physics have said about this question Einstein believed in two types of God one was the God of the Bible the
00:11:55 personal God the God that answers prayers walks on water as performs miracles smites the Philistines that's
00:12:01 the personal God that he didn't believe in he believed in the God of Spinoza the God of order simplicity harmony Beauty
00:12:12 the universe could have been ugly the universe could have been messy random but it's gorgeous
00:12:18 you realize that on a single sheet of paper we can write down all the known laws of the universe it's amazing on one
00:12:24 sheet of paper Einstein's equation is one-inch long string theory is a lot longer and so
00:12:32 it's a standard model but you could put all these equations on one sheet of paper it didn't have to be that way it
00:12:40 could have been messy and so Einstein thought of himself as a young boy entering this huge library for the first
00:12:49 time being overwhelmed by the simplicity elegance and beauty of this library but all he could do was read the first page
00:12:59 of the first volume well that library is the universe with all sorts of mysterious magical things
00:13:05 that we have yet to find and then Galileo was asked about this Galileo said that the purpose of science the
00:13:15 purpose of science is to determine how the heavens ago the purpose of religion is to determine how to go to heaven so
00:13:25 in other words science is about natural law and religion is about ethics how to be a good person how to go to heaven as
00:13:35 long as we keep these two things apart we're in great shape the problem occurs when people from the Natural Sciences
00:13:44 begin to pontificate about ethics and people from religion begin to pontificate about natural law that's
00:13:52 where we get into big trouble you think they're fundamentally distinct morality and ethics and our our idea of what is
00:13:59 right and what is wrong that's something that's outside the reach of string theory in physics that's
00:14:07 right if you talk to a squirrel about what is right and what is wrong yes there there's no reference frame for a
00:14:15 squirrel and realize that aliens from out of space if they ever come visit us they'll try to talk to us like we talked
00:14:22 to squirrels in the forest but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels because they don't talk back
00:14:27 to us same thing with aliens from out of space and they come down to earth
00:14:32 they'll be curious about us to a degree but after a while they just get bored because we have nothing to offer them so
00:14:40 our sense of right and wrong what does that mean compared to a squirrels sense of right and wrong now we of course do
00:14:50 have an ethics that keeps civilizations in line enriches our life and makes civilization possible and I think that's
00:14:59 a good thing but it's not mandated by a law of physics so if aliens do alien species were to
00:15:08 make contact forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer do you think they're more likely to
00:15:17 be friendly to befriend us or to destroy us well I think for the most part our they'll pretty much ignore us if you
00:15:24 were deer in the forest who do you fear the most do fear the hunter with his gigantic 16
00:15:32 gauge shotgun or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses well the guy with a briefcase could be a
00:15:41 developer about to basically flatten the entire forest destroying your livelihood so instinctively you may be afraid of
00:15:49 the hunter but actually the problem with deers in the forest is that they should fear developers in developing because
00:15:56 developers look at deer as simply getting in the way I mean in war the world's by hto wells the aliens did not
00:16:06 hate us if you read the book the aliens did not have evil intentions toward him Homo sapiens no we were in the way so I
00:16:18 think we have to realize that alien civilizations made viewers quite differently than in science fiction
00:16:24 novels however I personally believe and I cannot prove any of this I personally believe that they're
00:16:28 probably going to be peaceful because there's nothing that they want from our world I mean what are they gonna kick us
00:16:36 what are they gonna take us for gold no gold is a useless metal for the most part it's silver I mean is gold golden
00:16:45 color but that only affects Homo sapiens squirrels don't care about gold and so gold is a rather useless element rare
00:16:53 earths may be platinum-based elements rare earths for their electronics yeah maybe but other than that we have
00:17:00 nothing to offer them I mean think about it for a moment people love Shakespeare and they love
00:17:07 the arts and poetry but outside of the earth they mean nothing absolutely nothing I mean when I write down an
00:17:16 equation in string theory I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy there's an alien writing down that very
00:17:24 same equation in different notation but that alien on the other side of the galaxy Shakespeare poetry Hemingway it would be
00:17:35 nothing to him or her or it when you think about entities that's out there extraterrestrial do you think they would
00:17:44 naturally look something that even is recognizable to us as his life or can it would they be radically different well
00:17:53 how did we become intelligent basically three things made us intelligent one is our eyesight stereo eyesight we have the
00:18:02 eyes of a hunter stereo emissions will be lock-in on targets and and who is smarter predator or prey predators are
00:18:11 smarter than prey they have their eyes at the front of their face like lions tigers wild rabbits have eyes to the
00:18:20 side of their face why is that hunters have to zero in on the target they have to know how to ambush they have to know
00:18:28 how to hide camouflage sneak up stealth deceit that takes a lot of intelligence rabbits all they have to do is run so
00:18:37 that's the first criterion stereo eyesight of some sort second is the thumb the opposable thumb of some sort
00:18:46 could be a claw or tentacle so a hand-eye coordination and eye coordination is the way we manipulate
00:18:54 the environment and then three language because you know mama bear never tells baby bear to avoid the human hunter
00:19:02 bears just learned by themselves they never hand on information from one generation to the next so these are the
00:19:09 three basic ingredients of intelligence eyesight of some sort an opposable thumb or tentacle or claw of some sort and
00:19:17 language now ask yourself a simple question how many animals have all three just us it's just us I mean the primates
00:19:28 they have a language yeah they may get up to maybe 20 words but a baby learns a word-a-day several words a day a baby
00:19:38 learns and a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words while the maximum number words that you
00:19:46 can teach a gorilla in any language including their own language is about 20 or so and so we see the difference in
00:19:54 intelligence so when we meet aliens from outer space chances are they will have been descended from predators of some
00:20:02 sort they'll have some way to manipulate the environment and communicate their knowledge to the next generation that's
00:20:11 it folks so functionally that would that would be similar they would we would be able to recognize them well not
00:20:18 necessarily because I think even with Homo sapiens we are eventually going to perhaps become part cybernetic and
00:20:27 genetically enhanced already robots are getting smarter and smarter right now robots have the intelligence
00:20:36 of a cockroach but in the coming years our robots will be as smart as a mouse then maybe as smart as a rabbit if we're
00:20:46 lucky maybe as smart as a cat or a dog and by the end of the century who knows for sure our robots will be probably as
00:20:54 smart as a monkey now at that point of course they could be dangerous you see monkeys are self-aware they know
00:21:03 they are monkeys they may have a different agenda than us while dogs dogs are confused you see dogs think that we
00:21:16 are a dog that we're the top dog they're the underdog that's why they whimper and follow us and lick us all the time for
00:21:24 the top dog monkeys have no illusion at all they know who we are not monkeys and so I think that in the future we'll have
00:21:32 to put a chip in their brain to shut them off once our robots have murderous thoughts but that's in a hundred years
00:21:40 in 200 years the robots will be smart enough to remove that failsafe chip in their brain and then watch out at that
00:21:50 point I think rather than compete with our robots we should merge with them we should become part cybernetic so I think
00:21:58 we'll be beat alien life from outer space they may be genetically and and cybernetically enhanced genetically and
00:22:09 cybernetically enhanced Wow so let's talk about that full range in the near term and 200 years from now how
00:22:16 promising in the near term in your view is brain machine interfaces those starting to allow computers to talk
00:22:25 directly to the brains Elon Musk is working on that with neural link and there's other companies working on this
00:22:30 idea do you see promise there do you see hope for near-term impact well every technology has pluses and minuses
00:22:39 already we can be core memories I have a book the future of the mine or I detail some of these breakthroughs
00:22:45 we can now record simple memories of mice and send these memories on the Internet eventually we're going to do
00:22:52 this with primates at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles and then after that we'll have a memory chip
00:23:01 for Alzheimer's patients well test it out in alzheimerís patients because of course when Alzheimer is patients lose
00:23:08 their memory they wander they create all sorts of havoc wandering around oblivious to their surroundings and
00:23:16 they'll have a chip they'll push the button and memories memories will come flooding into their hippocampus and the
00:23:24 chip telling them where they live and who they are and so a memory chip is definitely in the cards and I think this
00:23:31 will eventually affect human civilization what is the future of the Internet the future of the Internet is
00:23:39 brain net brain net is when we send emotions feelings sensations on the internet and we will telepathically
00:23:48 communicate with other humans this way this is gonna affect everything look at entertainment remember the silent movies
00:23:56 a Charlie Chaplin was very famous during the era of silent movies but when the talkies came in nobody wanted to see
00:24:03 Charlie Chaplin anymore because he never talked in the movies and so a whole generation of actors lost their job and
00:24:11 a new series of actors came in next we're gonna have the movies replaced by rain net because in the future people
00:24:21 will say who wants to see a screen with images that's it sound an image that's called the movies yeah our entertainment
00:24:30 industry this multi-billion dollar industry is based on screens with moving images and sound but what happens when
00:24:40 emotions feelings sensations memories can be conveyed on the Internet it's going to change everything human
00:24:46 relations will change because you'll be able to empathize and feel the suffering of other people will be able to
00:24:54 communicate telepathically and this is this is coming you describe brain that in feature of the mind this is an
00:25:01 interesting concept do you think so you mentioned entertainment but what kind of effect would it have on our
00:25:09 personal relationships hopefully it will deepen it you realize that for most of human history for over 90% of human
00:25:20 history we only knew maybe 20 a hundred people yeah that's it folks that was your tribe that was everybody
00:25:29 you knew in the universe was only maybe 50 or a hundred with the coming of towns of course it expanded to a few thousand
00:25:37 with the coming of the telephone all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people with a telephone and now with the
00:25:43 internet you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth and so I think this is a normal progression and
00:25:51 you you think that kind of sort of connection to the rest of the world and then adding sensations like being able
00:25:58 to share telepathically emotions and so on that would just further deepen our connection to our fellow humans yes
00:26:05 right in fact I disagree with many scientists on this question most scientists would say that technology is
00:26:13 neutral a double-edged sword one sword one side of the sword can cut against people the other side of the sword can
00:26:20 cut against ignorance and disease I disagree I think technology does have a moral direction look at the Internet the
00:26:30 internet spreads knowledge awareness and that creates empowerment people act on knowledge when they begin to realize
00:26:37 that they don't have to live that way they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship that there are other ways
00:26:45 of living under freedom then they begin to take things take power and that spreads democracy and democracies do not
00:26:54 war with other democracies I'm a scientist I believe in data so let's take a sheet of paper and write down every single war
00:27:04 you had to learn since you were an elementary school every single war hundreds of
00:27:11 kings queens emperors dictators all these wars were between kings queens emperors and dictators never between two
00:27:20 major democracies and so I think with the spread of this technology and which would accelerate with the coming of
00:27:27 brain net it means that well we will still have wars wars of course as politics by other means but there'll be
00:27:35 less intense and less frequent do you have worries of longer-term existential risk from technology from AI so I think
00:27:47 that's a wonderful vision of a future where war is a distant memory but now there's another agent there's there's
00:27:56 there's somebody else that's able to create conflict that's able to create harm AI systems so do you have worry
00:28:04 about such AI systems well yes that is an existential risk but again I think an existential risk not for this century I
00:28:12 think our grandkids are gonna have to confront this question as robots gradually approach the intelligence of a
00:28:19 dog a cat and finally that of a monkey however I think we will digitize ourselves as well not only are we gonna
00:28:26 merge with our technology it will also digitize our personality our memories our feelings you realize who did during
00:28:33 the Middle Ages there was something called dualism dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body when the
00:28:40 body died the soul went to heaven that's dualism then in the 20th century neuroscience came in and said bah humbug
00:28:49 every time we look at the brain it's just neurons that's it folks period end of story
00:28:57 bunch of neurons firing now we're going back to dualism now we realize that we can digitize human memories feelings
00:29:08 sensations and create a digital copy of ourselves and that's called the connectome project billions of dollars
00:29:16 are now being spent to do not just the genome project of sequencing the genes of our body but the connectome project
00:29:24 which is to map the entire connections of the human brain and even before then already in Silicon Valley today at this
00:29:32 very moment you can contact Silicon Valley companies that are willing to digitize your relatives because some
00:29:39 people want to talk to their parents there are unresolved issues with their parents and one day yes firms will
00:29:46 digitize people and you'll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile we Lea we leave a digital trail our
00:29:54 ancestors did not our ancestors were lucky if they had one line just one line in a church book saying the day they
00:30:03 were baptized and the day they died that's it that was their entire digital memory I mean their entire digital
00:30:12 existence summarized in just a few letters of the alphabet a whole life now we digitized everything every time
00:30:20 you sneeze you digitized it you put it on the Internet and so I think that we are going to digitize ourselves and give
00:30:28 us digital immortality will not only have biologic genetic immortality of some sort but also digital immortality
00:30:36 and what are we going to do with it I think we should send it into outer space if you digitize the human brain and put
00:30:45 it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon you're on the moon in one second shoot it to Mars you're on Mars in 20 minutes
00:30:53 shoot it to Pluto you're on Pluto in eight hours think about it for a moment you can have breakfast in New York and
00:31:01 for a morning snack vacation on the moon then zap your way to Mars by noontime journey through the asteroid belt of the
00:31:09 afternoon and they come back for dinner in New York at night all in a day's work it's at the speed of light now this
00:31:19 means that you don't need booster rockets you don't need weightlessness problems you don't need to worry about meteorites
00:31:26 and what's on the moon on the moon there is a mainframe that downloads your laser beams information and where does it
00:31:35 download the information into an avatar now what does it ever try look like anything you want yeah think about it
00:31:43 for a moment you could be Superman superwoman on the moon on Mars traveling throughout the universe at the speed of
00:31:53 light downloading your personality into any vehicle you want now let me stick my neck out so for everything I've been
00:32:00 saying is well within the laws of physics well within the laws of physics now let me go outside the laws of
00:32:05 physics here we go I think this already exists I think outside the earth there could be a
00:32:13 superhighway a laser highway of laser pointing with billions of souls of aliens zapping their way across the
00:32:22 galaxy now let me ask you a question are we smart enough to determine whether such a thing exists or not no this could
00:32:31 exist right outside the orbit of the planet Earth and we're too stupid in our technology to even prove it or disprove
00:32:41 it we would need the aliens on this laser superhighway to help us out just to send us a human interpretable signal
00:32:52 I mean it ultimately boils down to the language of communication but that's an exciting possibility that actually the
00:32:59 sky is filled with aliens should already be here and we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it see they
00:33:07 don't have to be an alien form with with little green men they could be in any form they want in an avatar of their
00:33:14 creation or in fact they could very well be they look like us exactly he'd never know one of us could be an alien you
00:33:23 know in a zoo did you know that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals we create a fake animal and we
00:33:30 put it in so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal and of course these animals brains their brain is
00:33:37 about as big as a walnut they accept these dummies as if they were real so an alien civilization in outer space would
00:33:46 say oh yeah human brains are so tiny we could put a dummy on their world and avatar and they never know it that would
00:33:53 be an entertaining thing to watch from the alien perspective so you kind of implied that with it was a digital form
00:34:02 of our being but also biologically do you think one day technology will allow individual human beings to become
00:34:09 immortal besides just through the ability to digitize our essence yeah I think that artificial intelligence will
00:34:15 give us the key to to genetic immortality you see in the coming decades everyone's going to have their
00:34:22 gene sequence will have billions of genomes of old people billions of genomes of young people and
00:34:28 what are we going to do with it we're gonna run into an AI machine which has a pattern recognition to look for the Aged
00:34:36 genes in other words the Fountain of Youth that Emperor's kings and queens lusted a ver over the Fountain of Youth
00:34:45 will be found by artificial intelligence artificial intelligence will identify where these aged genes are located first
00:34:54 of all what is aging we now know what aging is aging is the build-up of errors that's all aging is the buildup of
00:35:04 genetic errors this means that cells eventually become slower sluggish if they go into senescence and they die in
00:35:15 fact that's why we die we die because of the build up of mistakes in our genome in our cellular activity but you've seen
00:35:22 the future we'll be able to fix those genes with CRISPR type technologies and perhaps even live forever so let me ask
00:35:28 you a question we're just aging take place in a car given a car where does aging take place
00:35:37 well it's obvious the engine right a that's where you have a lot of moving parts B that's where you have combustion
00:35:44 well where in the cell do we have combustion the mitochondria we know know where ageing takes place
00:35:54 and if we cure many of the mistakes that build up in the mitochondria of the cell we could become immortal let me ask you
00:36:01 if you self could become immortal would you damn straight
00:36:10 now I think about it for a while because of course if the term it depends on how you become immortal you know there's a
00:36:18 famous myth of Tiffany's it turns out that years ago the in the Greek mythology there was the saga of
00:36:26 Tiffany's and Aurora Aurora was the goddess of the dawn and she fell in love with a mortal a human called Athena's
00:36:36 and so Aurora begged big Zeus to grant her the the gift of immortality to give to her lover so Zeus took pity on Aurora
00:36:46 and made Tiffany's immortal but you see Aurora made a mistake a huge mistake she asked for immortality but she forgot
00:36:59 to ask for eternal youth so port Athena's got older and older and older every year decrepit a bag of bones but
00:37:09 he could never die never done quality of life is important so I think immortality is a great idea as long as you also have
00:37:18 immortal youth as well now I personally believe and I cannot prove this but I personally believe that our grandkids
00:37:25 may have the option of reaching the age of 30 and then stopping they may like being age 30 is you have wisdom you have
00:37:35 all the benefits of age and maturity and you still live forever with a healthy body our descendants may like being 30
00:37:43 for several centuries is there an aspect of human existence that is meaningful only because we're mortal well every
00:37:53 waking moment we don't think about it this way but every waking moment actually we are aware of our death and
00:38:00 our mortality think about it for a moment when you go to college you realize that you're in a period of time
00:38:08 where soon you will reach middle age and have a career and after that you'll retire and then you'll die and so even
00:38:15 as a youth even as a child without even thinking about it you are aware of your own death
00:38:24 because it sets limits to your lifespan I got a graduate from high school I got a graduate from college why because
00:38:31 you're gonna die because unless you graduate from high school unless you graduate from college
00:38:36 you're not gonna enter old age with enough money to retire and then die and so yeah people think about it
00:38:44 unconsciously because it affects every aspect of your being the fact that you go to high school college get married
00:38:53 have kids miss a clock a clock ticking even without your permission it gives a sense of urgency do you do you yourself
00:39:02 I mean there's so much excitement and passion in the way you talk about physics and we talk about technology in
00:39:09 the future do you yourself meditate on your own mortality do you think about this clock that's ticking well I try not
00:39:18 to because it begins to affect your behavior you begin to alter your behavior to to match your expectation of
00:39:27 when you're gonna die so let's talk about youth and then let's talk about death okay when I interview scientists
00:39:37 on radio I often ask them what made the difference how old were you what changed your life and they always say more or
00:39:44 less the same thing no these are Nobel Prize winners directors of major laboratories very distinguished
00:39:52 scientists they always say when I was 10 when I was 10 something happened it was a visit to the planetarium it was the
00:40:00 telescope for Steven Weinberg winner of the Nobel Prize it was the chemistry kid for Heinz piggles it was a visitor to
00:40:08 the planetarium for Isidor Rabi it was a book what the planets for Albert Einstein it was a compass something
00:40:16 happened which gives them this existential shock because you see before the age of 10 everything is mommy and
00:40:23 daddy mommy and dad that's your universe maja me and daddy around the age of 10 you begin to wonder what's beyond
00:40:31 me and daddy and that's when you have this epiphany when you realize oh my god there's a universe out there a universe
00:40:42 of discovery that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life you still remember that shock that you felt gazing
00:40:52 at the universe and then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists known to science the greatest destroyer of
00:41:03 scientists known to science is junior high school we knew hit junior high school folks it's all over yeah it's all
00:41:11 over because in junior high school people say hey stupid I mean you like that nerdy stuff and your friends shun
00:41:21 you all of a sudden you people think you're a weirdo and scientists made boring you know Richard Feynman the
00:41:28 Nobel Prize winner when he was a child his father would take him into the forest and the father would teach him
00:41:34 everything about birds why do you shape the way they are their wings the coloration the shape of their
00:41:43 beak everything about birds so one day a bully comes up to the future Nobel Prize winner and says hey dick what's the name
00:41:52 of that bird over there well he didn't know he knew everything about that bird except his name so he said I don't know
00:42:02 and then the bully said what's the matter dick you stupid or something and then in that instant he got it he got it
00:42:12 he realized that for most people science is giving names to birds that's what science is you know lots of names of
00:42:20 obscure things Hey people say you're smart you're smart you know all the names of the dinosaurs you know all the
00:42:28 names of the plants no that's not science at all science is about principles concepts physical pictures
00:42:38 that's what science is all about my favorite quote from Einstein is that unless you can explain a theory to a
00:42:47 child the theory is probably worthless meaning that all great theories are not big words all great theories are simple
00:42:58 concepts principles basic physical pictures our relativity is all about clocks meter sticks rocket ships and
00:43:08 locomotives Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls and spinning wheels and things like that
00:43:15 that's what physics and science is all about not memorizing things and that stays with you for the rest of your life
00:43:24 so even in old age I've noticed that these scientists when they sit back they still remember they still remember that
00:43:32 flush that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope that first moment when they encountered the
00:43:40 universe that keeps them going that keeps them going by the way I should point out that when
00:43:48 I was 8 something happened to me as well when I was 8 years old it was in all the papers that a great scientist had just
00:43:58 died and they put a picture of his desk on the front page that's it just a simple picture of the front page of the
00:44:06 newspapers of his desk that desk had a book on it which was opened and the caption said more or less this is the
00:44:14 unfinished manuscript from the greatest scientists of our time so I said to myself well why couldn't you finish it
00:44:25 what's so hard that you can't finish it if you're a great scientist it's a homework problem right
00:44:31 you go home you solve it or you ask your mom why couldn't he solve it so to me this was a murder mystery this was
00:44:38 greater than any adventure story I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time couldn't finish something and
00:44:45 then over the years I found out the guy had a name Albert Einstein and that book was the theory of everything it was
00:44:54 unfinished well today I can read that book I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made and I began to
00:45:03 realize that he lost his way because he didn't have a physical picture to guide him on the 3rd try on the first try he
00:45:13 talked about clocks and lightning bolts and meter sticks and they gave us special relativity which gave us the
00:45:22 atomic bomb the second great picture was gravity with balls rolling on curved surfaces and they gave us the big bang
00:45:30 creation of the universe black holes on the third try he missed it he had no picture at all to guide him
00:45:40 in fact there's a quote I have where he said I'm still looking I'm still looking for that picture he never found it well
00:45:48 today we think that picture is string theory the string theory can unify gravity and this mysterious thing that
00:45:55 ice tide didn't like which is mechanics Oh couldn't couldn't quite pin down and make sense of that's right
00:46:01 mother nature has two hands the left hand and a right hand the left hand is a theory of the small the right hand is a
00:46:08 theory of the big the theory the small is the quantum theory the theory of atoms and quarks the theory of the big
00:46:14 is relativity the theory of black holes big bangs the problem is the left hand does not
00:46:22 talk to the right hand they hate each other the left hand is based on discrete particles the right hand is based on
00:46:31 flute smooth surfaces how do you put these two things together into a single theory they hate each other the greatest
00:46:39 minds of our time the greatest minds of our time worked on this problem and failed today the only one the only
00:46:47 theory that has survived every challenge so far is string theory that doesn't mean string theory is correct it could
00:46:54 very well be wrong but right now is the only game in town some people come up to me and say
00:46:59 professor I don't believe in the string theory give me an alternative and I tell them there is none get used to it it's
00:47:10 the best theory we got it's the only theory we have it's the only theory we have do you see you know the strings
00:47:21 kind of inspire a view as did atoms and particles and quarks but especially strings inspire view of a universe as a
00:47:29 kind of information processing system as a as a computer of sorts do you see the universe in this way no some people
00:47:37 think in fact the whole universe is a computer of some sort yes and they believe that perhaps everything
00:47:45 therefore is a simulation yes I don't think so I don't think that there is a super video game where we are nothing
00:47:52 but puppets dancing on the screen and somebody hit the play button and here we are talking about simulations no even
00:48:01 Newtonian mechanics says that the weather the simple weather is so complicated with trillions upon
00:48:08 trillions of atoms that it cannot be simulated in a find out an amount of time in other
00:48:14 words the smallest object which can describe the weather and simulate the weather is the weather itself the
00:48:23 smallest object that can simulate a human is the human itself and if you had quantum mechanics it becomes almost
00:48:32 impossible to simulate it with a conventional computer is quantum mechanics deals with all possible
00:48:40 universes parallel universes a multiverse of universes and so the calculation just spirals out of control
00:48:49 now they're at so far there's only one way where you might be able to argue that the universe is a simulation and
00:48:56 this is still being debated by quantum physicists it turns out that if you throw the Encyclopedia into a black hole
00:49:03 the information is not lost eventually it winds up on the surface of the black hole now the surface of the
00:49:10 what I call is finite in fact you can calculate the maximum amount of information you can store in a black
00:49:16 hole it's a finite number it's a calculable number believe it or not now if the universe were made out of
00:49:22 black holes which is the maximum universe you can conceive of each universe each black hole has a finite
00:49:29 amount of information therefore our go that  our go the total amount of information in a
00:49:39 universe is finite this is mind-boggling this I consider mind-boggling that all possible universes are countable and all
00:49:49 possible universes can be summarized in a number a number you can write on a sheet of paper all possible universes
00:49:56 and it's a finite number now is huge it's a number beyond human imagination it's a number based on what is called
00:50:03 the Planck length but it's a number and so if a computer could ever simulate that number then it would the universe
00:50:10 would be a simulation so theoretically because it's because the amount of information is finite there well there
00:50:19 necessarily must be able to exist a computer it's just from an engineering perspective maybe impossible to be
00:50:26 yes so no computer can build a universe capable of simulating the entire universe except the universe itself
00:50:33 so that's your intuition that our universe is very efficient and so there's no shortcuts right - two reasons
00:50:40 why I believe the universe is not a simulation first the calculational numbers are just incredible no finite the Turing machine
00:50:49 can simulate the universe and second why would any super intelligent being simulate humans if you think about it
00:50:58 most humans are kind of stupid I mean we do all sorts of crazy stupid things right and we call it art we call it humor
00:51:06 we call it human civilization so why should an advanced civilization go through all that effort just to simulate
00:51:14 Saturday Night Live well that's a funny idea it's also do you think it's possible that the act of creation cannot
00:51:22 anticipate humans you simply set the initial conditions and set a bunch of physical laws and just for the fun of it
00:51:28 see what happens you'll launch the thing so you're not necessarily simulating everything you're
00:51:34 not simulating every little bit in in the same in the sense that you could predict what's going to happen but you
00:51:40 set the initial conditions set the laws and see what kind of fun stuff happens well some in some sense that's how life
00:51:49 got started in the 1950s Stanley did what is called the Miller experiment he put a bunch of hydrogen gas methane
00:52:00 toxic gases with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker and then he just walked away for a few weeks came back a
00:52:09 few weeks later and bingo out of nothing in chaos came amino acids if he had left it there for a few years he might have
00:52:17 gotten protein protein molecules for free that's probably how life got started as a accident and if he had left
00:52:26 it there for perhaps a few million years DNA might have formed in that beaker and so we think that yeah DNA life all that
00:52:35 could have been an accident if you wait long enough and remember our universe is roughly 13.8
00:52:43 billion years old that's plenty of time for lots of random things to happen including life itself
00:52:54 yeah we could be just a beautiful little random moment and there could be a nearly infinite
00:53:00 number of those in throughout the history of the universe many many creatures like us we perhaps are not the
00:53:07 epitome of what the universe is created for her thank God let's hope not just look around
00:53:16 yeah you're right what do you think the first human will step foot on Mars I think it's a good chance in 2030s that
00:53:26 we will be on Mars in fact there's no physics reason why we can't do it it's an engineering problem it's a very
00:53:33 difficult and dangerous engineering problem but it is an engineering problem and in my book future of humanity I even
00:53:41 speculate beyond that that by the end of the century we'll probably have the first starships the first starships will
00:53:48 not look like the enterprise at all they'll probably be small computer chips that are fired by laser beams with
00:53:57 parachutes and like what Stephen Hawking advocated the breakthrough starshot program could send ships ship to the
00:54:04 nearby stars traveling at 20% of speed of light reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time beyond that we
00:54:13 should have fusion power using power is in some sense one of the ultimate sources of energy but it's unstable and
00:54:22 we don't have fusion power today now why is that first of all stars for mammals for free
00:54:28 you get a bunch of gas large enough it becomes a star I mean you didn't have to do anything to it and it becomes a star
00:54:36 why is fusion so difficult to put on the earth because you're not a space stars our mana poles they are pole single
00:54:43 poles that sphere are there a spherically symmetric and it's very easy to get spherical symmetric
00:54:48 configurations of gas to compress into a star he just happens naturally all by itself
00:54:56 the problem is magnetism is bipolar you have a North Pole and a South Pole and it's like trying to squeeze a long
00:55:03 balloon take a long balloon and trying to squeeze it you squeeze one side it bulges out the other side well that's
00:55:10 the problem with fusion machines we use magnetism with the North Pole in the South Pole to squeeze gas and all sorts
00:55:19 of anomalies and horrible configurations can take place because we're not squeezing something uniformly like in a
00:55:26 star stars in some sense or for free fusion on the earth is very difficult but I think it's inevitable and it'll
00:55:35 eventually gave us unlimited power from seawater so seawater will be the ultimate source of energy for the planet Earth
00:55:43 why what's the intuition there because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater burn hydrogen in the fusion reactor to
00:55:51 get give us unlimited energy without the meltdown without the nuclear waste why do we have meltdowns
00:55:57 we have meltdowns because in the fission reactors every time you split the uranium atom you get nuclear waste tons
00:56:04 of it 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year and it's hot it's hot for thousands millions of years that's
00:56:13 why we have meltdowns but you see the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium gas helium gas is actually
00:56:20 commercially valuable you can make money selling helium gas and so the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium
00:56:28 not nuclear waste that we find in a commercial fission plant in that controlling mastering
00:56:36 controlling fusion allows us to converse us into a type 1 I guess civilization right yeah probably the backbone of a
00:56:44 type one civilization will be fusion power we by the way are type zero we don't even rate on this scale we get our
00:56:51 energy from dead plants for God's sake oil and coal but we are about a hundred years from being type one you know get a
00:56:59 calculator in fact Carl Sagan calculated that we are about 0.7 fairly close to a 1.0 for example what
00:57:09 is the internet the Internet is the beginning of the first type one technology to enter into our century the
00:57:16 first planetary technology is the Internet what is the language of type 1 on the internet already English and
00:57:24 Mandarin Chinese are the most dominant languages on the Internet and what about the culture we're seeing a type 1 Sports
00:57:35 soccer the Olympics a type 1 music a youth culture rock and roll rap music type 1 fashion Gucci Chanel a type 1
00:57:44 economy the European Union NAFTA what have you so we're beginning to see the the beginnings of a type 1 culture in a
00:57:53 type one civilization and inevitably it will spread beyond this planet so you talked about sending at 20% the speed of
00:58:05 light on a chip into Alpha Centauri but in a slightly nearer term what do you think about the idea when we still have
00:58:12 to send biological our biological bodies the colonization of planets colonization of Mars DC is becoming a two-planet
00:58:24 species ever or any time soon well just remember the dinosaurs did not have a space program now and that's why they're
00:58:30 not here today how come there are no dinosaurs in this room today because they didn't have a space program we do
00:58:38 have a space program which means that we have an insurance policy now I don't think we should bankrupt the earth or
00:58:45 deplete the earth to go to Mars that's too expensive and not practical but we need a settlement a settlement on Mars
00:58:52 in case something bad happens to the planet Earth and that means we have to terraform Mars now to terraform Mars if
00:59:00 we get raised a temperature of Mars by 6 degrees 6 degrees then the polar icecaps begin to melt releasing water vapor
00:59:10 water vapor is the greenhouse gas it causes even more melting of the ice caps so it becomes a self-fulfilling
00:59:19 see it feeds on itself it becomes autocatalytic and so once you hit six degrees were rising of the temperature
00:59:27 on Mars by six degrees it takes off and we melt the polar ice caps and liquid water once again flows in the rivers the
00:59:36 canals are the channels and the oceans of Mars Mars once had an ocean we think about the size of the United States and
00:59:45 so that is a possibility now how do we get there how do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees Elon
00:59:50 Musk would like it didn't a hydrogen warheads on the polar icecaps yes well I'm not sure about that because we don't
00:59:59 know that much about the effects of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps and who wants to glow in
01:00:06 the dark at night reading the newspaper so I think there are other ways to do it with solar satellites you can have
01:00:14 satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight onto the polar ice caps melting the polar ice caps Mars has plenty of
01:00:25 water it's just frozen I think you paint and inspiring in a wonderful picture of the future it's I think you've inspired
