00:00:01 the following is a conversation with convoked he is the president and the CTO of Cruz Automation leading an effort to
00:00:08 solve one of the biggest robotics challenges of our time vehicle automation he's a co-founder of two
00:00:14 successful companies twitch and crews that have each sold for a billion dollars and he's a great example of the
00:00:20 innovative spirit that flourishes in Silicon Valley and now is facing an interesting and exciting challenge of
00:00:29 matching that spirit with the mass production and the safety centric culture of a major automaker like
00:00:35 General Motors this conversation is part of the MIT artificial general intelligence series and the artificial
00:00:41 intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube itunes or simply connect with me on twitter at Lex
00:00:50 Friedman spelled Fri D and now here's my conversation with Kyle vote grew up in Kansas right yeah and I just
00:00:58 saw that picture you had you know there's them a little bit a little bit worried about that yeah so in high
00:01:03 school in Kansas City you joined Shawnee Mission North High School Robotics team yeah now that wasn't your high school
00:01:11 that's right that was that was the only high school in the area that had a like a teacher who was willing to sponsor a
00:01:17 FIRST Robotics team I was gonna troll you a little bit jog your mess trying to look super cool and intense
00:01:24 because you know this was BattleBots it's a serious business so we're standing there with a welded
00:01:30 steel frame and looking tough so go back there what is that jury to robotics well I think I've been trying to figure this
00:01:37 out for a while but I've always liked building things with Legos and when I was really really young I wanted the
00:01:42 Legos I had motors and other things and then you know Lego Mindstorms came out and for the first time you could program
00:01:49 Lego contraptions and I think things just sort of snowballed from that but I remember seeing you know the battle bots
00:01:58 TV show on Comedy Central and thinking that is the coolest thing in the world I want to be a part of that and not
00:02:03 knowing a whole lot about how to build these 200-pound fighting robots so I sort of obsessively pored over the
00:02:11 internet forums where all the creator's for battle bots would sort of hang out and talk about you know document their
00:02:17 build progress and everything and I think I read I must have read like you know tens of thousands of forum posts
00:02:24 from from basically everything that was out there on what these people were doing and eventually like sort of
00:02:29 triangulated how to how to put some of these things together and and ended up doing battle bots which was you know I
00:02:35 was like 13 or 14 which is pretty awesome I'm not sure if the show is still running but the battle bots is
00:02:41 there's not an artificial intelligence component it's remotely controlled and yeah it's an almost like a mechanical
00:02:47 generic challenge yeah I think things that can be broken they're radio-controlled so and I think that
00:02:53 they allowed some limited form of autonomy but you know in a two-minute match you're in and the way these things
00:02:59 ran you're really doing yourself a disservice by trying to automate it versus just you know do the practical
00:03:04 thing which is drive it yourself the entertainment aspect just going on YouTube there's like and some of them
00:03:11 wield an axe some of them I mean there's that fun so what drew you to that aspect it wasn't the mechanical engineering was
00:03:19 it the dream to create like Frankenstein and sentient being I was just like the Lego you like tinkering with stuff I
00:03:25 mean that that was just building something I think the the idea of you know this this radio-controlled machine
00:03:31 that that can do various things if it has like a weapon or something was pretty interesting I agree it doesn't
00:03:36 have the same appeal as you know autonomous robots which I which I you know sort of gravitated towards later on
00:03:41 but it was definitely an engineering challenge because everything you did in in that competition was pushing
00:03:49 components to their limits so we would buy like these $40 DC motors that came out of a winch like on the front of a
00:03:57 pickup truck or something and we'd power the car with those and we'd run them at like double or triple their rated
00:04:03 voltage so they immediately start overheating but for that 2-minute match you can get you know a significant
00:04:08 increase in the power output of those motors before they burn out and so you're doing the same thing for your
00:04:13 battery packs all the materials in the system and I think there was something something intrinsically interesting
00:04:19 about just seeing like where things break and did you all fly and see where they break did you take it to the
00:04:25 testing point like how did you know two minutes or was there a reckless let's just go with it and see we weren't very
00:04:32 good at BattleBots we lost all of our matches that woody first round like the one I built first both of them were
00:04:38 these wedge-shaped robots because a wedge even though it's sort of boring to look at is extremely effective you drive
00:04:43 towards another robot and the front edge of it gets under him and then they sort of flip over kind of like a door stopper
00:04:50 and the first one had a pneumatic polished stainless steel spike on the front that would shoot out about eight
00:04:55 inches the purpose of which is what pretty pretty ineffective actually but it looks cool and was it helpful to lift
00:05:02 no it was it was just to try to poke holes in the other robot and then the second time I did it which is the
00:05:08 following I think maybe 18 months later we had well a titanium axe with a with a hardened steel tip on it that was
00:05:17 powered by a hydraulic cylinder which we were activating with liquid co2 which was had its own set of problems so great so
00:05:25 that's kind of on the hardware side I mean at a certain point there must have been born a fascination on the software
00:05:34 side so what was the first piece of coal you've written go back there see what language was it what what was that was a
00:05:42 Emacs vim was it a more respectable modern ID do you remember any of this yeah well I remember I think maybe when
00:05:51 I was in third or fourth grade school I was at elementary school had a bunch of Apple 2 computers and we'd play games on
00:05:57 those and I remember every once in a while something mood would would crash it wouldn't start up correctly and it
00:06:03 would dump you out to what I later learned was like sort of a command prompt and my teacher would come over
00:06:08 and type actually remember this to this day for some reason like PR number six or PR pound six which is peripheral 6
00:06:14 which is the disk drive which would fire up the disk and load the program and I just remember thinking wow she's like a
00:06:19 hacker like teach me these these codes these error codes what I called him at the time but she had no interest in that
00:06:25 so it wasn't until I think about fifth grade that I had a school where you could actually go on these Apple twos
00:06:31 and learn to program and so it's all in basic you know where every line you know the line numbers are all number that
00:06:37 every line is numbered and you have to like leave enough space between the numbers so that if you want to tweak
00:06:42 your code you go back and the first line was 10 and the second line is 20 now you have to go back and insert and 15 and if
00:06:47 you need to add code in front of that you know 11 or 12 and you hope you don't run out of line numbers and have to redo
00:06:51 the whole thing there's go-to statements yeah go to and it's very basic maybe it's a name but a
00:07:00 lot of fun and that was like that was you know it's fun that's when you know when your first program you see the
00:07:04 magic of it it's like it just just like this world opens up with you know endless possibilities for the things you
00:07:09 could build or or accomplish with that computer so you got the bug then so even starting with basic and then what C++
00:07:16 throughout what did you it was a computer program in computer science classes in high school not not where I
00:07:23 went so it was a self-taught but I did a lot of programming the thing that you know sort of pushed me in the path
00:07:30 of eventually working on self-driving cars is actually one of these really long trips driving from my house in
00:07:38 Kansas to I think Las Vegas where we did the Battle Watts competition and I had just gotten my I think my learner's
00:07:45 permit or early driver's permit and so I was driving this you know 10 hour stretch across western Kansas where it's
00:07:51 just you're going straight on a highway and it is mind-numbing ly boring and I remember thinking even then with my sort
00:07:58 of mediocre programming background that this is something that a computer can do right let's take a picture of the road
00:08:02 let's find the yellow lane markers and you know steer the wheel and you know later I've come to realize this had been done
00:08:10 you know since since the 80s or the 70s or even earlier but I still wanted to do it and sort of immediately after that
00:08:16 trip switched from sort of BattleBots which is more radio-controlled machines to thinking about building you
00:08:23 know autonomous vehicles of some scale start off with really small electric ones and then you know progress to what
00:08:29 we're doing now so what was your view of artificial intelligence at that point what did you think so this is  before
00:08:35 there's been ways in artificial intelligence right the the current wave with deep learning makes people believe
00:08:42 that you can solve in a really rich deep way the computer vision perception problem but like in before the deep
00:08:52 learning craze you know how do you think about how would you even go about building a thing that perceives itself
00:08:57 in the world local as itself in the world moves around the world like when you were younger and yeah as what was
00:09:02 your thinking about it well prior to deep neural networks our convolutional neural as these modern techniques we
00:09:08 have or at least ones that are in use today it was all heuristic space and so like old-school image processing and I
00:09:15 think extracting you know yellow lane markers out of an image of a road is one of the problems that lends itself
00:09:23 reasonably well to those heuristic based methods you know like just do a threshold on the color yellow and then
00:09:28 try to fit some lines to that using a Hough transform or something and then go from there
00:09:33 traffic like detection and then stop signs detection red yellow green and I think you can you could I mean if you
00:09:40 wanted to do a full I was just trying to make thing that would stay in between the lanes on a highway but if you wanted to
00:09:48 do the full the full you know set of capabilities needed for a driverless car I think you could and we done this at
00:09:54 cruise you know in the very first days you can start off with a really simple you know human written heuristic just to
00:10:00 get the scaffolding in place for your system traffic light detection probably a really simple you know color threshold
00:10:06 injustice system up and running before you migrate to you know a deep learning based technique or something else and
00:10:12 you know back in when I was doing this my first one it was on Pentium 203 233 megahertz computer in it and I I think I
00:10:20 wrote the first version in basic which is like an interpreted language it's extremely slow because that's the thing
00:10:25 I knew at the time and so there was no no chance at all of using there was no computational power to do any sort of
00:10:33 reasonable deep nets like you have today so I don't know what kids these days are doing our kids these days you know at
00:10:38 age 13 using neural networks in their garage I mean I also I get emails all the time from you know like 11 12 year
00:10:46 old saying I'm having you know I'm trying to follow this tensorflow tutorial and I'm having this problem
00:10:54 and their general approach in the deep learning community is of extreme optimism of as opposed to you mentioned
00:11:03 like heuristics you can you can separate the autonomous driving problem into modules and try to solve it sort of
00:11:08 rigorously or you just do it end to end and most people just kind of love the idea that you know us humans do a tenth
00:11:15 and we just perceive and act we should be able to use that do the same kind of thing when you're on that's and that
00:11:21 that kind of thinking you don't want to criticize that kind of thinking because eventually they will be right yeah and
00:11:26 so it's exciting and especially when they're younger to explore that is a really exciting approach but yeah it's
00:11:35 it's changed the the language the kind of stuff you turned green with it it's kind of exciting to see when they
00:11:41 seniors grow up yeah I can only imagine if you if your starting point is you know Python and tensorflow at age 13
00:11:48 where you end up you know after 10 or 15 years of that that's that's pretty cool because of github because this
00:11:54 they're tools for solving most of the major problems and artificial intelligence are within a few lines of
00:12:01 code for most kids and that's incredible to think about also on the entrepreneurial side and and and at that
00:12:08 point was there any thought about entrepreneurship before you came to college is sort of doing your building
00:12:15 this into a thing that impacts the world on the large scale yeah I've always wanted to start a company I think that's
00:12:23 you know just a cool concept of creating something and exchanging it for value or creating value I guess so in high school
00:12:31 I was I was so trying to build like you know a servo motor drivers little circuit boards and sell them online or
00:12:37 other other things like that and certainly knew at some point I wanted to do a startup but it wasn't really I'd
00:12:43 say until college until I felt like I had the I guess the right combination of the
00:12:48 environment the smart people around you and some free time and a lot of free time at MIT so you came to MIT as an
00:12:57 undergrad 2004 that's right and that's when the first DARPA Grand Challenge was happening yeah the the timing of that is
00:13:04 beautifully poetic so how did you get yourself involved in that one originally there wasn't a official entry yeah
00:13:10 faculty sponsored thing and so a bunch of undergrads myself included I started meeting and got together and tried to
00:13:17 haggle together some sponsorships we got a vehicle donated a bunch of sensors and tried to put something together and so
00:13:24 we had our team was probably mostly freshmen and sophomores you know which was not really a fair fair fight against
00:13:31 maybe the you know postdoc and faculty-led teams from other schools but we we got something up and running we
00:13:37 had our vehicle drive by a wire and you know very very basic control and things but on the day of the qualifying for pre
00:13:48 qualifying round the one and only steering motor that we had purchased the thing that we had you know retrofitted
00:13:54 to turn the steering wheel on the truck died and so our vehicle was just dead in the water couldn't steer so we didn't
00:14:01 make it very far on the hardware side so was there a software component was there like how did your view of autonomous
00:14:06 vehicles in terms of artificial intelligence evolve in this moment I mean you know like you said from the 80s
00:14:14 has been autonomous vehicles but really that was the birth of the modern wave the the thing that captivated everyone's
00:14:20 imagination that we can actually do this so what how were you captivated in that way so how did your view of autonomous
00:14:29 vehicles change at that point I'd say at the curiosity as in like is this really possible and I think that was generally
00:14:41 the spirit and the the purpose of that original DARPA Grand Challenge which was to just get a whole bunch of really
00:14:48 brilliant people exploring the space and pushing the limits and and I think like to this day that DARPA challenge with
00:14:55 its you know million dollar prize pool was probably one of the most effective you know uses of taxpayer money dollar
00:15:03 for dollar that I've seen you know because that that small sort of initiative that DARPA put put out sort
00:15:11 of in my view was the catalyst or the tipping point for this this whole next wave of autonomous vehicle development
00:15:17 so that was pretty cool so let me jump around a little bit on that point they also did the urban challenge where I was
00:15:24 in the city but it was very artificial and there's no pedestrians and there's very little human involvement except a
00:15:31 few professional drivers yeah do you think there's room and then there was the Robotics Challenge with humanoid
00:15:37 robots right so in your now role is looking at this you're trying to solve one of the you know autonomous driving
00:15:43 one of the harder more difficult places of San Francisco is there a role for DARPA to step in to also kind of help
00:15:52 out they challenge with new ideas specifically a pedestrians and so on all these kinds of interesting things well I
00:15:57 haven't I haven't thought about it from that perspective is there anything DARPA could do today to further accelerate
00:16:03 things and I would say my instinct is that that's maybe not the highest and best use of their resources in time
00:16:09 because like kick starting and spinning up the flywheel is I think what what they did in this case for a very very
00:16:15 little money but today this has become this has become like commercially interesting to very large companies and
00:16:21 the amount of money going into it and the amount of people like going through your class and learning about these
00:16:26 things and developing these skills is just you know orders of magnitude more than it was back then and so there's
00:16:34 enough momentum and inertia and energy and investment dollars into this space right now that I don't I don't I think
00:16:41 they're I think they're they can just say mission accomplished and move on to the next area of technology that that
00:16:45 needs help so then stepping back to MIT you left on my teaching a junior year what was that
00:16:54 decision like as I said I always wanted to do a company in or start a company and this opportunity landed in my lap
00:17:02 which was a couple guys from Yale we're starting a new company and I googled them and found that they had started a
00:17:08 company previously and sold it actually on eBay for about a quarter million bucks which was a pretty interesting
00:17:14 story but so I thought to myself these guys are you know rock star entrepreneurs they've done this before
00:17:20 they must be driving around in Ferraris because they sold their company and you know I thought I could learn a lot from
00:17:27 them so I teamed up with those guys and you know went out during went out to California during IIP which is my tease
00:17:36 month off on one on one way ticket and basically never went back we were having so much fun we felt like we were
00:17:40 building something and creating something and it was going to be interesting that you know I was just all
00:17:47 in and got completely hooked and that that business was justin.tv which is originally a reality show about a guy
00:17:53 named Justin which morphed into a live video streaming platform which then morphed
00:18:00 into what is twitch today so that was that was quite a an unexpected journey so no regrets no looking back it was
00:18:08 just an obvious I mean one-way ticket I mean if we just pause on that for a second
00:18:16 there was no how did you know these were the right guys this is the right decision you didn't think it was just
00:18:22 follow the heart kind of thing well I didn't know but you know just trying something for a month during IEP he
00:18:28 seems pretty little risk right right and then you know well maybe I'll take a semester off and my teas pretty flexible
00:18:33 about that you can always go back right and then after two or three cycles of that I eventually threw in the towel but
00:18:42 I guess in that case I felt like I could always hit the undo button if I had to right but it never lasts from from when
00:18:50 you look in retrospect I mean it seems like a brave decision that you know it's difficult it would be difficult for a
00:18:54 lot of people to make it wasn't as popular I'd say that the general you know flux of people out of MIT at the
00:19:03 time was mostly into you know financier consulting jobs in Boston or New York and very few people were going to
00:19:09 California to start companies but today I'd say that's it's probably inverted which is just a sign of a sign of the
00:19:15 times I guess yeah so there's a story about midnight of March 18 2007 where whether we're
00:19:24 TechCrunch I guess and I was just in TV earlier than was supposed to a few hours the site didn't work I don't know if any
00:19:32 of this is true you can tell me and I you and one of the folks adjusted to e I'm a shear coated through the night can
00:19:41 you take me through that experience so let me let me say a few nice things that the article I read quoted Justin Kahn
00:19:49 said that you were known for mural coding through problems and being a creative quote creative genius so on
00:19:58 that night what was going through your head or maybe I put another way how do you solve these problems what's your
00:20:04 approach to solving these kinds of problems were the line between success and failure seems to be pretty thin
00:20:11 that's a good question well first of all that's that's a nice of Justin to say that I think you know I would have been
00:20:17 maybe twenty-one years old then and not very experienced at programming but as with with everything in a start-up
00:20:24 you're sort of racing against the clock and so our plan was the second we had this live streaming camera backpack up
00:20:33 and running where Justin could wear it and no matter where he went in a city it would be streaming live video and this
00:20:38 is even before the iPhones this is like hard to do back then we would launch and so we thought we were there and and the
00:20:46 backpack was working and then we sent out all the emails to launch the launch the company and do the press thing and
00:20:52 then you know we weren't quite actually there and then we thought oh well you know they're not going to announce it
00:21:00 until maybe 10 a.m. the next morning and it's I don't know it's 5 p.m. now so how many hours do we have left what is that
00:21:08 like you have 17 hours to go and and and that was that was gonna be fine was the problem obvious did you understand what
00:21:14 could possibly like how complicated was the system at that point it was it was pretty messy so to get a live video feed
00:21:23 that looked decent working from anywhere in San Francisco I put together the system where we had like three or four
00:21:30 cell phone data modems and they were like we take the video stream and you know sort of spray it across these three
00:21:36 or four modems and then try to catch all the packets on the other side you know with unreliable cell phone networks
00:21:42 pretty low level networking yeah and and putting his like you know sort of protocols on top of all that to
00:21:47 reassemble and reorder the packets and have time buffers and error correction and all that kind of stuff and the night
00:21:54 before it was just staticky every once in while the image would would go staticky and there would be this
00:22:00 horrible like screeching audio noise because the audio was also corrupted and this would happen like every five to ten
00:22:06 minutes or so and it was a really you know off-putting to the viewers how do you tackle that problem what was
00:22:12 the just freaking out behind a computer there's the word are there other other folks working on this problem like we
00:22:18 behind a whiteboard were you doing  yes a little hair coding it has a little only because there's four of us working
00:22:25 on the company and only two people really wrote code and Emmett wrote the website in the chat system and I wrote
00:22:31 the software for this video streaming device and video server and so I you know it's my sole responsibility to
00:22:38 figure that out yeah and I think I think it's those you know setting setting deadlines trying to move quickly and
00:22:43 everything where you're in that moment of intense pressure that sometimes people do their best and most
00:22:47 interesting work and so even though that was a terrible moment I look back on it fondly because that's like you know
00:22:52 that's one of those character defining moments I think so in 2013 October you founded cruise
00:23:01 automation yeah so progressing forward another exception successful company was acquired by GM in 16 for 1 billion
00:23:13 dollars but in October 2013 what was on your mind what was the plan how does one seriously start to tackle one of the
00:23:21 hardest robotics most important impact for robotics problems of our age after going through
00:23:29 twitch twitch was was and it is today pretty successful but the the work was the result was entertainment mostly like
00:23:39 the the better the product was the more we would entertain people and then you know make money on them ad revenues and
00:23:44 other things and that was that was a good thing it felt felt good to entertain people but I figured like you
00:23:49 know what is really the point of becoming a really good engineer and developing these skills other than you
00:23:54 know my own enjoyment and I realized I wanted something that scratched more of an existential itch like something that
00:24:00 that truly matters and so I basically made this list of requirements for a new if I was going to do another company and
00:24:07 the one thing I knew in the back of my head that twitch took like eight years to become successful and so whatever I
00:24:14 do I better be willing to commit you know at least ten years to something and when you think about things from that perspective
00:24:21 you certainly I think raised the bar on weight you choose to work on so for me the three things where it had to be
00:24:27 something where the technology itself determines the success of the product like hard really juicy technology
00:24:32 problems because that's what motivates me and then it had to have a direct and positive impact on society in some way
00:24:39 so an example would be like you know healthcare self-driving cars because they save lives other things where
00:24:43 there's a clear connection to somehow improving other people's lives and the last one is it had to be a big business
00:24:49 because for the positive impact to matter it's got to be a large scale scale yeah and I was thinking about that
00:24:54 for a while and I made like I tried writing a gmail clone and looked at some other ideas and then it just sort of
00:24:59 light bulb went off like self-driving cars like that was the most fun I had ever had in college working on that and
00:25:05 like well what's the state of the technology has been ten years maybe maybe times have changed and maybe now
00:25:11 is the time to make this work and I poked around and looked at the only other thing out there really at the time
00:25:15 was the Google self-driving car project and I thought surely there's a way to you know have an entrepreneur mindset
00:25:22 and sort of solve the Minimum Viable Product here and so I just took the plunge right then in there and said this
00:25:27 this is something I know I can commit ten years to it's the probably the greatest applied AI problem of our
00:25:32 generation it's right and if it works it's going to be both a huge business and therefore like probably the most
00:25:37 positive impact I can possibly have on the world so after that light bulb went off I went all in on crews immediately
00:25:46 and got to work did you have an idea how to solve this problem which aspect of the problem to solve you know slow like
00:25:53 what we just had Oliver for voyage here slow-moving retirement communities urban driving highway driving did you have
00:26:01 like did you have a vision of the city of the future or you know the transportation is largely automated that
00:26:10 kind of thing or was it sort of more fuzzy and gray area than that my analysis of the situation is that Google
00:26:17 is putting a lot it had been putting a lot of money into that project that a lot more resources and so
00:26:24 and they still hadn't cracked the fully driverless car you know this is 20 2013 I guess so I thought what what can I do
00:26:34 to sort of go from zero to you know significant scale so I can actually solve the real problem which is the
00:26:40 driverless cars and I thought here's the strategy we'll start by doing a really simple problem or solving a really
00:26:47 simple problem that creates value for people so eventually ended up deciding on automating highway driving which is
00:26:54 relatively more straightforward as long as there's a backup driver there and I'll you know the go-to-market will be
00:27:00 able retrofit people's cars and just sell these products directly and the idea was we'll take all the revenue and
00:27:07 profits from that and use it to do the social reinvest that in research for doing fully fabulous cars and that was
00:27:13 the plan the only thing that really changed along the way between then and now is we never
00:27:20 really launched the first product we had enough interest from investors in enough of a signal that this was something that
00:27:26 we should be working on that after about a year of working on the highway autopilot we had it working you know on
00:27:31 a prototype stage but we just completely abandoned that and said we're gonna go all in on driverless cars now is the
00:27:37 time can't think of anything that's more exciting and if it works more impactful so we're just gonna go for it the idea
00:27:43 of retrofit is kind of interesting yeah being able to it's how you achieve scale it's a really interesting idea is it's
00:27:49 something that's still in the in the back of your mind as a possibility not at all I've come full circle on that one
00:27:58 trying to build a retrofit product and I'll touch on some of the complexities of that and then also having been inside
00:28:05 in OEM and seeing how things work and how a vehicle is developed and validated when it comes to something that has
00:28:11 safety critical implications like controlling the steering and the other control inputs on your car it's pretty
00:28:17 hard to get there with with a retrofit or if you did even if you did it it creates a whole bunch of new
00:28:24 complications around liability or how did you truly validate that or you know something in the base vehicle fails and
00:28:29 causes your system to fail whose fault is it or if the cars anti-lock brake systems
00:28:35 or other things kick in or the software has been it's different in one version of the car you retrofit versus another
00:28:40 and you don't know because the manufacturer has updated it behind the scenes there's basically an infinite
00:28:46 list of longtail issues that can get you and if you're dealing with a safety critical product that's not really
00:28:50 acceptable that's a really convincing summary of why it's really challenging but I didn't at the time so we tried it
00:28:56 anyway but it's a pitch also at the time it's a really strong one yes that's how you achieve scale and that's how you
00:29:02 beat the current the the leader at the time of Google or the only one in the market the other big problem we ran into
00:29:08 which is perhaps the biggest problem from a business model perspective is we had kind of assumed that we'd we started
00:29:16 with an Audi s4 as the vehicle we retrofitted with his highway driving capability and we had kind of assumed
00:29:21 that if we just knock out like three make and models of vehicle that'll cover like eighty percent of a San Francisco
00:29:27 market doesn't everyone there drive I don't know a BMW or a Honda Civic or one of these three cars and then we surveyed
00:29:32 our users we found out that it's all over the place we would to get even a decent number of units sold we'd have to
00:29:38 support like you know 20 or 50 different models and each one is a little butterfly that takes time and effort to
00:29:44 maintain you know that retrofit integration and custom hardware and all this so is it there's a tough business
00:29:52 so GM manufactures and sells over nine million cars a year and what you with crews are trying to do some of the most
00:30:01 cutting-edge innovation in terms of applying AI and so hot out of those you've talked about a little bit before
00:30:07 but it's also just fascinating to me we'll work a lot of automakers you know the difference between the gap between
00:30:14 Detroit and Silicon Valley let's say just to be sort of poetic about it I guess what how do you close
00:30:20 that gap how do you take GM into the future where a large part of the fleet would be autonomous perhaps I want to
00:30:27 start by acknowledging that that GM is made up of you know tens of thousands of really brilliant motivated people who
00:30:33 want to be a part of the future and so it's pretty fun to work within the attitude inside a car company like that
00:30:40 is you know embracing this this transformation and change rather than fearing it and I
00:30:44 think that's a testament to the leadership at GM and that's flown all the way through to to everyone you talk
00:30:48 to even the people in this in blue plants working on these cars so that's really great so that starting from that
00:30:56 position makes a lot easier so then when the the people in San Francisco at Cruz interact with the people at GM at least
00:31:02 we have this common set of values which is that we really want this stuff to work because we think it's important and
00:31:08 we think it's the future not to say you know those two cultures don't clash they absolutely do there's
00:31:14 different different sort of value systems like in a car company the thing that gets you promoted and so the reward
00:31:22 system is following the processes delivering the the program on-time and on-budget so any sort of risk-taking is
00:31:32 discouraged in many ways because if a program is late or if you shut down the plant for a day it's you know you can
00:31:38 count the millions of dollars that burn by pretty quickly whereas I think you know most Silicon Valley companies and
00:31:47 crews in the methodology we were employing especially around the time of the acquisition the reward structure is
00:31:54 about trying to solve these complex problems in any way shape or form or coming up with crazy ideas that you know
00:32:01 90% of them won't work and and so so meshing that culture of sort of continuous improvement and
00:32:06 experimentation with one where everything needs to be you know rigorously defined upfront so that you
00:32:11 never slip a deadline or miss a budget was a pretty big challenge and that we're over three years in now after the
00:32:19 acquisition and I'd say like you know the investment we made in figuring out how to work together successfully and
00:32:26 who should do what and how we bridge the gaps between these very different systems and way of doing engineering
00:32:30 work is now one of our greatest assets because I think we have this really powerful thing but for a while it was
00:32:36 both both GM and crews were very steep on the learning curve yes I'm sure it was very stressful it's really important
00:32:42 work because that's that's how to revolutionize the transportation it really to revolutionize any system you
00:32:48 know you look at the healthcare system or you look at the legal system I have people like lawyers come up to me all
00:32:53 the time like everything they're working on can easily be automated but then that's not a good feeling yeah that was
00:33:00 it's not a good feeling but also there's no way to automate because the the the entire infrastructure is really you know
00:33:08 based is older and it moves very slowly and so how do you close the gap between I haven't how can I replace of course
00:33:15 lawyers don't wanna be replaced with an app but you could replace a lot of aspect when most of the data is still on paper
00:33:21 and so the same thing was with automotive I mean it's fundamentally software so it's is basically hiring
00:33:29 software engineers it's thinking a software world I mean I'm pretty sure nobody in Silicon Valley's ever hit a
00:33:36 deadline so and then it's probably true yeah and GSI is probably the opposite yeah so that's that culture gap is
00:33:43 really fascinating so you're optimistic about the future of that yeah I mean from what I've seen it's impressive and
00:33:49 I think like especially in Silicon Valley it's easy to write off building cars because you know people have been
00:33:54 doing that for over a hundred years now in this country and so it seems like that's a solved problem but that doesn't
00:34:00 mean it's an easy problem and I think it would be easy to sort of overlook that and think that you know we're Silicon
00:34:07 Valley engineers we can solve any problem you know building a car it's been done therefore it's you know it's
00:34:12 it's it's not it's not a real engineering challenge but after having seen just the sheer scale and magnitude
00:34:21 and industrialization that occurs inside of an automotive assembly plant that is a lot of work that I am very glad that
00:34:28 we don't have to reinvent to make self-driving cars work and so to have you know partners who have done that for
00:34:32 a hundred years now these great processes and this huge infrastructure and supply base that we can tap into is
00:34:41 just remarkable because the scope in surface area of the problem of deploying fleets of self-driving cars is so large
00:34:48 that we're constantly looking for ways to do less so we can focus on the things that really matter more and if we had to
00:34:57 figure out how to build an assemble in you know test and build the cars themselves I mean we work closely with
00:35:02 Jim on that but if we had to develop all that capability in-house as well you know that that would just make make the
00:35:09 problem really intractable I think mmm so yeah just like your first entry mit DARPA challenge when there was what the
00:35:18 motor that failed and somebody that knows what they're doing with the motor did it that would have been nice if you
00:35:22 focus on the software and not the hardware platform yeah right so from your perspective now you know there's so
00:35:30 many ways that autonomous vehicles can impact Society in the next year five years ten years what do you think is the
00:35:38 biggest opportunity to make money in autonomous driving sort of make it a financially viable thing in the
00:35:45 near-term what do you think would be the biggest impact there well the things that that drive the economics for fleets
00:35:54 of self-driving cars or they're sort of a handful of variables one is you know the cost to build the vehicle itself so
00:36:02 the material cost how many you know what's the cost of all your sensors plus the cost of the vehicle and every all
00:36:07 the other components on it another one is the lifetime of the vehicle it's very different if your vehicle drives one
00:36:12 hundred thousand miles and then it falls apart versus you know two million and then you know if you have a fleet
00:36:21 it's kind of like an airplane where or airline where once you produce the vehicle you want it to be in operation
00:36:28 as many hours a day as possible producing revenue and then a you know the other piece of that is how are you
00:36:35 generating revenue I think that's kind what you're asking and I think the obvious things today are you know the
00:36:40 ride-sharing business because that's pretty clear that there's demand for that there's existing markets you can
00:36:47 tap into and larger urban areas that kind of thing yeah yeah and and and I think that there are some real benefits
00:36:54 to having cars without drivers compared to through the status quo for people who use ride share services today you know
00:37:00 you get privacy consistency hopefully significant improve safety all these benefits versus the current
00:37:06 product but it's it's a crowded market and then other opportunities which you've seen a lot of activity in the
00:37:10 last really in last six to twelve months is you know delivery whether that's parcels and packages food or or
00:37:19 groceries those are all sort of I think opportunities that are that are pretty ripe for these you know once you have
00:37:26 this core technology which is the fleet of autonomous vehicles there's all sorts of different business opportunities you
00:37:32 can build on top of that but I think the important thing of course is that there's zero monetization opportunity
00:37:37 until you actually have that fleet of very capable driverless cars that are that are as good or better than humans
00:37:43 and that's sort of where the entire industry is sort of in this holding pattern right now yeah the trend
00:37:48 achieved that baseline so but you said sort of rely not reliability consistency it's kind of interesting I think I heard
00:37:54 you say somewhere I'm not sure if that's what you meant but you know I can imagine a situation where you would get
00:38:02 an autonomous vehicle and you know when you get into an uber or lyft you don't get to choose the driver in a
00:38:07 sense that you don't get to choose the personality of the driving do you think there's a there's room to define the
00:38:14 personality of the car the way drives you in terms of aggressiveness for example in terms of sort of pushing the
00:38:22 bomb the one of the biggest challenges in Toms driving is the is a trade-off between sort of safety and
00:38:30 and do you think there's any room for the human to take a role in that decision to accept the liability I guess
00:38:39 we III wouldn't it no I'd say within reasonable bounds as in we're not gonna I think it'd be highly unlikely we did
00:38:46 expose any nob that would let you you know significantly increase safety risk I think that's that's just not something
00:38:54 we'd be willing to do but I think driving style or like you know are you gonna relax the comfort constraints
00:39:00 slightly or things like that all of those things make sense and are plausible I see all those is you know
00:39:05 nice optimizations once again we get the core problem solved and these fleets out there but the other thing we've sort of
00:39:12 observed is that you have this intuition that if you sort of slam your foot on the gas right after the light turns
00:39:18 green and aggressively accelerate you're gonna get there faster but the actual impact of doing that is pretty small you
00:39:23 feel like you're getting there faster but so that so the same would be true for ABS even if they don't slam there
00:39:29 you know the pedal to the floor when the light turns green they're gonna get you they're within you know if it's a
00:39:34 15-minute trip within 30 seconds of what you would have done otherwise if you were going really aggressively so I
00:39:39 think there's this sort of self-deception that that my aggressive driving style is getting me there faster
00:39:45 well so that's you know some of the things I study some things I'm fascinated by the psychology of that I
00:39:51 don't think it matters that it doesn't get you there faster it's it's the emotional release driving is is a place
00:39:59 being inside or a car somebody said it's like the real world version of being a troll so you have this protection this
00:40:05 mental protection you're able to sort of yell at the world like release your anger whatever is but so there's an
00:40:11 element of that that I think autonomous vehicles would also have to you know have giving an outlet to people but it
00:40:17 doesn't have to be through through through driving or honking or so on there might be other outlets but I think
00:40:23 to just sort of even just put that aside the baseline is really you know that's the focus that's the thing you need to
00:40:29 solve and then the fun human things can be solved after but so from the baseline of just solving autonomous driving and
00:40:36 you're working in San Francisco one of the more difficult cities to operate in what what is what is the any of you currently
00:40:45 the hardest aspect of autonomous driving and negotiated with pedestrians is that edge cases of perception is it planning
00:40:54 is there a mechanical engineering is it data fleet stuff like what are your thoughts on the challenge the more challenging
00:41:01 aspects there that's a good that's a good question I think before before we go to that though I just wanted I like
00:41:06 what you said about the psychology aspect of this because I think one observation I made is I think I read
00:41:11 somewhere that I think it's maybe Americans on average spend you know over an hour a day on social media like
00:41:18 staring at Facebook and so that's just you know 60 minutes of your life you're not getting back and it's probably not
00:41:24 super productive and so that's 3,600 seconds right and that's that's time you know it's a lot of time you're giving up
00:41:32 and if you compare that to people being on the road if another vehicle whether it's a human driver or autonomous
00:41:38 vehicle delays them by even three seconds they're laying in on the horn you know even though that's that's you
00:41:44 know one one thousandth of the time they waste looking at Facebook every day so there's there's definitely some you know
00:41:50 psychology aspects of this I think that are pre interesting road rage in general and then the question of course is if
00:41:55 everyone is in self-driving cars do they even notice these three-second delays anymore because they're doing other
00:42:00 things or reading or working or just talking to each other so it'll be interesting to see where that goes
00:42:05 in a certain aspect people people need to be distracted by something entertaining something useful inside the
00:42:10 car so they don't pay attention to the external world and then and then and it can take whatever psychology and bring
00:42:17 it back to Twitter and then focus on that as opposed to sort of interacting sort of putting the emotion out there
00:42:23 into the world so it's a it's an interesting problem but baseline autonomy I guess you could say
00:42:29 self-driving cars you know at scale will lower the collective blood pressure of society probably by a couple points yeah
00:42:35 without all that road rage and stress so that's a good good externality so back to your question about the technology in
00:42:43 the the I guess the biggest problems and I have a hard time answering that question because you know we've been at this
00:42:50 like specifically focusing on driverless cars and all the technology needed to enable that for a little over four and a
00:42:57 half years now and even a year or two in I felt like we had completed the functionality needed to
00:43:04 get someone from point A to point B as in if we need to do a left turn maneuver or if we need to drive around a you know
00:43:10 a double parked vehicle into oncoming traffic or navigate through construction zones the the scaffolding and the building
00:43:17 blocks where it was there pretty early on and so the challenge is not any one scenario or situation for which you know
00:43:26 we fail at 100% of those it's more you know we're benchmarking against a pretty good or pretty high standard which is
00:43:32 human driving all things considered humans are excellent at handling the edge cases and unexpected scenarios
00:43:38 whereas computers the opposite and so beating that that baseline set by humans is the challenge and so what we've been
00:43:46 doing for quite some time now is basically it's this continuous improvement process where we find sort of the the most you
00:43:56 know uncomfortable or the things that that could lead to a safety issue other things all these events and then we sort
00:44:04 of categorize them and rework parts of our system to make incremental improvements and do that over and over
00:44:09 and over again and we just see sort of the overall performance of the system you know actually increasing in a pretty
00:44:15 steady clip but there's no one thing there's actually like thousands of little things and just like polishing
00:44:20 functionality and making sure that it handles you know every version impossible permutation of a situation by
00:44:28 either applying more deep learning systems or just by you know adding more tests coverage or new scenarios that
00:44:36 that we develop against and just grinding on that it's we're sort of in the the unsexy phase of development
00:44:41 right now which is doing the real engineering work that it takes to go from prototype to production
00:44:45 you're basically scaling the the grinding so has sort of taking seriously that the process of all those edge cases
00:44:54 both with human experts and machine learning methods to cover to cover all those situations yeah and the exciting
00:45:01 thing for me is I don't think that grinding ever stops right because there's a moment in time where you you
00:45:08 cross that threshold of human performance and become superhuman but there's no reason there's no first
00:45:15 principles reason that AV capability will tap out anywhere near humans like there's no reason it couldn't be 20
00:45:21 times better whether that's you know just better driving or safer driving a more comfortable driving or even a
00:45:26 thousand times better given enough time and we intend to basically chase that you know forever to build the best
00:45:33 possible product better and better and better and always new educators come up and you experiences so and you want to
00:45:39 automate that process as much as possible mhm so what do you think in general in society when do you think we
00:45:48 may have hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous vehicles driving around so first of all predictions nobody knows
00:45:54 the future you're a part of the leading people trying to define that future but even then you still don't know but if
00:46:01 you think about a hundreds of thousands of heat so a significant fraction of vehicles in
00:46:07 major cities are autonomous do you think I would Rodney Brooks who is 2050 and beyond are you more with Elon Musk who
00:46:19 is we should have had that two years ago well I mean I don't want me to have it two years ago but we're not there yet so
00:46:28 I guess the the way I would think about that is let's let's flip that question around so what would prevent you to
00:46:35 reach hundreds of thousands of vehicles and that's a goodness a good rephrasing among the
00:46:49 people developing self-driving cars today is to sort of start with some form of an easier environment whether it
00:46:55 means you know lacking inclement weather or you know mostly sunny or whatever it is and then add add capability for more
00:47:05 complex situations over time and so if you're only able to deploy in areas that that meet sort of your criteria or that
00:47:13 the current domain you know operating domain of the software you developed that may put a cap on how many cities
00:47:18 you could deploy in but then as those restrictions start to fall away like maybe you add you know
00:47:24 capability to drive really well and and safely in heavy rain or snow you know that that probably opens up the market
00:47:30 by - two or three fold in terms of the cities you can expand into and so on and so the real question is you know I I
00:47:37 know today if we wanted to we could produce that that many autonomous vehicles but we wouldn't be able to make
00:47:42 use of all of them yet because we would sort of saturate the demand in the cities in which we would want to operate
00:47:49 initially so if I were to guess like what the timeline is for those things falling away and reaching hundreds of
00:47:56 thousands of vehicles maybe a range is but I would I would say less than five years that's in five years yeah and of
00:48:01 course you're working hard to make that happen so you started two companies that were eventually acquired for each for a
00:48:10 billion dollars so you're pretty good person to ask what does it take to build a successful startup mmm-hmm I think
00:48:17 there's there sort of survivor bias here a little bit but I can try to find some common threads for the the things that
00:48:26 you know in in both of these companies it was really passionate about the core technology I actually like you know lay
00:48:31 awake at night thinking about these problems and how to solve them and I think that's helpful because when you
00:48:38 start a business there are like to this day they're they're these crazy ups and downs like one day you think the
00:48:42 business is just on you're just on top of the world and unstoppable and the next day you think okay this is all
00:48:47 gonna and you know it's it's just it's just going south and it's gonna be over tomorrow and and so I think like having
00:48:55 a true passion that you can fall back on and knowing that you would be doing it even if you weren't getting paid for it
00:48:59 helps you whether those those tough times so that's one thing I think the really good people so I've always been
00:49:07 surrounded by really good co-founders that are logical thinkers are always pushing their limits and have very high
00:49:13 levels of integrity so that's Dan Khan in my current company and actually his brother and a couple other guys for
00:49:20 Justin TV and twitch and then I think the last thing is just  I guess persistence or
00:49:27 perseverance like and and that that can apply to sticking to sort of a or having conviction around the original premise
00:49:34 of your idea and and sticking around to do all the you know the unsexy work to actually make it come to fruition
00:49:41 including dealing with you know whatever it is that that you're not passionate about whether that's finance or or HR or
00:49:48 or operations or those things as long as you are grinding away in working towards you know that North Star for your
00:49:54 business whatever it is and you don't give up and you're making progress every day it seems like eventually you'll end
00:49:59 up in a good place and the only things that can slow you down are you know running out of money or I suppose your
00:50:03 competitors destroying you but I think most of the time it's people giving up or or somehow destroying things
00:50:09 themselves rather than being beaten by their competition or running out of money yeah if you never quit eventually
00:50:13 you'll arrive so working size version of what I was trying to say yeah so you want the Y
00:50:22 Combinator out twice yeah what do you think in a quick question do you think is the best way to raise funds in the
00:50:29 early days or not just funds but just community develop your idea and so on can you do it solo or maybe with a
00:50:39 co-founder with like self-funded do you think Y Combinator is good it's good to do VC route is there no right answer was
00:50:45 there for the Y Combinator experience something that you could take away that that was the right path to take there's
00:50:50 no one-size-fits-all answer but if your ambition I think is to you know see how big you can make something or or or
00:50:58 rapidly expand and capture market or solve a problem or whatever it is then then you know going to venture back
00:51:04 route is probably a good approach so that so that capital doesn't become your primary constraint Y Combinator I love
00:51:12 because it puts you in this sort of competitive environment while you're where you're surrounded by you know the
00:51:17 top maybe one percent of other really highly motivated you know peers who are in the same same place and that that
00:51:25 environment I think just breeds breed success right if you're surrounded by really brilliant hard-working people
00:51:31 you're gonna feel you know sort of compelled or inspired to try to emulate them and/or beat them and so even though
00:51:38 I had done it once before and I felt like yeah I'm pretty self-motivated I thought like I look this is gonna be a
00:51:43 hard problem I can use all the help I can get so surrounding myself with other entrepreneurs is gonna make me work a
00:51:49 little bit harder or push a little harder than it's worth it when Saba white why I did it you know for example
00:51:55 a second time let's let's go philosophical existential if you'd go back and do something differently in
00:52:03 your life starting in high school than MIT leaving MIT you could have gone the PG route doing startup I'm gonna see
00:52:13 about a start-up in California and youth or maybe some aspects of fundraising is there something you'll regret
00:52:19 something you need not necessarily grab but if you go back it could do differently I think I've made a lot of
00:52:24 mistakes like you know pretty much everything you can screw up I think I've screwed up at least once but I you know
00:52:31 I don't regret those things I think it's hard to hard to look back on things even if they didn't go well and call it a
00:52:36 regret because hopefully took away some I would say there was a period yeah the closest I can I can come to us is
00:52:49 there's a period in in justin.tv I think that the company was going one direction which is sorts twitch in video gaming
00:52:59 and I'm not a video gamer I don't really even use twitch at all and I was still working on the core technology there but
00:53:06 my heart was no longer in it because the business that we were creating was not something that I was personally
00:53:10 passionate about it didn't meet your bar of existential impact yeah and I'd say III probably spent an extra year or two
00:53:19 working on that and and I'd say like I would have just tried to do something different sooner because those are those
00:53:26 were two years where I felt like you know from this philosophical or existential thing I I just I just felt
00:53:32 something was missing and so I would have I would have if I could look back now and tell myself it's like I would
00:53:36 have said exactly that like you're not getting any meaning out of your work personally right now you should you
00:53:41 should find a way to change that and that's part of the pitch I use to basically everyone who joins crews today
00:53:47 it's like hey you've got that now by coming here well maybe you needed the two years of
00:53:51 that existential dread to develop the feeling that ultimately was the fire that created crews so you never know you
00:53:58 can be good theory yeah so last question what does 2019 hold for crews after this I guess we're gonna go and I'll talk to
00:54:05 your class but one of the big things is going from prototype to production for autonomous cars and what does that mean
00:54:12 once that look like in 2019 for us is the year that we try to cross over that threshold and reach
00:54:17 you know superhuman level of performance to some degree with the software and have all the other of the thousands of
00:54:23 little building blocks in place to launch you know our first commercial product so that's that's what's in score
00:54:30 for us are in store for us and we've got a lot of work to do we've got a lot of brilliant people working on it so it's
00:54:39 it's all up to us now yeah from Charlie Miller and Chris fells like the people I have crossed paths with if you know it
00:54:45 sounds like you have an amazing team so I'm like I said it's one of the most I think one of the most important problems
00:54:51 in artificial intelligence of the century you'll be one of the most defining the super exciting that you
00:54:59 work on it and the best of luck in 2019 I'm really excited to see what Cruz comes up with thank you thanks for
