00:00:02 the following is a conversation with an Julianne writer producer director and one of the most important and impactful
00:00:10 communicators of science in our time she co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan whom
00:00:19 she married in 1981 and her love for whom with the help of NASA was recorded as brainwaves on a golden record along
00:00:27 with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that
00:00:36 are now 42 years later still active reaching out farther into deep space than any human made object ever has this
00:00:45 was a profound and beautiful decision and made as a creative director of NASA's Voyager interstellar message
00:00:53 project in 2014 she went on to create the second season of cosmos called cosmos and spacetime Odyssey and in 2020
00:01:02 the new third season called cosmos possible worlds which is being released this upcoming Monday March 9th it is
00:01:11 hosted once again by the fun and the brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson Carl Sagan Annie Julian and cosmos have inspired
00:01:20 millions of scientists and curious minds across several generations by revealing the magic the power the beauty of
00:01:30 science I am one such curious mind and if you listen to this podcast you may know that Elon Musk is as well he
00:01:37 graciously agreed to read Carl Sagan's words about the pale blue dot in my second conversation with him if you
00:01:44 listened there was an interesting and inspiring twist at the end this is the artificial intelligence
00:01:51 podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it five stars an apple podcast supported on patreon
00:01:58 I'll connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri DM aen as usual I'll do one or two minutes of ads now
00:02:07 and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt
00:02:12 the listening experience this shows presented by cash app the number one finance app in the App Store
00:02:20 when you get it use collects podcast cash app lets you send money to friends buy Bitcoin and invest in the stock
00:02:27 market with as little as one dollar since cash app allows you to send and receive money digitally peer-to-peer and
00:02:35 security in all digital transactions it's very important let me mention the PCI data security standard that cash app
00:02:42 is compliant with I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security PCI DSS is a good example of that where a
00:02:49 bunch of competitors got together and agreed that there needs to be a global standard around the security of
00:02:56 transactions now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems in
00:03:03 general so again if you get cash app from the App Store Google Play and use the code let's podcast you get ten
00:03:10 dollars and cash up will also donate ten dollars the first one of my favorite organizations that's helping to advance
00:03:17 robotics and STEM education for young people around the world and now here's my conversation with Ann Julianne what
00:03:26 is the role of Science in our society well I think of what Einstein said when he opened the 1939 New York World's Fair
00:03:39 he said if science is ever to fulfill its mission the way art has done it must penetrate its inner meaning must
00:03:51 penetrate the consciousness of everyone and so for me especially in a civilization dependent on high
00:04:01 technology and science one that spires to be democratic it's critical that the public has informed decision
00:04:13 makers understand the values and the methods and the rules of science so you think about the what you just mentioned
00:04:23 the values and the methods and the rules and maybe the technology that science produces but what about sort of the
00:04:32 beauty the mystery of science well that you've touched on what I think is for me that's how my way into science is that
00:04:40 for me it's much more spiritually uplifting the revelations of science collective revelations of you know
00:04:50 really countless generations of searchers and a little tiny bit we know about reality is the greatest joy from
00:05:00 me because I think it relates to the idea of love like what is love that is based on illusion about the other that's
00:05:12 not love love is seeing unflinching the other and accepting with all your heart and to me knowing the universe as it is
00:05:20 or the little bit that we're able to understand at this point is like is the purest kind of love and therefore you
00:05:29 know how can our philosophy our religion if it's real isn't nature how can it really be true I just don't understand
00:05:40 so I think you need science to get a sense of the real romance of life and the great experience of being awake in
00:05:52 the cosmos so that the fact that we know so little the the humbling nature of that so and you kind of connect the love
00:06:02 to that but isn't it also isn't it scary isn't it why is it so inspiring do you think why is it so beautiful that we
00:06:10 know so little well first of all as Socrates thought you know knowing that you know
00:06:17 is knowing really knowing something knowing more than others and it's the it's that voice whispering in our our
00:06:26 heads you know you might be wrong which i think is not only it's really healthy because we're so imperfect we're human
00:06:35 of course but also you know love to me is the feeling that you always want to go deeper get closer you can't get
00:06:43 enough of it you can't get close enough deep enough so and that's what science is always saying as science is never
00:06:51 simply content with its understanding of any aspect of nature it's always saying it's always finding that even smaller
00:07:02 cosmos beneath so I I think the two are very much parallel so you said that love is not an illusion no it's not well what
00:07:15 is love what is love is is knowing for me love is is knowing something deeply and still being completely gratified by
00:07:28 it you know and wanting to know more so what is love what is loving someone a person let's say deeply is not
00:07:41 idealizing them not putting some kind of subjective projection on them but knowing them as they are and so for me
00:07:52 for me the only aperture to that knowing about nature the universe it's science because it has that error
00:07:59 correcting mechanism that most of the stuff that we do doesn't have you know you could say the Bill of Rights is kind
00:08:06 of an error correcting mechanism which I it's one of the things I really appreciate about this society in which I
00:08:14 live to the extent that it's upheld and we keep faith with it and the same with science it's like we will give you the
00:08:22 highest rewards we have for proving us wrong about something that's genius that's that's why
00:08:33 that's why in only 400 years since Galileo's first look through a telescope we could get from this really dim fake
00:08:45 this big apprehension of another world to sending our eyes and our senses there or even going beyond so it is it is it
00:08:57 delivers the goods like nothing else you know it really it delivers the goods because it's always it's always
00:09:08 self-aware of its ability I'm not topic I'd like to ask your opinion and a feeling I have that I'm not sure what to
00:09:16 do with which is the the sceptical aspect of science so the modern skeptics community and just in general certain
00:09:24 scientists many scientists maybe most scientists that apply the scientific method are kind of rigorous in that
00:09:32 application and they it feels like sometimes miss out some of the ideas outside the reach of just slightly
00:09:37 outside of the reach of science and they don't dare to sort of dream or think of revolutionary ideas that others will
00:09:45 call crazy in this particular moment how do you think about the skeptical aspect of science that is really good at sort
00:09:52 of keeping us in check keeping us humble but but at the same time sort of the kind of dreams that you and Carl Sagan
00:10:00 have inspired in the world it kind of shuts it down sometimes a little bit yeah I mean I think it's up to the
00:10:07 individual but for me no I was so ridiculously fortunate and that I my tutorial in science because I'm not a
00:10:14 scientist and I wasn't trained in science was 20 years of days and nights with Carl Sagan and the Wonder I think
00:10:24 the reason Carl remains so beloved well I think there are many reasons but at the root of it is the fact that his
00:10:32 skepticism was never at the cost of his Wonder and his Wonder was never at the cost of his skepticism so he couldn't
00:10:41 fool himself into believing something he wanted to believe because it made him feel good at the
00:10:46 other but on the other hand he recognized that what science what nature is it's really it's good enough you know
00:10:57 it's way better than our fantasies yeah and so if you if you're that kind of person who loves happiness loves life
00:11:06 and your eyes are wide open and you read everything you can get your hands on and you spend years studying what is known
00:11:15 so far about the universe then you have that capacity a really infinite capacity to be alive but all and also at the same
00:11:27 time to be very rigorous about what you're willing to believe for Carl I don't think he ever felt that his
00:11:35 skepticism cost him anything because again it comes back to luck he wanted to know when HM really was like not to
00:11:44 inflict his you know preconceived notions on what he wanted it to be so you can't go wrong because it doesn't
00:11:51 you know I mean you know I think the pale blue dot is that is a perfect example of this of his massive
00:12:02 achievement is to say ok or the Voyager record is another example is here we have this mission our first
00:12:08 reconnaissance of the outer solar system well how can we make it a mission in which we absolutely squeeze every drop
00:12:21 of consciousness and understanding from it we don't have to be scientists and then be human beings I think that's the
00:12:30 tragedy of Western civilization is that it's you know when it's one of its greatest gifts it has been science and
00:12:41 yet at the same time it believing that we are the children of a disappointed father a tyrant who puts us in a
00:12:50 maximum-security prison and calls it paradise who looks at us who watches us every moment and hates us for
00:13:00 being our human selves you know and then most of all what is our great sin its partaking of the tree of knowledge which
00:13:09 is our greatest gift as humans this pattern recognition this ability to to see things and then synthesize them and
00:13:19 jump to conclusions about them and test those conclusions so I think the reason that in literature in movies the
00:13:31 scientist is a figure of alienation a figure you know oh you see these biopics about scientists and yeah he might have
00:13:40 been great but you know he was missing and ship you know he was a lousy husband he lacked you know the kind of spiritual
00:13:51 understanding that maybe you know his wife had and it's always in the end they come around but to me that's that's a
00:14:01 false dichotomy that we are you know to the extent that we are aware of our surroundings and understand them which
00:14:07 is what science makes it possible for us to do we're even more alive so you mentioned a million awesome things there
00:14:16 let's even just can you tell me about the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft and the and the interstellar message project and
00:14:23 that whole just fascinating world leading up to one of my favorite subjects I love talking about it I'll
00:14:28 never get over it yeah I'll never be able to really wrap my head around the the reality of it the
00:14:36 truth of it what is it for so what's the Voyager spacecraft okay so voyagers 1 & 2 where our first
00:14:43 reconnaissance mission of what was then considered the outer solar system and it was a gift of gravity the idea that
00:14:54 swinging around these worlds gives you a gravitational assist yes which ultimately will send you out of
00:15:02 the solar system to wander the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion years so Voyager gave us our
00:15:14 first close-up look of Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune it's discovered new moons it discovered volcanoes on Io it it its
00:15:31 achievements are astonishing and remember this is technology from the early to mid-1970s and it's still active
00:15:39 and it's still active we talked to Voyager a few days ago we talked to it in fact a year ago I think it was we
00:15:49 needed to slightly change the attitude of the spacecraft and so we fired up its thrusters for the first time since 1987
00:15:59 do they work instantly they it was as if you had left your car in the garage in 1987 yeah and you could key in the
00:16:07 ignition because you use keys then in the ignition and it turned over the first time you stepped on the gas and so
00:16:14 that's the genius of the engineering yeah a Voyager and Carl was one of the key participants in in in imagining what
00:16:26 its mission would be because it was a a gift actually of the fact that every hundred and 75 years plus or minus there
00:16:37 is an alignment of the worlds and so you can't send two spacecraft to these are the worlds and photograph them and use
00:16:46 your mass spectrometer and all the other devices unvoyage ER to to really to explore these worlds and it's the
00:16:56 farthest spacecraft is the farthest human creation away from us today where is your one where's your one these two
00:17:05 spacecraft not only gave us a our first close-up look hundreds of moons and planets these four giant these planets
00:17:16 but also it told us the shape of the solar system as it moves through the galaxy because there were two of them
00:17:23 going in different directions and they finally and they arrived in a place called the heliopause which is
00:17:30 where the wind from the Sun the solar wind dies down and the interstellar medium begins and both voyagers were the
00:17:38 first spacecraft that we had they could tell us when that happened so it's a consummate I think it's the greatest
00:17:49 scientific achievement of the 20th century and engineering in some sense engineering I mean really you know
00:17:57 voyagers and Voyager is doing this on less energy than you have in your toaster something like 11 watts so ok
00:18:06 but because of this gravitational assist both voyagers were destined as I say to they were just they were personal they
00:18:14 were supposed to function for a dozen years and now it's 42 years since launch and we're still talking to them so
00:18:21 that's amazing but prior to launch almost a year eight nine months prior to launch it was
00:18:33 decided that since Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and Linda sauceman Sagan had created something called the Pioneer 10
00:18:41 plaque for the Pioneer spacecraft that preceded Voyager which was kind of like a license plate for the planet Earth you
00:18:50 know a man and a woman hands up you know very very basic but very effective and it captured the imagination of people
00:19:01 all over the world and so NASA turn to Frank and to Carl and said we'd like you to do a message for Voyager
00:19:12 because if it's going to be circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion years you know
00:19:20 it's like 20 trips around the galaxy and there's a very small chance that a spacefaring civilization would be able
00:19:30 to flag one of them down and so on board you see this exquisite golden disc with scientific hieroglyphics explaining our
00:19:42 address and various basic scientific concepts that we believe that would be common to any spacefaring civilization
00:19:53 and then beneath this exquisite golden disc is the Voyager record the golden record and it contains something like
00:20:09 118 photographs images of life on Earth as well as 27 pieces of music from all around the world many people describe it
00:20:22 as the invention of world music world music was not a concept that existed before the Voyager record and we were
00:20:30 determined to take our music not just from the dominant technical cultures but from all of the rich cultural heritage
00:20:40 of the earth and there's a sound essay which is kind of using using a microphone as a camera to tell the story
00:20:51 of the earth beginning with its geological sounds and moving into biology and then into technology and
00:21:02 likes I think what you were getting at is that at the end of this sound essay I had asked Carl if it were in the making
00:21:14 of the record it was my honor to be the creative director of the project if it was possible to if I had
00:21:23 meditated for an hour while I was hooked up so that you know every single signal it was coming from my brain my body was
00:21:37 recorded and then converted into into sound for the record was it possible that these putative extraterrestrials of
00:21:44 the distant future of perhaps the billion years from now would be able to reconstitute this message and to
00:21:58 understand it and he just big smile and so I did this and what were you thinking about in the meditation like what I mean
00:22:06 it's such an interesting idea of recording as you think about things what were you thinking about so I was
00:22:16 blindfolded and couldn't hear anything and I had made an a mental itinerary of exactly where I wanted to go I was truly
00:22:31 humbled by the idea that these thoughts could conceivably touch the distant future that's incredible so it's 1977 there are
00:22:40 some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the planet the Soviet Union and the United States are engaged in a you know to the
00:22:52 death competition and so I began by trying to tell the history of the planet in you know to my limited ability what I
00:23:04 understood about the story of the early existence of the war of the planet about the origin of life about the evolution
00:23:14 of life about our the history of humans about our current at that time predicament about the fact that one in
00:23:26 five of us was starving  or unable to get potable water and so I sort of gave a kind of you know
00:23:36 it's general a picture as I possibly could of our predicament and I also I was Perry newly within days
00:23:50 of the moment when Carl and I fell in love with each other maybe we fell in love with each other long before because
00:23:55 we'd known each other for years but it was the first time we had expressed our feelings for each other acknowledged did
00:24:02 the existence of this yes because we're both involved with other people and it was a completely outside his morality in
00:24:14 mine to even broach the subject but it was only days after that it happened and for me it was a Eureka moment it was in
00:24:24 the context of finding that piece of Chinese music that was worthy to represent one of the oldest musical
00:24:33 traditions on earth when those of us who worked on the Voyager record were completely ignorant about Chinese music
00:24:39 and so that had been a constant challenge for me talking to professor's of Chinese music ethnomusicologist
00:24:50 everywhere and all through the project desperately trying to find this one piece found the piece lived on the Upper
00:25:00 West Side found the piece a professor at Columbia University gave it to me and he's of all the people I talked to
00:25:09 everyone didn't said that's hopeless you can't do that that there can't be one piece of Chinese music but he was
00:25:18 completely no problem I've got it and so he he told me the story of the piece which only made it an even greater
00:25:27 candidate for the record which and I listened to it called Carl Sagan who was in Tucson Arizona addressing the
00:25:37 American Society of newspaper editors and and I left him a message Hotel message center and he called me
00:25:52 back an hour later and heard this beautiful voice say I came back to my hotel room and I find this message that
00:26:01 any card and I asked myself why didn't you leave me this message ten years ago my heart was beating out of my chest I
00:26:14 it was for me a kind of Eureka moment okay a scientific breakthrough yeah a truth a great truth it suddenly been
00:26:25 revealed and of course I was awkward and didn't really know what to say and so I blurted something out like oh I've been
00:26:31 meaning to talk to you about that Karl which wasn't really true I never would have talked to him about it we had been
00:26:37 alone countless times we humans are so awkward in his beautiful moments and I just said for keeps and he thought for a very
00:26:49 brief like a second and said you mean get married and I said yeah and he said yeah and we put down the phone and I
00:27:04 literally was jumping around my apartment like a lunatic because it was so obvious you know it was something
00:27:13 like of course and then the phone rang again and I thought damn no he's gonna say I don't know but he was like I just
00:27:26 want to make sure that that really happened and I said yeah he said we're getting married and I said yeah we're
00:27:34 getting married now this was June 1st 1977 the record had not been affixed to the spacecraft yet and there had been a
00:27:45 lot of controversy about what we were doing I should say that there you know among the hundred and eighteen pictures
00:27:55 was an image of a man and frontally completely naked naked and there was I believe a congressman on the
00:28:08 floor that said NASA to send smut to the stars you know and so NASA really they got very upset they said you can't send
00:28:15 a picture and we had done it so that it was so brilliant it was like this lovely couple completely naked and then the
00:28:24 next image was kind of overlay schematic to show the fetus inside this woman that was developing and then that went off
00:28:34 into you know additional imagery of human reproduction and it really hit me that how much we hate ourselves that we
00:28:45 couldn't bear to be seen as we are so in some sense that congressman also represents our society perhaps his
00:28:55 opposition should have been included as well yes well that's was one of the most vigorous debates during the making of
00:29:03 the record with a you know the five or six people that we collaborated with was do we show do we only put our best foot
00:29:14 forward or do we show Hiroshima outwits the Congo what we have done what do you think represents humanity if you kind of
00:29:24 if you think about it did our darker moments are they essential for Humanity all the wars we've been through all the
00:29:30 tortures and the suffering and the cruelty is that essential for happiness for beauty for creation generally he's
00:29:39 really not essential for a happiness or beauty as for sure I mean it's part of who we are if we're gonna be real about it
00:29:47 which is you know I I think we tell on ourselves even if we don't want to be real we you know I think that if you're
00:29:55 a spacefaring civilization and you've gotten it together sufficiently you can move from world to world then I think
00:30:04 they probably took one look at this derelict spacecraft and they knew that these were people in their techno
00:30:11 logical adolescence yeah and they were just setting forth and they must have had these issues but you know because
00:30:21 and so really you know that's the great thing about lying is that a lie only has a shelf life like if you make a great
00:30:31 work of art that's a forgery people can be fooled immediately but 10 or 15 years 20 years later they start to look at it
00:30:38 yeah you know that begin to realize of the lens our lens of our present is coloring everything that we see so you
00:30:49 know I think it didn't matter that we didn't show our atrocities they would fill in the blanks they would fill in
00:30:57 the blanks so let me sort of ask you've mentioned how likely it is that you and Carla did two souls like yours would
00:31:05 meet in this vast world what are you views on how and why incredibly unlikely things like these
00:31:13 nevertheless do happen it's purely to me a chance it's totally random it's adjust I mean but and the fact is
00:31:23 is there some people or and it's happening every day right now some people are the random casualties of
00:31:32 chance and that and I don't just mean the people who are being you know destroyed in childhood in more time I'm
00:31:41 also or people who starve to death because of famine but also the people who you know who who are not living
00:31:52 to the fullest all of these things I think there's a rent my parents met on the subway in rush hour and so I'm only
00:32:00 here were you because of the most random possible situation and so I've had this a sense of this even before I knew car I
00:32:09 always felt this way that I only existed because of the generosity of the rush hour I know just all of the things all
00:32:20 of the skeins of causality yeah it's interesting because you know that our shower is the source of stress
00:32:27 for a lot of people but clearly in its moments it can also be a source of something beautiful it's right of
00:32:35 strangers meeting and so on so everything everything is has the possibility of doing some fancy right so
00:32:45 let me ask sort of a quick tangent on the Voyager so that this this beautiful romantic notion that Voyager 1 is sort
00:32:55 of our farthest human reach into space if you think of what I don't know if you've seen but what Elon Musk did with
00:33:03 the putting the roadster letting it fly out into space there's a sort of humor to it I think that's also kind of
00:33:11 interesting but maybe you can comment on that but in general if now that we are developing what we were venturing out
00:33:21 into space again in a more serious way what kind of stuff that represent since Voyager was launched should we send out
00:33:30 as a follow-up is there things that you think that's developed the next in in the 40 years after that we should update
00:33:39 the the spacefaring aliens of course now we could send the worldwide we could send everything that's on the world wide
00:33:47 web we could send I mean you know that was a time when we're talking about phonograph records and transistor radios
00:33:57 and you know so we tried to be to take advantage of the existing technology to the fullest extent you know the computer
00:34:05 that was hooked up to me from my brain waves in my heart sounds while I was meditating was the size of a gigantic
00:34:13 room and I'm sure it's not that didn't have the power of a phone as that phone has now so you know we could just I
00:34:21 think we could let it all hang out you just stood send you know ever we I mean that's the wonder like I would send you
00:34:30 know Wikipedia or something and not being a gatekeeper but this thing because we are you were also
00:34:38 it's interesting because it one of the problems of the Internet of having so much information is it's actually the
00:34:46 curation the human curation is still the powerful beautiful thing yeah so what you did with the record is actually is
00:34:54 exactly the right process is kind of boiling down a massive amount of possibilities of what you could send
00:35:01 into something that represents you know the better angels of our nature or represents our humanity so if you think
00:35:10 about you know what would you send from the Internet as opposed to sending all of Wikipedia for example all human
00:35:16 knowledge is there something just new that we've developed you think or fundamentally we're still the same kind
00:35:24 of human species I think fundamentally were the same but we have a kind of way we are we have advanced a to an
00:35:33 astonishing degree in our capacity for data retrieval and for transmission and so you know I would send YouTube I would
00:35:43 send no it really like think of all that you know I I still feel so lucky that there's any great musical artists of the
00:35:56 last hundred years who I revere I can just find them and watch them and listen to them and you know that's fantastic I
00:36:05 also love how democratic it is that we each become curators that we each decide those things now I may not agree with
00:36:16 you know those the choices that everyone makes but of course not because that's not the point the point is is that we
00:36:23 are you know we've discovered largely through the internet that we are an intercommunicating organism and that can
00:36:35 only be good so you could also send now cosmos yes I love it I will be proud I mean you're spoken
00:36:46 about a very specific voice that cosmos I had in that it reveals the magical science I think you said shamanic
00:36:55 journey of it and not the details of the latest breakthrough so on he's just revealing the magic can you
00:37:02 try to describe what this voice of cosmos is with the with the follow-up and the new cosmos that you're working
00:37:12 on now yes well a dream of cosmos is really like Einsteins quote you know it's the idea of the awesome power of
00:37:24 science to be in absolutely everyone's hands you know it belongs to all of us it's not the preserve of a priesthood
00:37:33 it's just just the community of science is becoming more diverse and being less exclusive than it was guilty of in the
00:37:42 not so recent past the discoveries of science our understanding of the cosmos that we live in has really grown by
00:37:54 leaps and bounds and probably we've learned more in the last hundred years about it you know the the tempo of
00:38:03 discovery has picked up so rapidly and so the idea of cosmos from the 1970s when Carl and I and Steven Soter another
00:38:16 astronomer first imagined it was that interweaving not only of these scientific concepts and revelations and
00:38:28 using you know cinematic VFX to take the viewer on this transporting uplifting journey but also the stories of the
00:38:38 searchers because the more I have learned about you know the process of science through my life with Carl and
00:38:51 since the more I am really persuaded that it's that adherence to the facts and to that adherence to that little
00:39:02 proximation that little bit of reality that we've been able to get our hands around is something that we desperately
00:39:10 need and it doesn't matter if you are a scientist in fact the people it matters even more if you're not and since you
00:39:19 know the level of science teaching has been fairly or unfairly maligned and the idea that once there was such a thing as
00:39:30 a television network which of course has now evolved into many other things the idea that you could in the most
00:39:38 democratic way make accessible to absolutely everyone and most especially people who don't even realize that they
00:39:46 have an interest in a subject or who feel so intimidated by the jargon of science and it's kind of exclusive
00:39:56 history the idea that we could do this and you know in season 2 of cosmos spacetime Odyssey we were in a hundred
00:40:05 and eighty-one countries in the space of two weeks it was the largest rollout in television history which is really
00:40:13 amazing for it there is no science-based program by the way just to clarify this series was
00:40:20 rolled out so it was shown in in that many countries you said we were in well our show the show the show which is
00:40:29 incredible I mean the the the hundreds of million whatever that number is that people that watched it it's just it's
00:40:35 crazy it's so crazy Pat for instance  my son had a cerebral hemorrhage here ago and the doctor who saved his life in
00:40:51 a very dangerous situation when he realized that you know that Sam and I were who we were
00:41:00 he said that's why I'm here you know he said if you come of age in a poor country like Colombia and Carl Sagan
00:41:08 calls you to science when you're a child then then you know you go to medicine because the only Avenue open to you but that's
00:41:17 why I'm here and I have heard that story and I hear that story I think every week how does
00:41:27 that make you feel I mean I the the number of scientists I mean a lot of it is quiet right but the number of
00:41:35 scientists cosmos has created is just countless I mean it probably touched a lives I don't know probably it could be
00:41:42 a crazy number of the 90% of scientists or something I'd have been I was going to do that census because I because
00:41:48 that's the month the greatest gratification because that's the dream of science and that's the whole idea is
00:41:56 that if it belongs to all of us and not just a tiny few then we have some chance of determining how it's used and if it's
00:42:07 only in the hands of people whose only whose only interests are the balance sheet or hegemony over other nations or
00:42:19 things like that then it'll probably end up being a gun aimed in our heads but if it's distributed in the widest possible
00:42:29 way a capability that we now have because of our technology then this chance is that that it'll be used with
00:42:39 wisdom that's that's the dream of it so that's that's why we did the first cosmos we wanted to take not just as I
00:42:48 say the scientific information but also tell the stories of these searchers because for us and for me it carrying on
00:42:58 this a series in the second and third seasons the the primary interest was that we wouldn't tell a story unless it
00:43:09 was a kind of a three-fer you know it was not just a way to understand a new sign a scientific idea but it was also a
00:43:19 way to understand what if it matters what's true wow the world can change for us and how we can be protected
00:43:29 and if it doesn't matter what's true then we're in grave danger because we have the capability to not only destroy
00:43:39 ourselves and our civilization but to take so many species with us and I'd like to talk to you about that
00:43:46 particular the sort of the dangers of ourselves in a little bit but sort of to linger on cosmos maybe for the first the
00:43:57 1980 in the 2014 follow-up what a what's a or one of the or several memorable moments from the creation of either of
00:44:09 those seasons well you know the critical thing really was the fact that Seth MacFarlane became our champion because I
00:44:19 had been with three colleagues I had been slapping around from network to network with a treatment for cosmos and
00:44:28 every network said they wanted to do it but they wouldn't give me creative control and they wouldn't give me enough
00:44:37 money to make it cinematic and to make it feel like you're really going on an adventure and so I think both of those things
00:44:44 sorry in turn draw both these things are given what cosmos represents the the legacy of it and the legacy of Carl
00:44:52 Sagan is essential control especially in the modern world I it's it's was wonderful the Assad control he did not
00:45:01 really push it no I'm sure I know they would look at me like I was nuts you know and they probably must have
00:45:07 entertained the idea that maybe I didn't really want to do it you know because that was afraid or something but I kept
00:45:13 saying no and it wasn't until I met Seth MacFarlane and he took me to Fox and you Peter rice and said you know I'll pay
00:45:25 for half the pilot if I have to you know and Peter rice was like put your money away and Seth said that yeah and and and
00:45:33 and in every time since in the in the 10-year sense at every turn when we needed Seth to intervene on our behalf
00:45:44 he stood up and he did it and so that was like in a way that is the you know the watershed for me of the everything
00:45:53 that followed since and then I was so lucky because I know Steve and I Steve Souter and I written the original cosmos
00:46:00 with Carl and were co-opted and collaborated on the treatment for a season 2 and then Brannon Braga came
00:46:11 into our project at the perfect moment and has proven to be like just the really I have been so lucky my whole
00:46:19 life I've collaborated I've been lucky with the people my collaborators have been extraordinary and so that was a
00:46:27 critical thing but also to have you know for instance astonishing VFX supervisor who comes from the movies who heads the
00:46:38 global Association of VFX people Jeff oaken and and then and you know I can rattle off ten more names I'd be happy
00:46:49 to do that and it was that collaboration so the people were essential to the creation of absolutely I mean when it
00:46:56 came down I have to say that when it came down to the vision of what the series would be that with me sitting in
00:47:03 my home looking out the window and I'm you know really imagining like what I wanted to do can you pause on that for a
00:47:09 second like what's that process because it you know cosmos is also it's grounded in science of course but it's also
00:47:15 incredibly imaginative and the words used are carefully crafted thank you so what if you couldn't talk about the
00:47:26 process of that the big picture imaginative thinking and so the rigorous crafting of words that like basically
00:47:35 turns into something like poetry thank you so much for me these are rare occasions for human self-esteem the
00:47:49 scientists that we bring to life in cosmos are people in my view who have everything we need to see us
00:48:00 through this current crisis it's there very often they come they're poor they're a female they're outsiders who
00:48:13 are not expected to have gifts that are so pretentious but they persevere and so you have someone like Michael Faraday
00:48:25 who is comes from a family dysfunctional family of like 14 people and you know if never goes to university never learns
00:48:36 the math but you know is the you know there's Einstein years later looking up at that picture of Faraday to inspire
00:48:47 him there so it's you know if we had people we've had kind of humility and unselfishness who didn't want to patent
00:48:58 everything me as you know Michael Faraday created the wealth of the 20th century with his various inventions and
00:49:07 yet he never took out a single patent at a time when people were patenting everything because that was not what he
00:49:14 was about and to me that's a kind of almost a saintliness vet says that you know that here's a man who finds in his
00:49:26 life this tremendous gratification from searching and it's just so impressive to me and there are so many other people in
00:49:34 cosmos especially the new season of cosmos which is called possible worlds possible beautiful title with possible
00:49:42 worlds well I stole it from an author and a scientist with the 1940s but it it for me encapsulate not just you know the
00:49:52 exoplanets that we'd begun to discover not just you know the the worlds that we might visit but also the world that this
00:50:03 could be a hopeful vision of the future you asked me what is common to all three seasons of
00:50:08 what is that voice it's the voice of hope it's a voice that says there is the future which we bring to life and I
00:50:19 think fairly dazzling fashion that we can still have you know and in sitting down to imagine what this season would
00:50:27 be the new season I'd be sitting where I live in Ithaca beautiful trees everywhere waterfalls yeah you're
00:50:37 sitting there thinking well you can't how do you how do you awaken people I mean you can't yell at them and say
00:50:45 we're all gonna die no it's not it doesn't help it doesn't help but I think if you give them a vision of the future
00:50:58 that's not pie in the sky but something the ways in which science can be redemptive can actually remediate our
00:51:09 future we have those capabilities right now as well as the capabilities to do things in the cosmos that we could be
00:51:18 doing right now but we're not doing them not because we don't know how to how you know with the engineering or the
00:51:26 material sciences or the physics we know all we need to know but we're a little bit paralyzed in some sense and you know
00:51:35 we're like I always think we're like the toddler you know like we we left our mothers legs you know and scurried out
00:51:44 to the moon yeah and we had a moment of wow we can do this and then we realized and somehow we had a failure of nerve
00:51:52 and we went scurrying back to our mother and you know did things that really weren't gonna get us out there like a
00:51:59 Space Shuttle things like that because it was a kind of failure of nerve so cosmos is about overcoming those fears
00:52:09 we're now as a civilization ready to be a teenager venturing out into college we're returning back exactly you're
00:52:16 exactly and that and that's one of my theories about our current situation is that this is our
00:52:26 adolescence and I was a total mess I wasn't I was reckless irresponsible totally I didn't I was inconsiderate
00:52:36 yeah I the reality of other people's feelings and the future didn't exist for me so why should a technologically
00:52:45 adolescent civilization be any different but you know the vast majority of people I know made it through that period and
00:53:00 went on to be more wise and that's what my hope is for our civilization on a sort of darker and more difficult
00:53:09 subject in terms of so you talked about the cosmos being an inspiration for science and for us growing out of our
00:53:19 messy adolescence but nevertheless there is threats in this world so do you worry about existential threats like emission
00:53:29 nuclear weapons you worry about nuclear war yes and if you could also maybe comment I don't know how much you've
00:53:36 thought about it but I was there's folks like Elon Musk or worried about the existential threats of artificial
00:53:43 intelligence sort of our robotic computer creations sort of yeah resulting in us humans losing control so
00:53:51 can you speak to the things that were you in terms of existential concern you know like not to think and not to look
00:54:04 at for instance are rapidly burgeoning capability in artificial intelligence not and to see how sick so much of the
00:54:17 planet is not to be concerned and sick isn't evil potentially well hum-hum is cruelty and brutality is happening at
00:54:27 this very moment and I would put climate change higher up on that list because I believe that there are on
00:54:37 Sene discoveries that we are making right now for instance all that methane that's coming out of the ocean floor
00:54:46 that was sequestered because of the permafrost which is now melting you know I think there are other effects besides
00:54:56 our greed and short-term thinking you know that we are triggering now with all the greenhouse gases were putting into
00:55:03 the atmosphere and that worries me day at night I think about it every single every moment really because I really
00:55:11 think that's how we have to be we have to begin to really focus on how grave the challenges to our civilization and
00:55:26 to the other species that are it's the mass it this is a mass extinction event that we're living through and we're
00:55:34 seeing it we're seeing news of it every day so what do you think about another touchy subject but what do you think
00:55:41 about the politicization of science on topics like global warming embryonic stem cell research and other topics like
00:55:49 it what's your sense why what do you mean by the politicization of meaning that if you say I think what you just
00:56:00 said which is global warming as a serious concerns human caused arrange some detrimental effects currently
00:56:07 there's a large percent of the population of the United States that would as opposed to listening to that
00:56:16 statement would immediately think oh that's just a liberal talking point that's not I mean it's not so true anymore
00:56:25 I don't think our problem is a population events skeptical about climate change because I think that the
00:56:35 extreme weather fire events that we are experiencing with such frequency it's really gotten to people I think there I
00:56:44 think that there are people in leadership position who choose to ignore it and to pretend
00:56:53 it's not there but ultimately I think they will be rejected the question is will it be fast enough but you know this
00:57:03 I don't I think actually that most people have really finally taken the reality of global climate change to
00:57:12 heart and they look at their children and grandchildren and they don't feel good because they
00:57:21 come from a world which was in many ways in terms of climate fairly familiar and benign and they know that we're headed
00:57:29 in another direction and it's not just that it's what we do to the oceans the rivers the air you know I mean you asked
00:57:38 me like what is what is the message of cosmos is it's that is that we have to think in longer terms you know I think
00:57:49 of the Soviet Union United States in the Cold War and they're ready to kill each other over these two different views of
00:57:57 the distribution of resources but neither of them has a form of human social organization that thinks in terms
00:58:06 of a hundred years let alone a thousand years which are the timescales that science speaks in and that's part of the
00:58:16 problem is that we have to get a grip on reality and where we're headed and it's I I'm not fatalistic at all but I do
00:58:29 feel like it you and in setting out to to do this series each season we were talking about climate change in the
00:58:39 original cosmos in Episode four and warning about inadvertent climate modification in 1980
00:58:48 you know and of course Carl did his PhD thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus and he was painfully cognizant of it
00:58:56 when a runaway greenhouse effect would do to our planet and not only that but the climb
00:59:01 history of the planet which we go into in great detail in the series so yeah I mean how are we gonna get a grip on this
00:59:10 if not through some kind of understanding of science can I just say one more thing about science is that its
00:59:22 powers of prophecy are astonishing you launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know where each and every planet in the solar
00:59:34 system is going to be in every moon and you rendezvous with that flawlessly and you exceed the design specifications of
00:59:44 the greatest dreams that the engineers and then you go on to explore the Milky Way galaxy and you do it I mean you know
00:59:53 the climate scientists some of the people that we use stories we tell in cosmos they their predictions were and
01:00:04 they were working with very early computer modeling capabilities they have proven to be so robust nuclear winter
01:00:13 all of these things this is a prophetic power and yet how crazy that you know it's like it's like the Romans with
01:00:22 their lead cooking pots and their lead pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their own people's hearts this is us we know
01:00:32 better and yet we are acting as if it's business as usual yeah the beautiful complexity of human nature there's a
01:00:44 speaking of which let me ask a tough question I guess because there's so many possible answers but what aspect of life
01:00:50 here on earth do you find most fascinating from the origin of life the evolutionary process itself the origin
01:00:59 of the human mind so intelligence the some of the technological developments going on now or us venturing out into
01:01:06 space or space exploration what just inspires you inspire me but I just say that to me
01:01:15 at the archana as I've gotten older to me the origin of life has become less interesting interesting well because I
01:01:25 feel well not because it's more I think I understand I have a better grasp of how it might have happened do you think
01:01:34 it was a huge leap so I may think it was that we are a byproduct of geophysics and I think it's not I my suspicion of
01:01:44 course which is taking it with a grain of salt but my suspicion is that it happens more often and more places than
01:01:54 we like to think because you know after all the history of our thinking about ourselves there's been a constant series
01:02:01 of demotions in which we've had you realize no no so to me that's not at the center of the origin of consciousness is
01:02:11 to me also not so amazing if you think of it as you know going back to these one celled organisms of a billion years
01:02:21 ago who had had to know well if I go higher up I'll get too much Sun and if I go lower
01:02:28 down not I'll be protected from you know UV rays things like that they have to know that or you I eat me I don't I mean
01:02:37 even that I can see if you know that then knowing what we know now it's just it's not so hard to fathom it seems like
01:02:47 you know there's I never believed there was a duality between our minds and our bodies and I think that even
01:02:55 consciousness all those seem to me except my Oh physics chemistry yes geochemistry geophysics absolutely of
01:03:08 you know it makes perfect sense to me and it doesn't make it any less wondrous it it doesn't wrap it at all of the
01:03:20 wonder of it and so yeah I think that's amazing I think you know we tell the story of someone you have never heard of
01:03:27 I guarantee and I think you're very knowledgeable of a subject who was more responsible for our ability to venture
01:03:37 out to other worlds when anyone else and who was completely forgotten and so those are the kinds of stories I like
01:03:50 best for cosmos you tell me who buy my book you know but I'm just saying like this person would be forgotten but you
01:04:00 know I you just the way that we do cosmos is that like I ask a question to myself we really want to get to the
01:04:08 bottom to the answer and keep going deeper deeper until we find what the story is a story that I know because I'm
01:04:17 not a scientist if it moves me if it if it moves me then I want to tell it and other people be moved
01:04:25 do you ponder mortality yes human mortality and maybe even your own mortality oh all the time
01:04:33 I just turned 70 so yeah I think about it a lot I mean it's you know how could you not think about it but  what do
01:04:42 you make of this short life of ours a I mean let me ask  sort of another way you've lost Carl and speaking of
01:04:56 mortality if you could be if you could choose immortality you know it's possible that science allows us to live
01:05:03 much much longer is that something you would choose for yourself for Carl Carl definitely I would you know in a
01:05:12 nanosecond I would take that deal but not for me I mean if car were alive yes I would want to live forever but no
01:05:22 would it be fun forever that's I don't know it's just that the universe is so full of so many wonderful things just
01:05:30 discover that it feels like it wouldn't be fine but no I don't want to live forever I I have had a magical life I
01:05:39 just might you know Mike craziest dreams have come true and I feel you know I forgive me but this
01:05:48 crazy quirk of fate it put my most joyful deepest feelings feelings that decades later of 42 years
01:06:00 later I know how real how true those feelings were everything that happened after that was an affirmation of how
01:06:11 true those feelings were and so I don't feel that way I feel like I have gotten so much more than my share not just
01:06:21 my extraordinary life with Carl my family my parents my children my friends the places that I've been able to
01:06:35 explore the but the books I've read the music ever heard so I feel like you know if it'd be much better if instead of
01:06:45 working on the immortality of the lucky few of the most privileged people in the society I would really like to see a
01:06:53 concerted effort for us to get us our act together you know that to me is topic a more pressing
01:07:03 you know this possible world is the challenge and we're at a kind of moment where if we can we can make that choice
01:07:13 so immortality doesn't really interest me I I really I love nature and I have to say that I I because I'm a product of
01:07:25 nature I recognize that it's it's great gifts and it's great cruelty well I don't think there's a better way to end
01:07:33 it anything thank you so much for talking to us at all it's wonderful really appreciate it I really enjoyed it

01:08:14 from Carl Sagan what an astonishing thing a book is it's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which
01:08:23 are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles but one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person
01:08:30 maybe somebody dead for thousands of years across the millennia and authors speaking clearly and silently inside
01:08:40 your head directly to you writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions binding together people who never knew
01:08:49 each other citizens of distant epochs books break the shackles of time a book is proof that humans are capable of
