00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Sean Carroll part 2 the second time we've spoken on the podcast you can get
00:00:08 the link to the first time in the description this time we focus on quantum mechanics and the many-worlds
00:00:15 interpretation that he details elegantly in his new book titled something deeply hidden I own and enjoy both the ebook
00:00:24 and audiobook versions of it listening to Sean read about entanglement complementarity and the emergence of
00:00:31 space-time reminds me of bob ross teaching the world how to paint and his own television show
00:00:38 if you don't know who Bob Ross is you're truly missing out look him up he'll make you fall in love with painting Sean
00:00:46 Carroll is the Bob Ross of theoretical physics he's the author of several popular books a host of a great podcast
00:00:54 called mindscape and is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and the Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum

00:01:16 with me on Twitter Alex Friedman spelled Fri D ma N and now here's my conversation with Sean Carroll
00:01:25 Isaac Newton developed what we now call classical mechanics that you describe very nicely in your new book because you
00:01:31 do with a lot of basic concepts in physics so was classical mechanics I can throw a rock and can predict the
00:01:41 trajectory of that rocks flight but if we could put ourselves back into Newton's time his theories work to
00:01:49 predict things but as I understand he himself thought that they were their interpretations of those predictions
00:01:56 were absurd perhaps he just said it for religious reasons and so on but in particular sort of a world of
00:02:04 interaction without contact so action at a distance it didn't make sense to them in a sort
00:02:10 of a human interpretation level does it make sense to you that things can affect other things at a distance it does but
00:02:19 you know that so that was one of Newton's worries you're actually right in a slightly different way about the
00:02:25 religious worries he he was smart enough this is off the topic with still fascinating Newton almost invented chaos
00:02:32 theory as soon as he invented classical mechanics he realized that in the solar system so he was able to explain how
00:02:38 planets move around the Sun but typically you would describe the orbit of the earth
00:02:43 ignoring the effects of Jupiter and Saturn and so forth just doing the earth and the Sun he he kind of knew even
00:02:49 though he couldn't do the math that if you included the effects of Jupiter and Saturn the other planets the solar
00:02:54 system would be unstable like the orbits of the planets would get out of whack so he thought that God would intervene
00:03:00 occasionally to sort of move the planets back into orbit which is how you could only way you could explain how they were
00:03:05 there presumably forever but the worries about classical mechanics were a little bit different they worried about gravity
00:03:10 in particularly wasn't it worried about classical mechanics worried about gravity how in the world does the earth
00:03:15 know that there's something called the Sun 93 million miles away that is exerting gravitational force on
00:03:21 it and he said he literally said you know I leave that for future generations to think about because I don't know what
00:03:27 the answer is and in fact the people under emphasize this but future generations figured it out Pierre Simone
00:03:35 Laplace in circa 1800 showed that you could rewrite Newtonian gravity as a field theory so instead of
00:03:41 just talking about the force due to gravity you can talk about the gravitational field or the gravitational
00:03:47 potential field and then there's no action at a distance it's exactly the same theory empirically it makes exactly
00:03:52 the same predictions but what's happening is instead of the Sun just reaching out across the void there is a
00:03:58 gravitational field in between the Sun and the earth that obeys an equation Laplace's equation cleverly enough and
00:04:05 that tells us exactly what the field does so even in Newtonian gravity you don't need action at a distance now what
00:04:12 many people say is that Einstein solved this problem because he invented general relativity and general relativity
00:04:17 there's certainly a field in between the Earth and the Sun but also there's the speed of light as a limit in Laplace's
00:04:24 theory which was exactly Newton's theory just in a different mathematical language there could still be
00:04:29 instantaneous action across the universe whereas in general relativity if you shake something here its gravitational
00:04:35 impulse radiates out at the speed of light and we call that a gravitational wave and we can detect those so but I I
00:04:43 really it rubs me the wrong way to think that we should presume the answer should look one way or the other like if it
00:04:50 turned out that there was action at a distance in physics and that was the best way to describe things that I would
00:04:55 do it that way it's actually a very deep question because when we don't know what the right laws of physics are when we're
00:05:01 guessing at them when we're hypothesizing at what they might be we are often guided by our intuitions
00:05:07 about what they should be I mean Einstein famously was very guided by his intuitions and he did not like the idea
00:05:16 of action at a distance we don't know whether he was right or not it depends on your interpretation of quantum
00:05:21 mechanics and it depends on even how you talk about quantum mechanics within any one interpretation if you see every
00:05:27 forces of field or any other interpretation of action at a distance he's just stepping back to sort of
00:05:39 caveman thinking like do you really can you really sort of understand what it means for a force to be a field as
00:05:46 everywhere so if you look at gravity like what do you think about I think so it's just something that you've been can
00:05:57 and by society to think that to map the fact that science is extremely well predictive of something to believing
00:06:06 that you actually understand it like you can intuitively under the how as the degree that human beings can understand
00:06:12 anything that you actually understand it are you just trusting the beauty and the power of the predictive power science
00:06:22 that depends on what you mean by this idea of truly understandings right right you know I mean can I Lily understand
00:06:29 four months Last Theorem you know it's easy to state it but do I really appreciate what it means for incredibly
00:06:38 large numbers right yeah I think yes I think I do understand it but like if you want to just push people on well you put
00:06:43 your intuition doesn't go to the places where Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat's Last Theorem and I can say fine
00:06:50 by something I understand the theorem and likewise I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding of
00:06:57 fields pervading space time whether it's the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field or whatever the
00:07:04 Higgs field of course one's intuition gets worse and worse as you get trickier in the quantum field theory and all
00:07:11 sorts of new phenomena that come up in quantum field theory so our intuitions aren't perfect but I think it's also
00:07:17 okay to say that our intuitions get trained right like you know I have different intuitions now that I had when
00:07:22 I was a baby that's okay that's not an intuition is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are we can we can train it a
00:07:28 little bit so that's where I'm gonna bring in norm Chomsky for a second who thinks that our cognitive abilities are
00:07:37 sort of evolved through time and so they're they're biologically constrained and so there's a clear limit as he puts
00:07:45 it to our cognitive abilities and it's a very harsh limit but you actually kind of said something interesting and nature
00:07:52 versus nurture thing here is we can train our intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able to
00:07:59 understand some of these tricky casas so do you think there's limits to our understanding that's deeply rooted
00:08:07 hard-coded into our biology that we can't overcome there could be limits to things like our
00:08:15 ability to visualize okay but when someone like Ed Witten proves a theorem about you know hundred dimensional
00:08:22 mathematical spaces he's not visualizing it he's doing the math that doesn't stop him from understanding the result I
00:08:29 think and I would love to understand this better but my rough feeling which is not very educated is that you know
00:08:36 there's some threshold that one crosses in abstraction when one becomes kind of like a Turing machine right one has the
00:08:45 ability to contain in one's brain logical formal symbolic structures and manipulate them and that's a leap that
00:08:52 we can make as human beings that that dogs and cats haven't made and once you get there I'm not sure there are any
00:09:00 limits to our ability to understand the scientific world at all maybe there are there's certainly a ability limits on
00:09:06 our ability to calculate things right you know people are not very good at taking cube roots of million digit
00:09:12 numbers in their head but that's not an element of understanding it's certainly not a little bit in principle so of
00:09:17 course there's a human you would say that doesn't feel to be limits to our understanding but sort of hey have you
00:09:27 thought that the universe is actually a lot simpler than it appears to us and we just will never be able to like it's
00:09:37 outside of our okay so us our cognitive abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever kind of
00:09:45 experimental simulation devices we can put together is there limits to that is is it possible there's limits to that
00:09:56 well of course it's possible there is or is there any good reason to think that we're anywhere close to the limits is a
00:10:04 harder question look imagine asking this question 500 years ago to the world's greatest thinkers right like are we
00:10:09 approaching the limits of our ability to understand the natural world and by definition there are questions about the
00:10:16 natural world that are most interesting to us that are the ones we but yet understand right so there's
00:10:21 always we're always faced with these puzzles we don't yet know and I don't know what they would have said five
00:10:25 hundred years ago but they didn't even know about classical mechanics much less quantum mechanics so we know that they
00:10:32 were nowhere close to how well they could do right they could do normally better than they were doing at the time
00:10:38 I see no reason why the same thing isn't true for us today so of all the worries that keep me awake at night the human
00:10:45 minds inability to rationally comprehend the world is low on the list well put so one interesting philosophical point and
00:10:54 quantum mechanics bring up is the that you talk about the distinction between the world as it is and the world as we
00:11:03 observe it so staying at the human level for a second how big is the gap between what our perception system allows us to
00:11:12 see and the world as it is outside our minds I sort of so if not at the quantum mechanical level yeah as just are these
00:11:22 particular tools we have which is a few senses and cognitive abilities to process those senses well that last
00:11:29 phrase having the cognitive abilities to process them carries a lot right I mean there is our sort of intuitive
00:11:36 understanding of the world you don't need to teach people about gravity for them to know that apples fall from trees
00:11:42 right that's something that we figure out pretty quickly object permanence things like that the three
00:11:47 dimensionality of space even if we don't have the mathematical language to say that we kind of know that it's true on
00:11:54 the other hand no one opens their eyes and sees atoms all right or molecules for ourselves for that matter forget
00:12:01 about quantum mechanics so but we got there we got to understanding that there are atoms and cells using the
00:12:09 combination of our senses and our cognitive capacities so adding the ability of our cognitive capacities to
00:12:16 our senses is adding an enormous amount and I don't think there's a hard and fast boundary you know if you believe in
00:12:22 cells if you believe that we understand those then there's no reason you believe we can't believe in quantum mechanics
00:12:30 just as well what to you is the most conservation of momentum can you elaborate yeah if you were Aristotle
00:12:43 when Aristotle wrote his book on physics he made the following very obvious point we're on video here right so people can
00:12:49 see this so if I push the bottle let me cover this bottle so we do not have a mess but okay so I push the bottle it
00:12:54 moves and if I stop pushing itself moving yes and this is this kind of thing is repeated a large number of
00:13:01 times all over the place if you don't keep pushing things they stop moving this is a indisputably true fact about
00:13:09 our everyday environment okay and for Aristotle this blew up into a whole picture of the world in which things had
00:13:17 natures and teleology x' and they had places they wanted to be and when you were pushing them you were moving them
00:13:21 away from where they wanted to be and they would return and stuff like that and it took a thousand years or fifteen
00:13:29 hundred years for people to say actually if it weren't for things like dissipation and air resistance and
00:13:37 friction and so forth the natural thing is for things to move forever in a straight line there's a constant
00:13:43 velocity right conservation of momentum and that is the reason why I think that's the most beautiful idea in
00:13:51 physics is because it shifts us from a view of nature's and teleology to a view of patterns in the world so when you
00:14:01 were Aristotle you needed to talk a vocabulary of why is this happening what's the purpose of it what's the
00:14:08 cause etc because you know it's nature does or does not want to do that whereas once you believe in conservation of
00:14:13 momentum things just happen they they just follow the pattern you give me you have Laplace's deamon ultimately right
00:14:19 you give me the state of the world today I can predict what's gonna do in the future I can predict where it was in the
00:14:24 past it's impersonal and it's also instantaneous it's not directed toward any future goals it's
00:14:30 just doing what it does given the current state of the universe that I think even more than either classical
00:14:35 mechanics or quantum mechanics and that is the profound deep insight that gets modern science off the ground
00:14:43 you don't need nature's and purposes and goals you just need some patterns so it's the first moment in our
00:14:50 understanding of the way the universe works where you branch from the intuitive physical space to kind of the
00:14:58 space of ideas and also the other point you said which is conveniently most of the interesting ideas are acting in the
00:15:06 moment you don't need to know the history of time or the future then of course this took a long time to get
00:15:12 there right I mean the conservation momentum itself took hundreds of years it's weird just like someone would say
00:15:18 something interesting and then the next interesting thing would be said like 150 or 200 years later right they weren't
00:15:23 even talking to each other there was reading each other's books and probably the first person to directly say that in
00:15:31 outer space in the vacuum projectile would move at a constant velocity was Avicenna even Sina and the Persian
00:15:38 Golden Age circa 1000 and he didn't like the idea he used that just like furniture used Schrodinger's cat to
00:15:43 studies freely you don't believe that right even Sina was saying surely you don't believe there really is a vacuum
00:15:49 because if there was a really vacuum things could keep moving forever right but still he got right the idea that
00:15:55 there was this conservation of something impetus or mile he would call it and that's 500 years 600 600 years before
00:16:03 classical mechanics and Isaac Newton so you know Galileo played a big role in this but he didn't exactly get it right
00:16:09 and so it just takes a long time for this to sink in because it is so against our everyday experience do you think it
00:16:16 was a big leap a brave or a difficult leap of sort of math and science to be able to say that momentum was conserved
00:16:29 I do you know I think it's a example of human reason in action you know even Aristotle knew that his theory had
00:16:35 issues because you could fire an arrow and it would go a long way before it stopped so if his theory was things just
00:16:42 automatically stopped what's going on and he had this elaborate story I don't know if you've heard the story but the
00:16:48 arrow would push the air in front of it away and the molecules of air would run around to the back of the arrow and push
00:16:54 it again and anyone reading this is going like really that's that's what you thought but it was that kind of thought
00:16:59 experiment that we got people to say like actually know if it weren't for the air molecules at
00:17:04 all there I would just go on by itself and it's always this give-and-take between thought and experience back and
00:17:10 forth right theory and experiment we would say today another big question that I think comes up certainly with
00:17:20 quantum mechanics is what's the difference between math and physics to you to me you know very very roughly
00:17:29 math is about the logical structure of all possible worlds and physics is about our actual world and it just feels like
00:17:38 our actual world is a gray area when you start talking about interpretations of quantum mechanics or no I'm certainly
00:17:45 using the word world in the broadest sense all of reality so I think the reality is specific I don't think that
00:17:53 there's every possible thing going on in reality I think there are rules whether it's the Schrodinger equation or
00:18:00 whatever so i think i think that there's a sensible notion of the set of all possible worlds and we live in one of
00:18:05 them the world that we're talking about might be a multiverse might be many worlds of quantum mechanics might be
00:18:09 much bigger than the world of our everyday experience but it's still one physically contiguous world in some
00:18:18 sense but so if you look at the overlap of math and physics it feels like when physics tries to reach for understanding
00:18:28 of our world it uses the tools of math to sort of reach beyond the limit of our current understanding what do you make
00:18:38 of that process of sort of using math to so you start maybe with intuition or you might start with the math and then build
00:18:45 up an intuition or but this kind of reaching into the darkness into the mystery of the world would math well I
00:18:51 think I would put it a little bit differently I think we have theories theories of the physical world which we
00:18:59 then extrapolate and ask you know what do we conclude if we take these seriously well beyond where we've
00:19:04 actually tested them it is separately true that math is really really useful when we construct physical theories and
00:19:11 you know famously Eugene Wigner asked about the unreasonable success of method Mattox and physics I think that's a
00:19:17 little bit wrong because anything that could happen any other theory of physics that wasn't the real world with some
00:19:24 other world you could always describe it mathematically it's just it might be a mess the surprising thing is not that
00:19:31 math works but that the math is so simple and easy that you can write it down on a t-shirt right I mean that's
00:19:39 what is amazing that's an enormous compression of information that seems to be valid in the real world so that's an
00:19:46 interesting fact about our world which maybe we could hope to explain or just take as a brute fact I don't know but
00:19:53 once you have that you know it there's this the indelible relationship between math and physics but but philosophically
00:19:59 I do want to separate them well we what we extrapolate we don't extrapolate math because there's a whole bunch of wrong
00:20:04 math you know that doesn't apply to our world right we extrapolate the physical theory that we best think explains our
00:20:12 world again an unanswerable question why do you think our world is so easily compressible into beautiful equations
00:20:21 yeah I mean like I just hinted at I don't know if there's an answer to that question there could be what would an
00:20:27 answer look like well an answer could look like if you showed that there was something about our world that maximized
00:20:36 something you know the the mean of the simplicity and the powerfulness of the laws of physics or you know with maybe
00:20:42 we're just generic maybe in the set of all possible worlds this is what the world would look like right like I were
00:20:47 I don't really know I tend to think not I tend to think that there is something specific and rock-bottom about the facts
00:20:55 of our world that don't have further explanation like the fact of the world exists at all and furthermore the
00:21:00 specific laws of physics that we have I think in some sense we're just gonna at some level we're gonna say and that's
00:21:06 how it is and you know we can't explain anything more we I don't know how if we're anywhere close to that right now
00:21:12 but that seems plausible to me and speaking of rock bottom one of the things so your book kind of reminded me
00:21:19 a reveal to me is that what's fundamental and what's emergent it just feels like I don't even know anymore
00:21:26 what's fundamental in in physics if there's anything it feels like everything especially with quantum
00:21:33 mechanics is revealing to us is that most interesting things that I would as a he as a limited human would think are
00:21:41 fundamental or it can actually be explained as emergent from the the more deeper laws I mean we don't know of
00:21:51 course is you had to get that on the table like we don't know what is fundamental we do know we do have reason
00:21:57 to say that certain things are more fundamental than others right atoms and molecules are more fundamental than
00:22:04 cells and organs quantum fields are more fundamental than atoms and molecules we don't know if that ever bottoms out I I
00:22:12 do think that there's sensible ways to think about this the if you if you describe something like this table as a
00:22:18 table it has a height and a width and it's made of a certain material and has a certain solidity and weight and so
00:22:23 forth that's the very useful description as far as it goes there's a whole nother description at this table in terms of a
00:22:29 whole collection of atoms strung together in certain ways the language of the atoms is more comprehensive than the
00:22:36 language of the table you could break apart to the table smash it to pieces still talk about it as atoms but you
00:22:42 could no longer talk about it as a table right so I think of this comprehensiveness the domain of validity
00:22:49 of a theory gets broader and broader as the theory gets more and more fundamental so what do you think Newton
00:22:59 would say maybe write in a book review if you read your latest book on quantum mechanics something deeply hidden would
00:23:06 take a long time for him to think that any of this was making any sense you catch him up pretty quick in the
00:23:12 beginning yeah give him a shout out that's right I mean he used the man I'm happy to say that Newton was the
00:23:18 greatest scientists who ever lived I mean he met in calculus in his spare time which would have made it the
00:23:23 greatest mathematician just all by himself right I'll buy that one thing but of course you know it's funny
00:23:30 because Newton was in some sense still a pre-modern thinker rocky Kolb who is a cosmologists at at the University of
00:23:39 Chicago said that you know Galileo even though he can be for Newton was a more modern thinker
00:23:44 than than Newton was like if he got Galileo and brought him to the present day you take him six months to catch up and
00:23:48 then he be in your office telling you while your most recent paper was wrong whereas Newton just thought in this kind
00:23:55 of more mystical way you know he wrote a lot more about the Bible and alchemy didn't he ever did about physics and but
00:24:02 he was also more brilliant than anybody else and and way more mathematically astute than Galileo so I really don't
00:24:09 know you know he might have he might just yeah say like give me the textbooks leave me alone for a few months and then
00:24:16 be caught up but he but he or he might have had mental blocks against against seeing the world in this way I really
00:24:21 don't know or perhaps find an interesting mystical interpretation of quantum mechanics very possible yeah is
00:24:27 there any other scientists or philosophers through history that you would like to know their opinion of your
00:24:36 book that's against a good question I mean Einstein is the obvious one right y'all and he was not that long ago but
00:24:42 speculate at the end of my book about what his opinion would be I am curious as to you know what about older
00:24:49 philosophers like Hume or Conte right like what would they have thought or Aristotle you know what would they
00:24:55 thought about modern physics because they do in philosophy your predilections end up paint playing a much bigger role
00:25:03 in your ultimate conclusions cuz you're not as tied down by what the data is in physics you know physics is lucky
00:25:10 because we can't stray too far off the reservation as long as we're trying to explain the world that we actually see
00:25:15 in our telescopes and microscopes but it's it's just not fair to play that game because the people were thinking
00:25:21 about didn't know a whole bunch of things that we know right like we lived through a lot that they didn't live
00:25:28 through so by the time we got them caught up they'd be different people so let me ask a bunch of basic questions I
00:25:38 think it would be interesting useful for people are not familiar but even for people who are extremely well familiar
00:25:44 let's start with what is quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is the paradigm of physics that came into being
00:25:52 in the early part of the 20th century that replaced classical mechanics and it replaced
00:25:58 classical mechanics in a weird way that we're still coming to terms with so in classical mechanics you have an object
00:26:05 it as a location has a velocity and if you know the location and velocity of everything in the world you can say what
00:26:10 everything's gonna do quantum mechanics has an aspect of it that is kind of on the same lines there's something called
00:26:18 a quantum state or the wave function and there's an equation governing what the quantum state does so it's very much
00:26:24 like classical mechanics the wave function is different it's sort of a wave it's a vector in a huge dimensional
00:26:30 vector space rather than a position in a velocity but okay that's a detail and the equation is the Schrodinger equation
00:26:36 not Newton's laws but okay again a detail where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different is that
00:26:42 there's a whole nother set of rules in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics in addition to saying that
00:26:48 there's a quantum state and it evolves in time and all these new rules have to do with what happens when you look at
00:26:53 the system when you observe it when you measure it in classical mechanics there were no rules about observing you just
00:26:59 look at it and you see what's going on that that was that right in quantum mechanics the way we teach it there's
00:27:06 something profoundly fundamental about the act of measurement or observation and the system dramatically changes its
00:27:13 state even though it has a wave function like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle as sort of spread
00:27:20 out in a cloud when you look at it you don't see that cloud when you look at it it looks like a particle with a location
00:27:26 so it dramatically changes its state right away and the effects of that change can be instantly seen and what
00:27:33 the electron does next so that's the again we need to be careful because we don't agree on what quantum mechanics
00:27:39 says that's what I need to say like in the textbook view etc right but in the textbook view quantum mechanics unlike
00:27:47 any other theory of physics places  gives a fundamental role to the act of measurement so maybe even more basic
00:27:56 what is an atom and what is an electron sure this all came together you know in a few years around the turn of the last
00:28:03 century right around the year 1900 Adams predated then of course the word Adam goes back to the ancient Greeks but
00:28:11 it was the chemists in the 1800's that really first got experimental evidence for atoms they realized you know that
00:28:19 there were two different types of tin oxide and in these two different types of tin oxide there was exactly twice as
00:28:26 much oxygen in one type as the other and like why is that why is it all why is it never 1.5 times as much right and so
00:28:35 Dalton said well it's because there are 10 atoms and oxygen atoms and one form of tin oxide is one atom of tin and one
00:28:42 atom of oxygen and the other is one atom obtained and two atoms of oxygen and on the basis of this is you know
00:28:48 speculation a theory right a hypothesis but then on the basis of that you make other predictions and the chemists
00:28:53 became quickly convinced that atoms were real the physicists took a lot longer to catch on but eventually they did and I
00:29:01 mean Boltzmann who believed in atoms was God he had a really tough time his whole life because he worked in Germany where
00:29:07 atoms were not popular they were popular in England but not in Germany and there in general the idea of atoms is it's the
00:29:15 most the smallest building block of the universe for for them that's the kind of how the Greek idea but the chemists in
00:29:22 the 1800's jumped the gun a little bit so these days in atom is the smallest building block of a chemical element
00:29:29 right hydrogen tin oxygen carbon whatever but we know that atoms can be broken up further than that and that's
00:29:36 what physicists discovered in the early 1900's Rutherford especially and and his colleagues so the atom that we think
00:29:44 about now the cartoon is that picture you you always seen of a little nucleus and then electrons orbiting it like a
00:29:50 little solar system and we now know the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons so the weight of the atom the mass is
00:29:58 almost all in its nucleus protons and neutrons or something like 1,800 times as heavy as electrons are electrons are
00:30:05 much lighter but they're because they're lighter they give all the life to the atoms so when atoms get together combine
00:30:12 chemically when electricity flows through a system it's all the electrons that are doing all the work
00:30:18 and we're quantum mechanic steps in as you mentioned with position or velocity with classical mechanics and quantum
00:30:25 mechanics is modeling the behavior of the electron I mean you can model the behavior of anything but the electron
00:30:31 because that's where the fun is the electron was it was the biggest challenge right from the start yeah so
00:30:37 what's a wavefunction you said it's an interesting detail yeah but in any interpretation what is the wave function
00:30:45 in quantum mechanics well you know we had this idea from Rutherford that atoms look like little solar systems but
00:30:52 people very quickly realize that can't possibly be right because if an electron is orbiting in a circle it will give off
00:30:58 light all the light that we have in this room comes from electrons zooming up and down and wiggling and that's what
00:31:03 electromagnetic waves are and you can calculate how long would it take for the electron just to spiral into the nucleus
00:31:09 and the answer is 10 to the minus 11 seconds okay a hundred billions of a second so that's not right
00:31:17 meanwhile people had realized that light which we understood from the 1800s was a wave had properties that were similar to
00:31:24 that of particles right this is Einstein and plunk and stuff like that so if something that we agree was a wave had
00:31:33 particle-like properties then maybe something we think is a particle the electron has wave-like properties right
00:31:40 and so a bunch of people eventually came to the conclusion don't think about the electron as a little point particle
00:31:47 orbiting in like a solar system think of it as a wave that is spread out they cleverly gave this the name the wave
00:31:53 function which is the dopiest name in the world for one of the most profound things in the universe the there's
00:31:59 literally you know a number at every point in space which is the value of the electrons wave function at that point
00:32:06 and there's only there's only one wave function that yeah they eventually figured that out that took longer but
00:32:13 when you have two electrons you do not have a wave function for electron one in a wave function for electron two you
00:32:19 have one combined wave function for both of them and indeed as you say there's only one wave function for the entire
00:32:28 universe at once and that's where this beautiful dance can you say what is entanglement it
00:32:34 seems one of the most fundamental ideas of quantum again well let's temporarily buy into the textbook interpretation of
00:32:40 quantum mechanics and what that says is that this wave function so it's very small outside the atom very big in the atom
00:32:47 basically the wave function you take it and you square it you squared the number that gives you the probability of
00:32:54 observing the system at that location so if you say that for two electrons there's only one wave function and that
00:32:59 wave function gives you the probability of observing both electrons at once doing something okay so maybe the
00:33:06 electron can be here or here here here and the other electron can also be there but we have a wave function setup where
00:33:12 we don't know where either electron is going to be seen but we know they'll both be seen in the same place okay so
00:33:19 we don't know exactly what we're gonna see for either electron but there's entanglement between the two of them
00:33:25 there's a sort of conditional statement if we see one in one location then we know the other one's going to be doing a
00:33:31 certain thing so that's a feature of quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be found in classical mechanics in
00:33:36 classical mechanics there's no way I can say well I don't know where either one of these particles is but if I know if I
00:33:40 find out where this one is then I know where the other one is that just never happens they're truly separate and in
00:33:45 general it feels like if you think of a wave function like as a dance floor it seems like entanglement is strongest
00:33:52 between things that are dancing together closest so there's a there's a closeness that's important well that's not that
00:33:58 that's another step we have to be careful here should cause in principle if you if you're talking my the
00:34:03 entanglement of two electrons for example they can be totally entangled or totally unentangled no matter where they are in
00:34:11 the universe there's no relationship between the amount of entanglement and the distance between two electrons but
00:34:19 we now know that you know the reality of our best way of understanding the world is through quantum fields not through
00:34:25 particles so even the electron not just gravity and electromagnetism but even the electron and the quarks and so forth
00:34:32 are really vibrations in quantum fields so even empty space is full of vibrating quantum fields and those quantum fields
00:34:41 in empty space are entangled with each other in exactly the way you just said if they're nearby if you have like two
00:34:46 vibrating quantum fields that are nearby them it'll be highly entangled if they're far away they will not be
00:34:51 entangled so what do quantum fields in a vacuum look like empty space just so like empty space it's as empty as it can
00:34:58 be but there's still a field it's just yeah it  what is nothing just like right here or this location in space
00:35:06 there's a gravitational field which I can detach by dropping something yeah I don't see it but there it is so we got a
00:35:18 little bit of idea of entanglement now what is Hilbert space and Euclidean space yeah you know I think that people
00:35:27 are very welcoming over their lives not knowing what Hilbert space is but if you if you what I dig in a little bit more
00:35:32 into quantum mechanics it becomes necessary you know the English language was invented long before quantum
00:35:39 mechanics or various forms of higher mathematics were invented so we use the word space to mean different things of
00:35:46 course most of us think of space as this three dimensional world in which we live right I mean some of us just think of it
00:35:53 as outer space okay but space around us it gives us the three-dimensional location of things and objects but mathematicians
00:36:03 use any generic abstract collection of elements as a space okay a space of possibilities you know momentum space
00:36:11 etc so Hilbert space is the space of all possible quantum wave functions either for the universe or for some specific system
00:36:18 and it could be an infinite dimensional space or it could be just really really large dimensional but finite we don't
00:36:23 know because we don't know the final theory of everything but this abstract hilbert space is really really really
00:36:29 big and has no immediate connection to the three-dimensional space in which we live what what do dimensions in hilbert
00:36:36 space mean you know it's just a way of mathematically representing how much information is contained in the state of
00:36:42 the system how many numbers do you have to give me to specify what the thing is doing so in classical mechanics I give
00:36:50 you the location of something by giving you three numbers right up down left likes XYZ coordinates but then I might
00:36:58 want to give you its entire state physical state which means both its position and also its velocity the
00:37:04 velocity also has three components so it's state lives in something called phase space which is six dimensional
00:37:10 three dimensions of position three dimensions of velocity and then if it also has an orientation in space that's
00:37:16 another three dimensions and so forth so as you describe more and more information about the system you have an
00:37:23 abstract mathematical space that has more and more numbers that you need to give and each one of those numbers
00:37:28 corresponds to a dimension in that space so in terms of that amount of information what is entropy this mystical word
00:37:39 that's overused in math and physics but has a very specific meaning in this context sadly it has more than one very
00:37:45 specific meeting this is this is reason why it is hard and roomy means different things even to different physicists but
00:37:51 one way of thinking about it is a measure of how much we don't know about the state of a system right so if I have
00:37:59 a bottle of water molecules and I know that okay there's a certain number of water molecules I could weigh it right
00:38:04 and figure out I know the volume of it and I know the temperature and pressure and things like that
00:38:09 I certainly don't know the exact position and velocity of every water molecule right so there's a certain
00:38:14 amount of information I know certain amount that I don't know that is that is part of the complete state of the system
00:38:19 and that's what the entropy characterizes how much unknown information there is the difference
00:38:25 between what I do know about the system and its full exact microscopic state so when we try to describe
00:38:34 a quantum mechanical system is infinite or finite but very large yeah we don't know that depends on the system you know
00:38:42 it's easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentially infinite entropy an infinite dimensional
00:38:49 hilbert space so let's let's go back a little bit we said that the hilbert space was the space in which quantum
00:38:54 wave functions lived for different systems that will be different sizes they could be infinite or finite so
00:39:01 that's the number of numbers the number of pieces information you could potentially give me about the system so
00:39:07 the bigger hilbert spaces the bigger the entropy of that system could be depending on what I know about it if I
00:39:13 don't know anything about it then you know as a huge entropy right but only up to the size of its hilbert space so we
00:39:21 don't know in in the real physical world whether or not you know this region of space that contains that water bottle
00:39:28 has potentially an infinite entropy or just a finite entropy we have we have different arguments on different sides
00:39:33 so if it's infinite how do you think about infinity is this something you can your cognitive abilities are able to
00:39:42 process or is it just a mathematical tool it's somewhere in between right I mean we can say things about it we can
00:39:49 use mathematical tools to manipulate infinity very very accurately we can define what we mean you know for any
00:39:55 number n there's a number bigger than it so there's no biggest number right so there's something called the total
00:40:01 number of all numbers that's infinite but it is hard to wrap your brain around that and I think that gives people pause
00:40:09 because we talk about infinity as if it's a number but it has plenty of properties that real numbers don't have
00:40:13 you know if you multiply infinity by 2 you get infinity again right that's a little bit different than what we're
00:40:21 used to okay but are you comfortable with the idea that in thinking of what the real world actually is that infinity
00:40:28 could be part of that world are you comfortable that a world in some dimension and somehow comfortable with
00:40:34 lots of things I mean you know I don't want my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world you know I'm
00:40:42 pretty open-minded about what the world could be at the fundamental level yeah but infinity is a is a tricky one
00:40:49 it's not almost a question of comfort it's a question of is it an overreach of our intuition sort of it could be a
00:40:59 convenient almost like when you add a constant to an equation just because it'll help it just feels like it's
00:41:06 useful to at least be able to imagine a concept not directly but in some kind of way that this feels like it's a
00:41:14 description of the real world think of it this way there's only three numbers that are simple there's zero there's one
00:41:26 and there's infinity a number like 318 it's just bizarre like that that you need a lot of bits to give me what that
00:41:34 number is yeah but zero and one infinity like once you have 300 things you might as well have infinity things right
00:41:38 otherwise yet to say how when to stop making the thing that's right so there's a sense in which infinity is a very
00:41:45 natural number of things to exist that I was never comfortable with it because it's just such a kick but it was a too
00:41:50 good to be true mmm because in math it just helps make things work out when things get very
00:41:59 it's when things get very large close to infinity things seem to work out nicely it's kind of like because of my deepest
00:42:07 passion it's probably psychology and I'm uncomfortable how in the average the the beauty of the very very the how much we
00:42:19 vary is lost in that same kind of sense infinity seems like convenient way to erase the details but the thing about
00:42:27 infinity is you it seems to pop up whether we like it or not right right like you're trying to be a computer
00:42:32 scientist you ask yourself well how long will it take this program to run and you realize well for some of them the answer
00:42:37 is infinitely long it's not because you tried to get there you wrote a five line computer program
00:42:44 it doesn't halt so coming back to the textbook definition of quantum mechanics this idea that we I don't think we
00:42:52 talked about can you this one of the most interesting philosophical points we talked at the human level but at the
00:43:00 at the physics level that it that at least the textbook definition of quantum mechanics separates what is observed and
00:43:10 what is real one how does that make you feel and and two what does it then mean to observe something and why is it
00:43:20 different that what is real yeah you know I my personal feelings such as it is is that things like measurement and
00:43:30 observers and stuff like that are not going to play a fundamental role in the ultimate laws of physics but my feeling
00:43:36 that way is because so far that's where all the evidence has been pointing I could be wrong and there's certainly a
00:43:42 sense in which it would be infinitely cool if somehow observation or mental cogitation did play a fundamental role
00:43:52 in the in the nature of reality but I don't think so I can I don't see any evidence for it so I'm not spending a
00:43:56 lot of time worrying about that possibility so what do you do about the fact that in the textbook interpretation
00:44:02 of quantum mechanics this idea of measurement or looking at things seems to play an important role well you you
00:44:10 come up with better interpretations of quantum mechanics and there are several alternatives my favorite is the
00:44:15 many-worlds interpretation which says two things number one you the observer are just a quantum system like anything
00:44:23 else there's nothing special about you don't get so proud of yourself you know you're just a bunch of atoms you have a
00:44:29 wavefunction you obey the Schrodinger equation like everything else and number two when you think you're measuring
00:44:35 something or observing something what's really happening is you're becoming entangled with that thing so when you
00:44:42 think there's a wavefunction for the electron it's all spread out but you look at it and you only see it in one
00:44:48 location what's really happening is that there's still the wave functions the electron in all those locations but now
00:44:53 it's entangled with the wave function of you in the following way there's part of the wave function that says the electron
00:44:59 was here and you think you saw it there the electron was there and you think you saw it there the electron was over there
00:45:05 and you think you saw it there etc so and all of those different parts of the wave function once they come into being no
00:45:11 longer talk to each other they no longer interact or influence each other it says if they are separate worlds so this was
00:45:19 the invention of Hugh Everett the third who was a graduate student at Princeton in the 1950s and he said basically look
00:45:26 you don't need all these extra rules about looking at things just listen to what the Schrodinger equation is telling
00:45:32 you it's telling you that you have a wavefunction that you become entangled and that the different versions of you
00:45:38 no longer talk to each other so just accept it it's just he did therapy more than anything else you know he said like
00:45:43 it's okay you know you don't need all these extra rules all you need to do is believe the Schrodinger equation the
00:45:48 cost is there's a whole bunch of extra worlds out there so how the worlds being created whether there's an observer or
00:45:58 not the worlds are created anytime a quantum system that's in a superposition becomes entangled with the outside world
00:46:06 what's the outside world it depends let's back out yeah whatever it really says what his theory
00:46:12 is is there's a wave function of the universe and a base the Schrodinger equation all the time that's it that's the full
00:46:21 theory right there okay the question all of the work is how in the world do you map that theory on to reality on to what
00:46:29 we observe right so part of it is carving up the wavefunction into these separate worlds saying look look it
00:46:35 describes a whole bunch of things that don't interact with each other let's call them separate worlds another part
00:46:40 is distinguishing between systems and their environments and the environment is basically all the degrees of freedom
00:46:45 all the things going on in the world that you don't keep track of so again in the bottle of water I might keep track
00:46:53 of the total amount of water and the volume I don't keep track of the individual positions and velocities I
00:46:58 don't keep track of all the photons or the air molecules in this room so that's the outside world the outside world is
00:47:04 all the parts of the universe that you're not keeping track of when you're asking about the behavior of some
00:47:13 subsystem of it so how many worlds are there you want to know that one either there could be an infinite number there
00:47:20 could be only a finite number but it's a big number one way or the other it's a very very big number
00:47:26 one of you talked somebody asked well if it's a if it's finite so actually I'm not sure exactly the
00:47:36 logic you used to derive this but is there you know going to be the you know overlap a duplicate world that you
00:47:48 return to so you've mentioned and I'd love if you can elaborate on sort of idea that it's possible that there's
00:47:54 some kind of equilibrium that these splitting worlds arrive at and then maybe over time maybe somehow connected
00:48:03 to entropy you get a large number of worlds they're very similar to each other yeah so this question of whether
00:48:10 or not Hilbert space is finite or infinite dimensional is actually secretly connected to gravity and
00:48:17 cosmology this is a the part that we're still struggling to understand right now but we discovered back in 1998 that our
00:48:23 universe is accelerating and what that means if it continues which we think it probably will but we're not sure but if
00:48:29 it does that means there's a horizon around us there there's because the universe not only expanding but
00:48:34 expanding faster and faster things can get so far away from us that from our perspective it looks like they're moving
00:48:40 away faster than the speed of light you'll never see them again so there's literally a horizon around us
00:48:46 and that horizon approaches some fixed distance away from us and you can then argue that within that horizon there's
00:48:53 only a finite number of things that can possibly happen the finite dimensional hilbert space in fact we even have a
00:48:58 guess for what the dimensionality is it's 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 122 that's a very large number yes
00:49:07 just to compare the age of the universe is something like 10 to the 14 seconds 10 to the 17 or 18 seconds maybe the
00:49:14 number of particles in the universe is 10 to the 88th but the number of dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the
00:49:21 10 to the 120 - so that's just crazy thing if that story is right that in our observable horizon there's only a finite
00:49:30 dimensional hilbert space then this idea of branching of the wavefunction the universe into multiple distinct separate
00:49:37 branches has to reach a limit at once you read branched that many times you've run out of room in hilbert space
00:49:43 and roughly speaking that corresponds to the universe just expanding and emptying out and cooling off and and entering a
00:49:50 phase where it's just empty space literally forever what's the difference between splitting and copying do you
00:50:00 think like in terms of a lot of this is an interpretation that's that helps us sort of model the world so perhaps
00:50:13 shouldn't be thought of as like you know philosophically or metaphysically but in even at the physics level do you see a
00:50:23 difference between two generating new copies of the world or splitting I think it's better to think of in quantum
00:50:30 mechanics in many worlds the universe splits rather than new copies because people otherwise worry about things like
00:50:37 energy conservation and no one who understands quantum mechanics worries about energy conservation because the
00:50:42 equation is perfectly clear but if all you know is that someone told you the universe duplicates then you have a
00:50:46 reasonable worry about where all the energy for that came from so a pre-existing universe splitting into two
00:50:53 skinnier universes is a better way of thinking about it and mathematically it's just like you know if you draw an x
00:50:59 and y axis and you draw a vector of length 1 45-degree angle you you know that you can write that
00:51:06 vector of length 1 as the sum of two vectors pointing along x and y of length 1 over the square root of 2 ok
00:51:13 so I write one arrow as the sum of two arrows but there's a conservation of air Onis right like if now two arrows but
00:51:19 the length is the same I just I'm describing it in a different way and that's exactly what happens when the
00:51:25 universe branches the the wave function of the universe is a big old vector so to somebody who brings up a question of
00:51:33 saying doesn't this violate the conservation of energy can you give further elaboration right so let's just
00:51:41 be SuperDuper perfectly clear yeah there's zero question about whether or not many-worlds violates conservation of
00:51:48 energy yes it does not great and I say this definitively because there are other questions
00:51:52 I think there's answers too but they're legitimate questions right about you know where does probability come from
00:51:57 and things like that this conservation of energy question we know the answer to it and the answer to it is that energy
00:52:03 is conserved all of the effort goes into how best to translate what the equation unambiguously says into think plain
00:52:10 English right so this idea that there's a universe that has that that the universe comes
00:52:16 equipped with a thickness and it sort of divides up into thinner pieces but the total amount of universe is is conserved
00:52:23 over time is a reasonably good way of putting English words to the underlying mathematics so one of my favorite things
00:52:32 about many worlds is I mean I love that there's something controversial in science and for some reason it makes
00:52:40 people actually not like upset but just get excited why do you think it is a controversial idea so there's there's a
00:52:49 lot of it's actually one of the cleanest ways to think about quantum mechanics yeah so why do you think there's a
00:52:56 discomfort a little bit among certain people well I draw the distinction of my book between two different kinds of
00:53:03 simplicity in a physical theory there's simplicity in the theory itself right how we describe what's going on
00:53:09 according to the theory by its own rights but then you know a theory is just some sort of abstract mathematical
00:53:14 formalism you have to map it onto the world somehow right and sometimes like for Newtonian physics it's pretty
00:53:23 obvious like okay here is a bottle and as a center of mass and things like that sometimes it's a little bit harder with
00:53:29 general relativity curvature of space-time is a little bit harder to grasp quantum mechanics is very hard to
00:53:36 map what you're the language you're talking into wave functions and things like that on to reality and many worlds
00:53:42 is the version of quantum mechanics where it is hardest to map on the underlying formalism to reality so
00:53:49 that's where the lack of simplicity comes in not in the theory but in how we use the theory to map on to reality and
00:53:56 in fact all of the work in sort of elaborating many-worlds quantum mechanics is in the this effort to map
00:54:04 it on to the world that we see so it's perfectly legitimate to be bugged by that right to say like well no that's
00:54:13 just too far away from my experience I I am therefore intrinsically skeptical of it of course you should give up on that
00:54:18 skepticism if there are no alternatives and this theory always keeps working then eventually you should overcome your
00:54:23 skepticism but right now there are alternatives and that are that you know people work to make alternatives that
00:54:30 are by their nature closer to what we observe directly can you describe the alternatives I don't think we touched on
00:54:36 it so the the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds maybe there's a difference between the
00:54:44 effort I've already in many worlds and many worlds it is now like has the idea sort of developed and so on and just in
00:54:53 general what is the space of promising contenders we have democratic debates now there's a bunch of candidate well family of
00:54:59 candidates on stage what are the quantum-mechanical candidates on stage for the debate so if you had a debate
00:55:06 between quantum-mechanical contenders there would be no problem getting 12 people up there on stage but there would
00:55:13 still be only three frontrunners and right now the frontrunners would be Evert hidden variable theories are
00:55:20 another one so the hidden variable theories say that the wavefunction is real but there's something in addition
00:55:26 to the wave function the wave function is not everything is part of reality but it's not everything what else is there
00:55:33 we're not for but in the simplest version of the theory there are literally particles so many world says
00:55:40 that quantum systems are sometimes are wave-like in some ways and particle-like in another because they really really
00:55:47 are waves but under certain observational circumstances they look like particles whereas invariable says
00:55:53 there they look like waves and particles because there are both waves and particles involved in the dynamics and
00:56:00 that's easy to do if your particles are just nonrelativistic Newtonian particles moving around they get pushed around by
00:56:08 the wave function roughly it becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory or quantum gravity into account
00:56:15 the other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories so in the conventional textbook
00:56:21 interpretation we say when you look at a quantum system its wavefunction collapses and you see it in one location
00:56:27 a spontaneous collapse theory says that every particle has a chance per second of having its wavefunction spontaneously
00:56:37 collapse the chance is very small for a typical particle it will take hundreds of millions of years before it happens
00:56:42 even once but in a table or some macroscopic object there are way more than a hundred million particles and
00:56:48 they're all entangled with each other so when one of them clacks it collapses it brings everything else along with it
00:56:54 there's a slight variation of this that's a spontaneous collapse theory there are also induced collapse theories
00:56:59 like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational difference between two parts of the wave function becomes too
00:57:05 large the wavefunction collapses automatically so those are basically in my mind the three big alternatives many
00:57:12 worlds which is just there's a wave function and always a basis reading your equation hidden variables there's a wave
00:57:17 function that always the basis Schrodinger equation but there are also new variables or collapse theories which
00:57:24 the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger equation and sometimes it collapses so you can see that the
00:57:29 alternatives are more complicated in their formalism than many-worlds is but they are closer to our experience so
00:57:37 just this moment of collapse do you think of it as so is a wave function fundamentally sort of a probabilistic
00:57:45 description of the world and its collapse sort of reducing that part of the world into something deterministic
00:57:53 or again you can now describe the position in the velocity in this simple classical model well there is a hard
00:57:59 thing about collapse there is a fourth category is a 4th contender there's a mayor Pete of quantum mechanical
00:58:05 interpretations which are called epistemic interpretations and what they say is all the wavefunction is is a way
00:58:13 of making predictions for experimental outcomes it's not mapping on to an element of reality in any real sense and
00:58:20 in fact two different people might have two different wave functions for the same physical system because they know
00:58:25 different things about it right the wave function is really just a prediction mechanism and then the problem with
00:58:31 those epistemic interpretations is if you say okay but it's predicting about what like what
00:58:38 is the thing that is being predicted and I say no no that's not what we're here for we're just here to tell you what the
00:58:44 observational outcomes are gonna be but the other the other interpretation is kind of think that the wavefunction is
00:58:52 real yes that's right so that's an antic interpretation of the wavefunction ontology being the study of what is real
00:58:58 what exists as opposed to an epistemic interpretation of the wavefunction epistemology being the study what we
00:59:03 know now actually just love to see that debate on stage there was a version of it on stage at the world science
00:59:10 festival a few years ago that you can look up online I need you yep that's all you do okay awesome I'll
00:59:21 link it and watch it anyone I won there was no vote those there's Brian Greene was the moderator and David Albert stood
00:59:28 up for spontaneous collapse and Shelley Goldstein was there for hidden variables and Ruettiger shock was there for
00:59:35 epistemic approaches why do you I think you mentioned it but just why do you find many worlds so compelling well
00:59:44 there's two reasons actually one is like I said it is the simplest right it's like the most bare-bones austere pure
00:59:50 version of quantum mechanics and I am someone who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism onto
00:59:57 reality I'm less willing to complicate the formalism itself but the other big reason is that there's something called
01:00:04 modern physics with quantum fields and quantum gravity and holography and space-time doing things like that and
01:00:11 when you take any of the other versions of quantum theory they bring along classical baggage all of the other
01:00:19 versions of quantum mechanics prejudice or privilege some version of classical reality like locations in space okay and
01:00:29 I think that that's a barrier to doing better at understanding the theory of everything and understanding quantum
01:00:33 gravity and the emergence of space-time whenever if you change your theory from you know here's a harmonic oscillator oh
01:00:40 there's a spin here's an electromagnetic field in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse theories you have to
01:00:45 start from scratch what are the hidden variables for this theory or how does he collapse or whatever
01:00:50 whereas many-worlds is plug-and-play you tell me the theory and I can give you as many worlds version so when we have a
01:00:56 situation like we have with gravity and space-time where the classical description seems to break down in a
01:01:03 dramatic way then I think you should start from the most quantum theory that you have which is really many worlds so
01:01:10 start with the quantum theory and try to build up a model of space-time the emergence of space-time that's okay so I
01:01:21 thought space-time was fundamental yeah I know so this sort of dream that Einstein had that everybody had and
01:01:29 everybody has of you know the theory of everything so how do we build up from many worlds from quantum mechanics a
01:01:38 model of space-time model of gravity well yeah I mean let me first mention very quickly why we think it's necessary
01:01:45 you know we've had gravity in the form that Einstein bequeathed it to us for over a hundred years now
01:01:50 like 1915 or 1916 he put general relativity in the final form so gravity is the curvature of space-time and
01:01:57 there's a field that pervades all the universe that tells us how curved space-time is and that's a fundamentally
01:02:03 classical that's totally classical right exactly but we also have a formalism an algorithm for taking a classical theory
01:02:11 and quantizing it this is how we get quantum electrodynamics for example and it could be tricky I mean you think your
01:02:18 quantizing something so that means taking a classical theory and promoting it to a quantum mechanical theory but
01:02:24 you can run into problems so they ran into problems and you did that with electromagnetism namely that certain
01:02:29 quantities were infinity and you don't like infinity right so Fineman and tominaga and Schwinger won the nobel
01:02:35 prize for teaching us how to deal with the infinities and then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize for saying you
01:02:39 shouldn't have been worried about those infinities after all but still that was the it's always the thought that that's
01:02:45 how you will make a good quantum theory you'll start with the classical theory and quantize it so if we have a
01:02:50 classical theory general relativity we can quantize it or we can try to but we run into even bigger problems with
01:02:56 gravity than we ran into with electromagnetism and so far those problems are
01:03:01 we've not been able to get a successful theory of gravity quantum gravity by starting with classical general
01:03:08 relativity and quantum it and there's evidence that there's a good reason why this is true that the whatever the
01:03:15 quantum theory of gravity is it's not a field theory it's something that has weird non-local features built into it
01:03:22 somehow that we don't understand and we get this idea from black holes and Hawking radiation and information
01:03:28 conservation and a whole bunch of other ideas I talked about in the book so if that's true if the fundamental theory
01:03:34 isn't even local in the sense that an ordinary quantum field theory would be then we just don't know where to start
01:03:40 in terms of getting a classical precursor and quantizing so the only sensible thing is at least the next
01:03:46 obvious sensible thing to me would be to say okay let's just start intrinsically quantum and work backwards see if we can
01:03:52 find a classical limit so the idea of locality the the fact that locality is not fundamental to the nature of our
01:04:04 existence sort of you know I guess in that sense modeling everything's the field makes sense to me stuff that's
01:04:10 close by interact stuff that's far away doesn't so what's what's locality and why is it not fundamental and how is
01:04:16 that even possible yeah I mean locality is the answer to the question that Isaac Newton was
01:04:21 worried about back in the beginning of our conversation right I mean how can the earth know what the gravitational
01:04:28 field of the Sun is when the answer has spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and others is that there's a field in
01:04:33 between and the way a field works is that what's happening to the field at this point in space only depends
01:04:40 directly on what's happening at points right next to it but what's happening at those points depends on what's happening
01:04:45 right next to those right is you can build up an influence across space through only local interactions that's
01:04:52 what locality means what happens here is only affected by what's happening right next to it that's locality the idea of
01:04:59 locality is built into every field theory including general relativity as a classical theory it seems to break down
01:05:06 when we talk about black holes and you know Hawking taught us in the 1970s the black holes radiate they give off
01:05:12 they'll eventually evaporate away they're not completely black once we take quantum
01:05:18 mechanics into account and we think we don't know for sure but most of us think that if you make a black hole out of
01:05:26 certain stuff then like Laplace's Demon taught us you should be able to predict what that black hole will turn into if
01:05:31 it's just obeying the Schrodinger equation and if that's true there are good arguments that can't happen while
01:05:38 preserving locality at the same time it's just that their information seems to be spread out non locally in
01:05:45 interesting ways and people should you talk about holography with the Leonard Susskind on your - a podcast
01:05:51 yes I have a podcast I didn't even mention that I'm terrible no I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you questions about that
01:05:57 too and I've been not shutting up about it's my favorite science podcast so or not it's a famous science podcast it's
01:06:07 like it's a scientist doing absolutely yes yeah anyway yeah so holography is this idea when you have a black hole and
01:06:14 black hole is a region of space inside of which gravity is so strong that you can't escape and there's this weird
01:06:20 feature of black holes that again is a totally a thought experiment feature cuz we haven't gone and probed any yet but
01:06:26 there seems to be one way of thinking about what happens inside a black hole as seen by an observer who's falling in
01:06:33 which is actually pretty normal like everything looks pretty normal until you get the singularity and you die but from
01:06:38 the point of the view of the outside observer it seems like all the information that that fell in is
01:06:46 actually smeared over the horizon in a non-local way and that's puzzling and that's a lot so holography because
01:06:51 that's a two-dimensional surface that is encapsulating the whole three-dimensional thing inside right
01:06:56 still trying to deal with that still trying to figure out how to get there but it's an indication that we need to
01:07:00 think a little more subtly when we quantize gravity so because you can describe everything that's going on in
01:07:07 the in three-dimensional space by looking at the two-dimensional projection of it that means that
01:07:15 locality doesn't it's not necessary well it means it's somehow it's only a good approximation it's not really what's
01:07:21 going on how we're supposed to feel about that supposed to be liberated you know space is just a good
01:07:29 approximation and this was always gonna be true once you started quantizing gravity so we're just beginning now to
01:07:37 face up to the dramatic implications of quantizing gravity is there other weird stuff that happens to quantum mechanics
01:07:44 in black hole I don't think that anything weird happen with quantum mechanics thinking weird things happen
01:07:49 with space-time I mean that's what it is like quantum mechanics is still just quantum mechanics but our ordinary
01:07:56 notions of space-time don't really quite work and there's a principle that goes hand in hand with holography called
01:08:06 complementarity which says that there's no one unique way to describe what's going on inside a black hole different
01:08:12 observers will have different descriptions both of which are accurate but sound completely incompatible with
01:08:19 each other so depends on how you look at it you know the word complementarity in this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr
01:08:25 who points out you can measure the position or you can measure the momentum you can't measure both at the same time
01:08:32 in quantum mechanics so a couple questions on many worlds how does many worlds help us understand our particular
01:08:41 branch of reality so ok that's fine and good that is everything is splitting we're just traveling down a single
01:08:48 branch of it so how does it help us understand our little unique branch yeah I mean that's a great question but
01:08:54 that's the point is that we didn't invent many worlds cuz you thought it was cool to have a whole bunch of worlds
01:08:59 right we invented it because we were trying to account for what we observe here in our world and what we observe
01:09:05 here in our world are wave functions collapsing ok we do have a position as a situation where the electron seems to be
01:09:12 spread out but then when we look at it we don't see it spread out we see it located somewhere so what's going on
01:09:17 that's the measurement problem of quantum mechanics that's what we have to face up to so many worlds is just a
01:09:22 proposed solution to that problem and the answer is nothing special is happening it's still just the
01:09:28 Schrodinger equation but you have a wave function - and that's a different answer than would be given in hidden variables
01:09:34 or dynamical collapse theories or whatever so the entire point of many world's is to explain what we observe
01:09:42 but it tries to explain what we already have observed right it's not trying to be different from what we've observed
01:09:48 because that would be something other than quantum mechanics but you know the idea that there's worlds that we didn't
01:09:54 observe they keep branching off it's kind of it is  you know it's stimulating to the imagination so is it
01:10:04 possible to hop from you mentioned the branches are independent yes is it possible to hop from one to the other
01:10:13 no it's so physical limit then the theory says it's impossible there's already a copy of you in the other world
01:10:19 don't worry yes leave them alone no but there's a there's a fear of missing out form oh yes that I feel like
01:10:29 immediately start to wander if that other copy is having more or less fun well the downside in many worlds is that
01:10:38 you're missing out on an enormous and that's always what it's gonna be like and I mean there's a certain stage of
01:10:45 acceptance and that yes in terms of rewinding you think we can rewind the system back sort of the the nice thing
01:10:53 about many worlds I guess is it really emphasizes the maybe you can correct me but to determine it the deterministic
01:11:02 nature of a branch and it feels like it could be a while back is it is do you see is this something that could be
01:11:12 perfectly won back rewinded back yeah you know if you're at a fancy French restaurant yeah there's a nice linen
01:11:17 white tablecloth and you have your glass of Bordeaux and you knock it over and the wine spills across the tablecloth if
01:11:26 the world were classical okay it would be possible that if you just lifted the wine glass up you'd be lucky enough that
01:11:32 every molecule of wine would hop back into the glass right but guess what it's not going to happen in the real world
01:11:38 and the quantum wave function is exactly the same way it is possible in principle to rewind everything if you start from
01:11:45 perfect knowledge of the entire wave function of the universe in practice that's never gonna happen
01:11:52 so time travel not possible nope at least one mechanic says no help what about memory does the universe have
01:12:05 a memory of itself where we could in in it's a not time travel but peek back in time and do a little like replay well
01:12:16 it's exactly the same in quantum mechanics as classical mechanics so whatever you want to say about that you
01:12:22 know the fundamental laws of physics in either many worlds quantum mechanics or Newtonian physics conserve information
01:12:30 so if you have all the information about the quantum state of the world right now your Laplace's demon-like in your
01:12:36 knowledge and calculational capacity you can wind the clock backward but none of us is right and you know so in practice
01:12:43 you could never do that you can do experiments over and over again starting from the same initial conditions for
01:12:48 small systems but once things get to be large Avogadro's number of particles write bigger than a cell no chance we
01:12:57 we've talked a little bit about arrow of time last time but in many worlds that there is a kind of implied arrow of time
01:13:09 right so you've talked about the arrow of time that has to do with the second law of thermodynamics
01:13:16 that's the arrow of time that's emergent or fundamental we don't know I guess no it's emergent it's a is that there's
01:13:24 everyone agree on that well nobody's everything so that area of time is that different in the arrow of time that's
01:13:34 implied by many worlds it's not different actually no in both cases you have fundamental laws of physics that
01:13:41 are completely reversible if you give me the state of the universe at one moment in time I can run the clock forward or
01:13:46 backward equally well there's no arrow of time built into the laws of physics at the most fundamental level but what
01:13:54 we do have are special initial conditions 14 billion years ago near the Big Bang in thermodynamics those special
01:14:01 initial conditions take the form of things were low entropy and entropy has been increasing ever since making the
01:14:08 universe more disorganized and chaotic and that's the arrow of time in quantum mechanics these special initial
01:14:14 conditions take the form of there was only one branch of the wavefunction and the universe has been branching more and
01:14:23 more ever since ok so if time is emergent so it seems like our human cognitive capacity likes to take things
01:14:31 that are emergent and assume in feel like they're fundamental so what it sequence of times emergent and locality
01:14:44 like space emergent yes ok but I didn't say time was merge and I said the arrow of time was emergent those are different
01:14:50 what's the difference between the arrow of time and time are using arrow of time to simply mean this the synonymous with
01:14:58 the second law thermodynamics no but the arrow of time is the difference between the past and future so all right there's
01:15:04 space but there's no arrow of space you don't feel that space has to have an arrow right you could live in
01:15:09 thermodynamic equilibrium there be no arrow of time but there'd still be time it'd still be a difference between now
01:15:16 and the future also ok so if nothing changes there's still time well things could even change like if the whole
01:15:23 universe consisted of the earth going around the Sun yeah ok it would just go in circles or ellipses right that's not
01:15:30 every things would change but it's not increasing entropy there's no arrow if you took a movie of that and I played
01:15:35 you the movie backward you would never know so the arrow of time can theoretically point in the other
01:15:46 direction for brief briefly so intent that it points in different directions it's not a very good arrow I mean the
01:15:51 arrow of time in the macroscopic world is so powerful that there's just no chance of going back when you get down
01:15:57 to tiny systems with only three or four moving parts then entropy can fluctuate up and down what does it mean for space
01:16:03 to be an emergent phenomena it means that the fundamental description of the world does not include the word space
01:16:08 it'll be something like a vector in Hilbert space right and you have to say well why is there a good approximation
01:16:15 scription which involves three dementia space and stuff inside it okay so time and space or immersion we kind of
01:16:23 mentioned it in the beginning but can you elaborate what do you feel hope is fundamental in our universe a
01:16:31 wavefunction living in hilbert space wave function and hilbert space that we can't intellectualize or visualize really
01:16:38 we can't visualize it we can intellectualize it very easily like well how do you think about it's a vector in
01:16:44 a 10 to the 10 to the 120 2-dimensional vector space it's a complex vector unit norm it evolves according the
01:16:52 Schrodinger equation got it when you put it that way what's so hard really yep quantum computers there's some
01:17:04 excitement actually a lot of excitement with people that it will allow us to simulate quantum mechanical systems what
01:17:12 kind of questions do about quantum mechanics about the things we've been talking about do you think do you hope
01:17:20 we can answer through quantum simulation well I think that there are there's a whole fascinating frontier of things you
01:17:27 can do with quantum computers both sort of practical things with cryptography or money privacy eavesdropping sorting
01:17:39 things simulating quantum systems right so it's a it's a broader question maybe even outside of quantum computers some
01:17:46 of the theories that we've been talking about what's your hope what's most promising to test these theories what
01:17:54 are what are kind of experiments we can conduct whether in simulation or in the physical world that would validate or
01:18:03 disprove or expand these theories well I think for the there's two parts of that question one is many worlds and the
01:18:10 other one is sort of emergent space-time for many worlds you know there are experiments on going to test whether or
01:18:15 not wavefunction spontaneously collapse and if they do then that rules out many worlds and that will be falsified what
01:18:23 if there are hidden variables there's a theorem that seems to indicate that the predictions will always be the same as
01:18:30 many worlds I'm a little skeptical this theorem I'm not completely I haven't internalized it haven't made it in part
01:18:35 of my intuitive view of the world yet so there might be loopholes to that theorem I'm not sure about that I part of me
01:18:40 thinks that there should be different experimental predictions if there are hidden variables but I'm not sure but
01:18:46 otherwise it's just quantum mechanics all the way down and so there's there's this cottage industry in science
01:18:52 journalism of writing breathless articles that say you know quantum mechanics shown to be more astonishing
01:18:58 than ever before thought and really it's the same quantum mechanics we've been doing since 1926 whereas with the
01:19:04 emergent space-time stuff we know a lot less about what the theory is it's in a very primitive state we don't even
01:19:11 really have a safely written down respectable honest theory yet so there could very well be experimental
01:19:17 predictions we just don't know about yet that is one of the things that we're trying to figure out me before emergence
01:19:23 space-time you need a really big stuff all right well or really fast stuff or really
01:19:28 energetic stuff we don't know that that's the thing you know so there could be violations of the speed of light if
01:19:36 you have a version space-time not going faster than the speed of light but the speed of light could be different for
01:19:41 light of different wavelengths right that would be a dramatic violation of physics as we know it but it could be
01:19:47 possible or not I mean it's not an absolutely prediction as that's that's the problem the theories are just not
01:19:54 well developed enough yet to say is there anything that quantum mechanics can teach us about human nature or the
01:20:02 human mind do you think about sort of consciousness and these kinds of topics is there it's certainly excessively used
01:20:11 as you point out the word quantum is used for everything besides quantum mechanics but in more seriousness is
01:20:22 there something that goes to the human level and can help us understand our mind not really is the short answer
01:20:30 you know minds are pretty classical I don't think we don't know this for sure but I don't think that phenomena like
01:20:37 entanglement are crucial to how the human mind works or about consciousness so you mentioned I think early on in the Commerce
01:20:47 you said it would be I'm a it would be unlikely but incredible if sort of the observer somehow a fundamental part yeah
01:20:58 so observer not to romanticize the notion but seems interlink to the idea of consciousness so if consciousness as
01:21:05 the pant site because believe is fundamental to the universe is that possible is that wait I mean every
01:21:14 possible just say Joe Rogan likes to say it's entirely possible but ok but is it on a spectrum of crazy out there how how
01:21:26 the statistic is speaking how often do you ponder the possibility that consciousness is fundamental or the
01:21:32 observer is fundamental to personally don't at all there are people who do I'm a thorough physical estate company side
01:21:39 I do not think that there are any separate mental states or mental properties I think they're all emergent
01:21:44 just like space-time is and you know space-time is hard enough to understand so the fact that we don't yet understand
01:21:49 consciousness is not at all surprising to you as we mentioned have an amazing podcast called mindscape it's as I said
01:22:00 on my favorite podcast sort of both for your explanation of physics which a lot of people of and when you venture out
01:22:08 into things that are beyond your expertise but it's just a really smart person exploring even questions like you
01:22:19 know morality for example it's very interesting I think you did a solo episode and so on I mean there's a lot
01:22:24 of really interesting conversations that you have what are what are some from memory amazing conversations that pop to
01:22:35 mind you've had what did you learn from them something that maybe changed your mind and just inspired you or just what
01:22:41 do this whole experience of having conversations what stands out to you it's an unfair question totally unfair
01:22:49 that's okay that's alright you know it's often the ones I feel like the the ones I do on physics and closely related
01:22:56 science or even philosophy ones are like I know this stuff and I'm helping people learn about it but I
01:23:04 learned more from the ones that nothing to do with physics or philosophy right so talking to Wynton Marsalis about jazz
01:23:10 or talking to a Master Sommelier about wine talking to will Wilkinson about partisan polarization and the
01:23:17 urban-rural divide talking to psychologists like Carol Tavarez about cognitive dissonance and and how those
01:23:27 things work scott derrickson who is the director of the movie dr. strange I had a wonderful conversation with him where
01:23:33 we went through the mechanics of making a blockbuster superhero movie right and he's also not a naturalist he's a he's a
01:23:40 evangelical Christian so we talked about the nature of reality there I want to have a couple more you know
01:23:48 discussions with highly educated theists who know the theology really well but I haven't quite
01:23:57 arranged those yet I would love to hear that I mean that's how comfortable are you venturing into questions of religion
01:24:04 well I'm totally comfortable doing it you know I did talk with Alan Lightman who is also an atheist but he he is
01:24:12 trying to rescue the sort of spiritual side of things for atheism and I did talk to very vocal atheists like Alex
01:24:22 Rosenberg so I need to talk to some I talked to some religious believers and he talked more how have you changed
01:24:30 through having all these conversations you know part of the motivation was I had a long stack of books that I hadn't
01:24:36 read and I couldn't find time to read them and I figured if I interviewed their authors forcing me to read them
01:24:41 right and that's that is totally worked by the way now I'm annoyed that people write such long books I think I'm still
01:24:48 very much learning how to be a good interviewer I think that's a skill that  you know I I think I have good
01:24:54 questions but you know there's the give-and-take that is still I think I could be better at like I want to offer
01:25:01 something to the conversation but not too much right I've had conversations where I barely talked at all and I have
01:25:06 conversations where I talked half the time I think there's a happy medium in between there so I think I remember
01:25:12 listening to without mentioning names some of your conversations where I wish you would have disagreed more yeah as a listener
01:25:21 it's more fun sometimes it well this is that's a very good question because you know my everyone has an attitude toward
01:25:27 that like some people are really there to basically give their point of view and the they're their guest is supposed
01:25:35 to you know respond accordingly I I want to sort of get my view on the record but I don't want to dwell on it when I'm
01:25:42 talking to someone like David Chalmers who I disagree with a lot you know I want to say like here's why I disagree
01:25:48 with you but you know I want we're here to listen to you like I have a Pepa sowed every week and you only own once a
01:25:54 week right and so I have enough coming podcast episode with Philip golf who is much more dedicated pants I kissed and so
01:26:03 there we really get into it I think that I probably have disagreed with him more on that episode than I ever have with
01:26:08 another podcast guest but that's what he wanted so it worked very well yes yeah that kind of debate structure is
01:26:16 beautiful when it's done right like when you're when you can detect that the intent is that you have fundamental
01:26:23 respect for the person yeah that and that's for some reason it's super fun to listen to when two really smart people
01:26:30 are just arguing and sometimes lose their a little bit if I may say well there's a fine line because I have
01:26:38 zero interest in bringing I mean like I mean it may be maybe you implied this I have zero interest in bringing on people
01:26:43 for whom I don't have any intellectual respect like I constantly get requests like you know bring on a flat earth or
01:26:49 whatever and really slap them down or a creationist like I'm at zero interest I'm happy to bring on you know a
01:26:56 religious person a believer but I want someone who's smart and can act in good faith and can talk not a charlatan or a
01:27:03 lunatic right so I will only I will happily bring on people with whom I disagree but only people from who I
01:27:09 think the audience can learn something interesting so let me ask the idea of Charlton is an interesting idea you
01:27:17 might be more educated on this topic than me but there's there's folks for example who argue of various aspects of
01:27:29 evolution sort of try to approach and say that evolution sort of our current theory of evolution has many holes in it
01:27:38 as many flaws and they argue that I think like Cambridge Cambrian explosion that which is like a
01:27:48 huge added variability of species doesn't make sense under our current description of evolution to a theory of
01:27:55 evolution sort of if you had were to have the conversation with people like that how do you know that they're the
01:28:02 difference being outside the box thinkers and people who are fundamentally unscientific and
01:28:13 even bordering on charlatans it's a great question and you know the further you get away from my expertise the
01:28:19 harder it is for me to really judge exactly those things and you know yeah I don't have a satisfying answer for that
01:28:25 one because I think the example you use of someone who you know believes in the basic structure of natural selection but
01:28:32 thinks that you know this particular thing cannot be understood in the terms of our current understanding of Darwinism
01:28:39 that's a perfect edge case where it's hard to tell right and I would have to I would try to talk to people who I do
01:28:45 respect and who do know things and I would have to you know given that I'm a physicist I know that physicists will
01:28:52 sometimes be too dismissive of alternative points of view I have to take into account that biologists can
01:28:57 also be too dismissive of alternative points of view so yeah that's a tricky one have you gotten heat yet yeah all
01:29:04 the time like there's always something I mean it's it's hilarious cuz I do have I try very hard not to like have the same
01:29:12 topic several times in a row I did have like to climate change episodes but they were from very different perspectives
01:29:17 but I like to mix it up that's the whole puzzle I'm having fun and every time I do an episode someone says oh the person
01:29:22 you should really get on to talk about exactly that is this other person like well I don't but I did that now I want
01:29:30 to do that well I hope you keep doing it you're inspiring millions of people your books your podcasts Sean it's an honor
