00:00:02 the following is a conversation with michael i jordan a professor at berkeley and one
00:00:06 of the most influential people in the history of machine learning statistics
00:00:11 and artificial intelligence he has been cited over 170 thousand times and has mentored many of the world-class
00:00:18 researchers defining the field of ai today including andrew eng zubin garamani bentascar and
00:00:28 yoshio banjo all this to me is as impressive as the over 32 of the michael
00:00:38 j jordan of basketball fame there's a non-zero probability that i talked to the other michael jordan
00:00:44 given my connection to and love the chicago bulls of the 90s but if i had to pick one i'm going with
00:00:49 the michael jordan of statistics and computer science or as john le calls him
00:00:56 the miles davis of machine learning in his blog post titled artificial intelligence the revolution hasn't
00:01:01 happened yet michael argues for broadening the scope or the artificial intelligence field
00:01:07 in many ways the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same to see artificial intelligence
00:01:14 as a deeply human endeavor to not only engineer algorithms and robots but to understand and empower human beings
00:01:22 at all levels of abstractions from the individual to our civilization as a whole this is the artificial intelligence podcast
00:01:30 if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube give it five stars at apple podcast
00:01:35 support it on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter as usual i'll do one or two minutes of
00:01:46 ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation i hope that works for you and doesn't
00:01:53 hurt the listening experience this show is presented by cash app the number one finance app in the app store
00:02:01 when you get it use code lex podcast cash app unless you send money to friends buy bitcoin
00:02:06 and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar since cash app does fractional share
00:02:11 trading let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes
00:02:16 to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is to me an algorithmic marvel so big
00:02:23 props for the cash app engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface
00:02:29 that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market making trading more accessible for new investors
00:02:38 and diversification much easier so once again if you get cash app from the app store or google play
00:02:44 and use the code lex podcast you'll get ten dollars and cash app will also donate ten
00:02:49 dollars the first one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and stem education for young people
00:02:58 around the world and now here's my conversation with michael i jordan given that you're one of the greats in
00:03:05 the field of ai machine learning computer science and so on you're trivially called the michael
00:03:12 jordan of machine learning although as you know you were born first so technically mj is the michael i
00:03:20 jordan of basketball but anyway my my favorite is yan la calling you the miles davis
00:03:26 of machine learning because as he says you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave
00:03:31 fans scratching their heads after you change direction so can you put at first your historian hat on
00:03:38 and give a history of computer science and ai as you saw it as you experienced it including
00:03:45 the four generations of ai successes that i've seen you talk about sure yeah first of all i much prefer yon's
00:03:56 metaphor miles davis is  was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story so i think i have one and
00:04:03 but it's not just the one you live it's the one you think about later what a good historian does is they
00:04:10 look back and they revisit i think what happening right now is not ai that was an intellectual aspiration
00:04:17 that's still alive today is an aspiration but i think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering
00:04:23 from chemistry or electrical engineering from from electromagnetism so if you go back to the 30s or 40s
00:04:30 there wasn't yet chemical engineering there was chemistry there was fluid flow there was
00:04:36 mechanics and so on but people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals try to build factories that
00:04:42 you make chemicals products and do it viably safely make good ones do it at scale
00:04:49 so people started to try to do that of course and some factories worked some didn't you know some were not viable some
00:04:55 exploded but in parallel developed a whole field called chemical engineering right and chemical
00:04:59 engineering is a field it's it's no no bones about it it has theoretical aspects to it it has
00:05:05 practical aspects it's not just engineering quote unquote it's the real thing real concepts are needed
00:05:09 same thing with electrical engineering you know there was maxwell's equations which in some sense
00:05:14 were everything you know about electromagnetism but you needed to figure out how to build circuits how to
00:05:19 build modules how to put them together how to bring electricity from one point to another
00:05:23 safely and so on so forth so whole field is developed called electrical engineering all right i think that's what's
00:05:28 happening right now is that we have we have a proto field which is statistics compute more
00:05:34 the theoretical side of the algorithmic side of computer science that was enough to start to build things
00:05:39 but what things systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions
00:05:46 the engineering side of that is all ad hoc that's what's emerging in fact if you want to call machine learning a field
00:05:52 i think that's what it is that's a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations
00:05:57 but do you think there's something deeper about ai in his dreams and aspirations as compared to chemical engineering and
00:06:04 electrical engineering well the dreams and aspirations maybe but those are from those are
00:06:08 500 years from now i think that that's like the greek sitting there and saying it would be neat to get to the moon someday
00:06:14 right i hate we have no clue how the brain does computation  we're just a clueless we're like we're even worse
00:06:19 than the greeks almost anything interesting  scientifically of our era
00:06:25 can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique but a little bit
00:06:31 unique in that in the clarity of that can you can you elaborate your intuition of why we like where we stand in our
00:06:37 understanding of the human brain and a lot of people say you know scientists say we're not very far in
00:06:41 understanding human brain but you're like you're saying we're in the dark here well i know i'm not unique
00:06:47 i don't even think in the clarity but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really study real
00:06:52 synapses or real neurons they agree they agree it's a hundred year hundreds of year tasks and they're building it up slowly surely
00:07:00 what the signal is there is not clear we think we have all of our metaphors we think it's electrical maybe it's
00:07:06 chemical it's a whole soup it's ions and proteins and it's a cell and that's even around like a single
00:07:11 synapse if you look at a electromicrograph of a single synapse it's a it's a city of its own
00:07:17 and that's one little thing on a dendritic tree which is extremely complicated you know electrochemical thing
00:07:23 and it's doing these spikes and voltages have been flying around and then proteins are taking that and
00:07:27 taking it down into the dna and who knows what so it is the problem of the next few centuries it is
00:07:34 fantastic but we have our metaphors about it is it an economic device is it like the immune system or is it like a layered
00:07:40 you know set of copy you know arithmetic computations what we have all these metaphors and they're
00:07:45 fun but that's not real science per se there is neuroscience that's not neuroscience
00:07:51 all right that that's that's like the greek speculating about how to get to the moon
00:07:56 fun right and i think that i like to say this fairly strongly because i think a lot of young people think we're on the verge
00:08:02 because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly let it be understood that yes we kind of this is
00:08:06 brain inspired we're kind of close you know breakthroughs are on the horizon and unscrupulous people sometimes who
00:08:13 need money for their labs as i'm saying scrupulous but people will oversell i need money from a lab
00:08:18 i'm gonna i'm studying here you know computational neuroscience i'm gonna oversell it and so there's
00:08:25 been too much of that so i'll step into the slight the gray area between metaphor and engineering
00:08:32 with  i'm not sure if you're familiar with brain computer interfaces so a company like elon musk has neural link
00:08:41 that's working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read both read
00:08:46 and send electrical signals just as you said even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we
00:08:55 understand but do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works
00:09:02 we'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor it's not my area so i i hope
00:09:09 in the sense like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research i would expect more something like
00:09:15 alzheimer's will get figured out from modern neuroscience that you know a lot of there's a lot of human suffering
00:09:20 based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain it kind of works no one has a clue why
00:09:26 that's not quite true but you know mostly we don't know and that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain
00:09:32 and how it leads to mood swings and so on how thought emerges from that we just we were really really completely dim
00:09:39 so that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns
00:09:45 fine you know by all means go for it it's just not scientific at this point it's just it's so it's like kind of
00:09:51 sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to affirm things about the micro economy even though you
00:09:57 don't have microeconomic concepts i mean it's really that kind of thing and so yes can you find some signals
00:10:02 that do something interesting or useful can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain yeah absolutely you know
00:10:08 and then i can imagine business models based on that and even
00:10:13 you know medical applications of that but from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to
00:10:19 really tie in deeply to from the brain to computer you know i just no i don't agree with elon musk i don't think
00:10:24 that's even that's not for our generation it's not even for the century so just  in hopes of getting you to dream
00:10:32  you've mentioned kolmogorov and touring might pop up do you think that there might be breakthroughs
00:10:40 they'll get you to sit back in five ten years and say wow oh i'm sure there will be but i
00:10:46 don't think that there'll be demos that impress me i don't think that having a computer
00:10:53 call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough and people you know some people present it as such
00:11:01 it's imitating human intelligence it's even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt
00:11:07 and so fine the world runs on those things too and i don't want to diminish all the
00:11:14 hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and and the ultimate value to the human race
00:11:19 but that's not scientific understanding and and i know the people who work on these things they are after a scientific understanding
00:11:24 you know in the meantime they've got to kind of you know the trains got to run and they got miles to feed and they got
00:11:28 things to do and there's nothing wrong with all that i would call that though just
00:11:33 engineering and i want to distinguish that between an engineering field like electoral internet chemical injury that
00:11:37 originally that originally emerged that had real principles and you really knew what you're doing and you
00:11:41 had a little scientific understanding maybe not even complete so it became more predictable and it was
00:11:47 really gave value to human life because it was understood and and so we have to we don't want to
00:11:53 muddle too much these waters of you know what we're able to do versus what we really can do in a way that's
00:11:57 going to impress the next so i don't i don't need to be wowed but i i think that someone comes along in 20 years
00:12:05 a younger person who's absorbed all the  the technology and for them to be wowed i think they have to be more deeply
00:12:10 impressed a young kulmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big
00:12:15 companies the demos but do you think the breakthroughs from kolmogorov would be and give this question a chance
00:12:20 do you think they'll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think it's possible to have fundamental
00:12:28 breakthroughs in engineering meaning you know i would say some of the things that elon musk is working with spacex
00:12:35 and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering of manufacturing of
00:12:41 of saying here's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale
00:12:46 yeah so so there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs i just don't like that terminology i'm a scientist and i work
00:12:50 on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually say wow something happened but it's i
00:12:56 don't like that language very much also i don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones
00:13:02 i tend to be more of a theoretician and i think there's lots to do in that arena right now and so i wouldn't
00:13:08 point to the komo gurus i might point to the edisons of the era and maybe musk is a bit more like that
00:13:14 but you know musk god bless him also we'll say things about ai that he knows very little about
00:13:19 and and he doesn't know what he's he he is you know leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn't know
00:13:23 anything about trying to program a computer to understand natural language to be
00:13:27 involved in a dialogue we're having right now that can happen in our lifetime you could fake it
00:13:33 you can mimic sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them with the deep understanding of language
00:13:38 now it's not going to happen and so from that you know i hope you can perceive that the deeper yet deeper kind of aspects
00:13:44 and intelligence are not going to happen now will there be breakthroughs you know i think that google
00:13:48 was a breakthrough i think amazon's a breakthrough you know i think uber is a breakthrough you know that
00:13:53 bring value to human beings at scale in new brand new ways based on data flows and and so on
00:13:58 a lot of these things are slightly broken because there's not a kind of a engineering field that takes economic
00:14:04 value in context of data and and at you know planetary scale and and worries about
00:14:09 all the externalities the privacy you know we don't have that field so we don't think these things through very well
00:14:14 but i see that is emerging and that will be cons that will you know looking back from 100 years that will be constituted
00:14:19 a breakthrough in this era just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the
00:14:23 last century and chemical injury was a breakthrough so the scale the markets that you talk about and we'll get to
00:14:30 will be seen as sort of breakthrough and we're in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we'll get to
00:14:36 that but it's just taking a quick step back can you give  we kind of threw off the historian hat
00:14:45 i mean you briefly said that  in the history of ai kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering
00:14:50 but i keep saying machine learning you keep want to say ai just to let you know i don't you know i
00:14:54 i'd resist that i don't think this is about ai really was john mccarthy as almost a philosopher saying wouldn't
00:15:02 it be cool if we could put thought in a computer if we could mimic the human capability to think or
00:15:08 put intelligence in in some sense into a computer that's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more
00:15:13 than philosophy he wanted to actually write down logical formula and algorithms that would do that
00:15:19 and that is a perfectly valid reasonable thing to do that's not what's happening in this era
00:15:24 right so so the reason i keep saying ai actually and i'd love to hear what you think about it machine learning has 
00:15:32 has a very particular set of methods and tools maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't no it does it's very very open
00:15:39 it does optimization it does sampling it does so systems that learn is what machine learning is systems that learn and make decisions
00:15:46 and make decisions so what is pattern recognition and from you know finding patterns it's all about making
00:15:51 decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops so something like symbolic ai expert
00:15:56 systems reading systems knowledge based representation all of those kinds of things search does that neighbor fit into what you think of as
00:16:04 machine learning so i don't even like the word but you know i think that with the field you're
00:16:09 talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities
00:16:14 yes right and there are principles for that at that scale you don't have to say the principles are
00:16:18 for a single entity that's making decisions a single agent or a single human it really immediately goes to the
00:16:23 network of decisions is a good award for that or no no there's no good words for any of this that's kind of part of the problem
00:16:28 so we can continue the conversation use ai for all that i just want to kind of raise our flag here that this is not about
00:16:37 we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence we don't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the
00:16:40 level of humans we don't have a clue we're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue
00:16:46 eventually it may emerge they'll make i don't know if there'll be breakthroughs but eventually we'll start to get
00:16:50 glimmers of that it's not what's happening right now though okay we're taking data we're trying to
00:16:54 make good decisions based on that we're trying to scale we're trying to do it economically viably we're trying to
00:16:57 build markets we're trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent it
00:17:05 will look computers were so dumb before they will seem more intelligent we will use that buzz word of
00:17:10 intelligence so we can use it in that sense but you know so machine learning you can
00:17:15 scope it narrowly is just learning from data and pattern recognition but whatever i when i talk about these
00:17:21 topics i maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix it really is important that the
00:17:26 decisions are as part of it it's consequential decisions in the real world are i have a medical operation am i
00:17:32 going to drive down the street you know things that where their scarcity things that
00:17:37 impact other human beings or other you know the environment and so on how do i do that based on data how do i
00:17:42 do that adaptively how i use computers to help those kind of things go forward whatever you want to call that
00:17:46 so let's call it ai let's agree to call it ai but it's let's let's not say that what the goal
00:17:51 of that is is intelligence the goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale
00:17:57 we've never seen before so reclaiming the word ai from the dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the
00:18:01 dream of humanity i don't want to reclaim it i want a new word i think it was a bad choice i mean i i you know i
00:18:06 if you read one of my little things the history was basically that  mccarthy needed a new name because
00:18:12 cybernetics already existed and he didn't like you know no one really liked norbert wiener you know ravina
00:18:17 was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did
00:18:22 you look at the language of cybernetics it was everything we're talking about it was control theory and single processing
00:18:27 and some notions of intelligence and close feedback loops and data it was all there it's just not a word
00:18:32 that lived on partly because of maybe the personalities but mccarthy needed a new word to say
00:18:37 i'm different from you i'm not part of your your show i got my own invented this word um
00:18:44 and again as a kind of a thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it
00:18:48  it was a great choice but thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline it was a
00:18:53 terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand we understand artificial perhaps but we
00:18:59 don't understand intelligence it's a small tangent because you're one of the great personalities of machine
00:19:04 learning whatever the heck you call the field the do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental
00:19:11 principles and theories and research that's outside of personality both and i wouldn't say there should be
00:19:18 one kind of personality i have mine and i have my preferences and i have a kind of network around me
00:19:24 that feeds me and and some of them agree with me and some disagree but all kinds of personalities are needed um
00:19:29 right now i think the personality that's a little too exuberant a little bit too ready to promise the moon
00:19:35 is a little bit too much in ascendance and i do i do think that that's there's some good
00:19:39 to that it certainly attracts lots of young people to our field but a lot of those people come in with
00:19:43 strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something you know
00:19:49 to do and so i think there's just got to be some multiple voices and there's i didn't i
00:19:53 wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice so  as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities
00:20:03 what would you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with yon lacoon
00:20:09 so john's an old friend and i just say that i i don't think we disagree about very much really
00:20:15 he and i both kind of have a let's build that kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and
00:20:20  kind of concrete we both speak french and we speak french more together and we have we have
00:20:25 a lot a lot in common and so you know if one wanted to highlight a
00:20:30 a disagreement it's not really a fundamental one i think it's just kind of where we're emphasizing jan has
00:20:39  emphasized pattern recognition and  has emphasized prediction all right so you know and it's interesting to try
00:20:45 to take that as far as you can if you could do perfect prediction what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment
00:20:52 and i think that's way too limited we cannot do perfect prediction we will never have the data
00:20:58 sets allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do what question you're going to ask next i have no clue i will
00:21:02 never know such things moreover most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of
00:21:09 situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very very novel in various ways and
00:21:15 in that moment we want to think through what we want and also there's going to be market forces acting on us
00:21:20 i'd like to go down that street but now it's full because there's a crane in the street i gotta i gotta think about that
00:21:24 i gotta think about what i might really want here and i gotta sort of think about how
00:21:28 much it cost me to do this action versus this action i got to think about the risks involved
00:21:33 you know a lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don't do any risk
00:21:38 evaluations they have no error bars right i got to think about other people's decisions around me i got to
00:21:43 think about a collection of my decisions even just thinking about like a medical treatment you know i'm not going to take
00:21:49 the prediction of a neural net about my health about something consequential am i about to have a heart attack because some
00:21:54 number is over 0.7 even if you had all the data in the world never been collected about heart attacks
00:22:01 better than any doctor ever had i'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack
00:22:04 i'm going to want to ask what if questions around that i'm going to want to look at some us or other possible
00:22:09 data i didn't have causal things i'm going to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we
00:22:15 didn't think about we gathered the data you know it i could go on and on i hope you can see and i don't i think that if
00:22:20 you say predictions everything that that you're missing all of this stuff and so prediction plus decision making
00:22:26 is everything but both of them are equally important and so the field has emphasized
00:22:31 prediction yan rightly so has seen how powerful that is but at the cost of people not being
00:22:36 aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road where human lives are at stake where risks are being
00:22:42 taken where you got to gather more data you got to think about the arab bars you got to think about the consequences of
00:22:46 your decisions on others you about the economy around your decisions blah blah blah i'm not the only one working on those
00:22:52 but we're a smaller tribe and right now we're not the the one that people talk about the
00:22:56 most but you know if you go out in the real world in industry you know
00:23:01 at amazon i'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing you know the
00:23:04 pattern recognition it's important and the words of pattern recognition and prediction i think the
00:23:09 distinction there not to linger on words but the distinction there is more a constrained
00:23:14 sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions
00:23:21 in the real world under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world and just the whole of it the whole mess
00:23:27 of it that actually touches human beings and scale like you said market forces that's the that's the distinction yeah
00:23:32 it helps add those that perspective that broader perspective you're right i totally agree  on the
00:23:36 other hand if you're a real prediction person of course you want it to be in the real world you want to predict real
00:23:40 world events i'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets  that it has to be in the context of you know
00:23:47  strategic things that someone's doing data they might gather things they could have gathered the
00:23:51 reasoning process around data it's not just taking data and making predictions based on the data
00:23:55 so one of the the things that you're working on i'm sure there's others working on it
00:24:02 it talked about especially in the clarity that you talk about it and i think it's both the most exciting
00:24:07 and the most concerning area of ai in terms of decision making so you've talked about ai systems that
00:24:14 help make decisions that scale in a distributed way millions billions decisions it's sort of markets of decisions can
00:24:21 you as a starting point sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you're thinking about these kinds
00:24:27 of systems  yeah so first of all you're absolutely getting into some territory which
00:24:32 i will be beyond my expertise and and there are lots of things that are going to be very non-obvious to think about
00:24:36 just like just again i like to think about history a little bit but think about put
00:24:41 yourself back in the 60s there was kind of a banking system that wasn't computerized really there was there was
00:24:46 database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do i actually not just move data around but
00:24:49 actual money and have it be you know valid and have transactions that atms happen that are
00:24:57 actually you know all valid and so on so forth so that's the kind of issues you get into when you start to
00:25:01 get serious about sort of things like this i like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think
00:25:09  something simpler which is a music market and  because there is the first door there is no music market
00:25:16 in the world right now or in the con in our country for sure  there are  something called things
00:25:21 called record companies and they make money  and they prop up a few um
00:25:27 really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money but
00:25:32 there's a long tale of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to
00:25:37 by more people than the famous people they are not in a market they cannot have a career they do not make money
00:25:45 the creators the creators the creators the so-called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are
00:25:50 right so there are people who make extremely good music especially in the hip-hop or latin
00:25:55 world these days  they do it on their laptop that's what they do on the weekend and they have another job
00:26:01 during the week and they put it up on soundcloud or other sites eventually it gets streamed it down gets
00:26:06 turned into bits it's not economically valuable the information is lost it gets put up there people stream it
00:26:13 you walk around in a big city you see people with headphones all you know especially young kids listen to music
00:26:16 all the time if you look at the data none of them very little the music they listen to is
00:26:21 the famous people's music and none of it's old music it's all the latest stuff but the people who made
00:26:26 that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this who will never make money
00:26:30 of course there will be a few counter examples the record companies incentivize to pick out a few and
00:26:35 highlight them long story short there's a missing market there there is not a
00:26:40 consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts the pipelines and spotifys of the
00:26:47 world that take this stuff and stream it along they make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things they're
00:26:52 making the money all right and then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that
00:26:58 you know they're they simulate a market anyway a real market would be if you're a creator of music that you
00:27:04 actually are somebody who's good enough that people want to listen to you you should have the data available to
00:27:09 you there should be a dashboard showing a map of the united states so in last week here's all the places your
00:27:13 songs were listened to it should be transparent vettable so that if someone in down in
00:27:20 providence sees that you're being listened to ten thousand times in providence that they know
00:27:25 that's real data you know it's real data they will have you come give a show down there they will broadcast to the people
00:27:29 who've been listening to you that you're coming if you do this right you could you could you know go down there make twenty
00:27:34 thousand dollars you do that three times a year you start to have a career so in this sense ai
00:27:39 creates jobs it's not about taking away human jobs it's creating new jobs because it
00:27:43 creates a new market once you've created a market you've now connected up producers and consumers
00:27:47 you know the new person who's making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot hey i'll play your
00:27:51 daughter's wedding for ten thousand dollars you'll say eight thousand they'll say nine thousand
00:27:57 then you again you you can now get an income up to a hundred thousand dollars you're not going to be a millionaire
00:28:03 all right and and now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections even so much so
00:28:09 that a young kid wants to wear a t-shirt with their favorite musician's signature on
00:28:14 it right so if they listen to the music on the internet the internet should be able to
00:28:19 provide them with a button as they push and the merchandise arrives the next day we can do that right and now
00:28:24 why should we do that well because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy but more the person who made the music
00:28:29 will get the money there's no advertising needed right so you could create
00:28:35 markets between personal consumers take five percent cut your company will be perfectly  sound
00:28:40 it'll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness
00:28:46 now this seems like it was easy just create this dashboard kind of create some connections and all that but
00:28:50 you know if you think about uber or whatever you think about the challenges in the real world of doing things like
00:28:54 this and there are actually new principles going to be needed you're trying to create a new kind of
00:28:58 two-way market at a different scale that's ever been done before there's going to be
00:29:04 you know unwanted aspects of the market there'll be bad people they'll be you know the data will get used in the
00:29:10 wrong ways you know it'll fail in some ways it won't deliver value you have to think that through just like anyone who
00:29:15 like ran a big auction or you know ran a big matching service in economics will think these things through
00:29:20 and so that maybe doesn't get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create markets but it starts
00:29:23 for at least for me solidify my thoughts and allow me to move forward in my own thinking
00:29:30 yeah so i talked to how to research at spotify actually i think their long-term goal they've
00:29:34 said is to  have at least 1 million creators make a make a comfortable living putting on spotify
00:29:45 so in and i think you articulate a really nice vision of  the world and the digital and the
00:29:53 cyber space of markets what what do you think companies like spotify or youtube or netflix
00:30:02 can do to create such markets is it an ai problem is it an interface problem so interface design
00:30:11 is it  some other kind of it was an economics problem who should they hire to solve these
00:30:16 problems well part of it's not just top down so the silicon valley has its attitude that they know how to do it they will
00:30:21 create the system just like google did with the search box that will be so good that they'll just everyone will adopt that
00:30:28 right it's not it's it's everything you said but really i think missing the kind of culture
00:30:32 all right so it's literally that 16 year old who's able to create the songs you don't create that as a silicon
00:30:37 valley entity you don't hire them per se right you have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted
00:30:44 and that they belong right so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this
00:30:49 you know netflix to their credit wanted some of that sort of credibility they created shows you know content they call it
00:30:54 content it's such a terrible word but it's called it's culture right and so with movies you can kind of
00:31:00 go give a large sum of money to somebody graduate from the usc film school it's a whole thing of its own but it's
00:31:06 kind of like rich white people's thing to do you know and you know american culture
00:31:11 has not been so much about rich white people it's been about all the immigrants all the africans who came and brought
00:31:18 that culture and those those rhythms and and that that to to this world and created this
00:31:22 whole new thing you know american culture and and so companies can't artificially create that they
00:31:28 can't just say hey we're here we're going to buy it up you got a partner right and um
00:31:34 so but anyway you know not to integrate these companies are all trying and they should and they
00:31:38 they are i'm sure they're asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort but it is
00:31:42 it is partly a respect the culture as you were as a technology person you got to blend your technology with cultural
00:31:49 with cultural  you know meaning how much of a role do you think the algorithm machine learning has in connecting the
00:31:56 consumer to the creator sort of  the recommender system aspect of this yeah it's a great question i
00:32:02 think pretty high recommend you know there's no magic in the algorithms but a good recommender system
00:32:08 is way better than a bad recommender system and  recommender systems was a billion dollar industry back even
00:32:15 you know 10 20 years ago and it continues to be extremely important going forward
00:32:18 what's your favorite recommender system just so we can put something well just historically i was one of the you know
00:32:22 when i first went to amazon and you know i first didn't like amazon because they put the book people out of
00:32:26 business or the library you know the local book sellers went out of business um
00:32:31 i've come to accept that they're you know there probably are more books being selled now and more people reading them than
00:32:38 ever before and then local books stores are coming back so you know that's how economics
00:32:43 sometimes work you go up and you go down but anyway when i finally started going there and i bought a few books i was
00:32:49 really pleased to see another few books being recommended to me that i never would have thought of
00:32:53 and i bought a bunch of them so they obviously had a good business model but i learned things
00:32:58 and i still to this day kind of browse using that service and i think lots of people get a lot
00:33:03 you know they're that that is a good aspect of a recommendation system i'm learning from
00:33:07 my peers in a in an indirect way and their algorithms are not meant to
00:33:13 have them impose what we what we learn it really is trying to find out what's in the data
00:33:17  it doesn't work so well for other kind of entities but that's just the complexity of human life like
00:33:21 shirts you know i'm not gonna get recommendations on shirts and  but that's that's that's interesting  if you try
00:33:27 to recommend  restaurants it's it's it's it's it's hard it's hard to do it at scale and and um
00:33:37 but  a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas matchings and so on is
00:33:43 really really still very open research-wise and there's new companies that could emerge that do that well
00:33:50 what what do you think is going to the messy difficult land of say politics and things like that that
00:33:56 youtube and twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems being able to suggest i think facebook
00:34:02 just launched facebook news so they're having recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting
00:34:12 you think this is this ai solvable again whatever term want to use do you think it's a solvable problem for machines or
00:34:17 is it a deeply human problem that's unsolvable  so i don't even think about it that level i think that what's broken with
00:34:22 some of these companies it's all monetization by advertising they're not at least facebook let's i
00:34:29 want to critique them they didn't really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way
00:34:34 right no one wants to pay for anything and so they all you know starting with google and
00:34:38 facebook they went back to the playbook of you know the the television companies back in the day
00:34:42 no one wanted to pay for this signal they will pay for the tv box but not for the signal
00:34:47 at least back in the day and so advertising kind of filled that gap but advertising was new and interesting and
00:34:52 it somehow didn't take over our lives quite right fast forward google provides a service that people don't want to pay for
00:35:02 and so somewhat surprising in the 90s they made end up making huge amounts they cornered
00:35:05 the advertising market it didn't seem like that was going to happen at least to me
00:35:09 these little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting but that
00:35:14 companies had maybe no other choice the tv market was going away and billboards and so on
00:35:20 so they've they got it and i think that sadly that  google just has me it was doing so well with that and making
00:35:25 such right they didn't think much more about how wait a minute is there a producer consumer
00:35:29 relationship to be set up here not just  between us and the advertisers market to be created is there an actual
00:35:34 market between the producer and consumer they're the producers the person who created that video clip the person that
00:35:38 made that website the person who could make more such things the person who could adjust
00:35:43 it and as a function of demand the person on the other side who's asking for different kinds of things you
00:35:47 know so you see glimmers of that now there's influencers and there's kind of a little
00:35:52 glimmering of a market but it should have been done 20 years ago it should have been thought about it should have
00:35:55 been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem and then facebook inherited that and i
00:36:01 think they also didn't think very much about that so fast forward and now they are making
00:36:07 huge amounts of money off of advertising and the news thing and all these clicks is just is feeding the advertising it's
00:36:13 all connected up to the advertiser so you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows
00:36:17 to you facebook you're very much incentivized to do that and when you start to find
00:36:22 it's breaking people are telling you well we're getting into some troubles you try to
00:36:26 adjust it with your smart ai algorithms right and figure out what are bad clicks though maybe shouldn't be
00:36:30 click-through rate it should be something i find that pretty much hopeless it does get into all the complexity in life
00:36:38 and you can try to fix it you should but you could also fix the whole business model and the business model is that really
00:36:44 what are are there some human producers and consumers out there is there some economic value to be
00:36:48 liberated by connecting them directly is it such that it's so valuable that  people are willing to pay for it
00:36:54 all right and micro payments like smart micro but even have to be micro so i i like the example suppose i'm
00:37:00 going next week i'm going to india never been to india before right  i have a couple days in in mumbai
00:37:06 i have no idea what to do there right and i could go on the web right now and search it's going to be kind of hopeless
00:37:11 i'm not going to find you know i'll have lots of advertisers in my face right
00:37:16 what i really want to do is broadcast to the world that i am going to mumbai and have someone on the other side of a
00:37:22 market look at me and and there's a recommendation system there so i'm not looking at all possible
00:37:26 people coming to mumbai they're looking at the people who are relevant to them so someone my age group someone who kind of
00:37:32 knows me in some level i give up a little privacy by that but i'm happy because what i'm going to get back is
00:37:35 this person's going to make a little video for me or they're going to write a little
00:37:39 two-page paper on here's the cool things that you want to do and move by this week especially
00:37:44 right i'm going to look at that i'm not going to pay a micro payment i'm going to pay you know 100
00:37:48 or whatever for that it's real value it's like journalism as i'm not a subscription it's that i'm
00:37:54 gonna pay that person in that moment company's gonna take five percent of that and that person has now got it it's
00:37:59 a gig economy if you will but you know done for in you know thinking about a little bit
00:38:03 behind youtube there was actually people who could make more of those things if they were connected to a
00:38:06 market they would make more of those things independently you have to tell them what to do you don't have to incentivize them
00:38:11 any other way and so yeah these companies i don't think have thought long long and hard
00:38:16 about that so i do distinguish on you know facebook on the one side who just not thought about
00:38:20 these things at all i think  thinking that ai will fix everything  and amazon thinks about them all the
00:38:25 time because they were already out in the real world they were delivering packages people's doors they were they
00:38:29 were worried about a market they were worrying about sellers and you know they worry and
00:38:32 some things they do are great some things maybe not so great but you know they're in that business model and then
00:38:37 i'd say google sort of hover somewhere in between i don't i don't think for a long long
00:38:41 time they they got it i think they probably see that youtube is more pregnant with possibility than than than
00:38:47 they might have thought and that they're probably heading that direction but  you know silicon valley's been
00:38:53 dominated by the google facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is that's the core problem
00:39:00 right the fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that you're monetizing
00:39:04 with click-through rate and that is the core problem you got to remove that so advertisement if you're going to
00:39:10 linger on that i mean that's an interesting thesis i don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that
00:39:18 so you're right the thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have the only thing we'll ever have
00:39:24 so we have to fix we have to build algorithms that despite that business model you know find the better angels of our
00:39:33 nature and do good by society and by the individual but you think we can slowly you think first of all
00:39:40 there's a difference between should and could so you're saying we should slowly move away from the
00:39:46 advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator the the question i also have is can we
00:39:53 because the advertising model is so successful now in terms of just making a huge amount of money
00:39:59 and therefore being able to build a big company that provides has really smart people working that
00:40:04 create a good service do you think it's possible and just to clarify you think we should
00:40:08 move away well i think we should yeah but  we is you know me so society yeah will the companies um
00:40:15 i mean so first of all full disclosure i'm doing a day a week at amazon because i kind of want to learn more about how
00:40:19 they do things so you know i'm not speaking for amazon in any way but you know i did go there because i
00:40:24 actually believe they get a little bit of this are trying to create these markets and they don't really use advertising is
00:40:29 not a crucial part of it that's a good question so it has become not crucial but it's
00:40:34 become more and more present if you go to amazon website and you know without revealing too many
00:40:38 deep secrets about amazon i can tell you that you know a lot of people company question this
00:40:43 and there's a huge questioning going on you do not want a world where there's zero advertising that actually is a bad world
00:40:49 okay so here's a way to think about it you're a company that like amazon is trying to bring products to customers
00:40:56 all right and the customer at any given you want to buy a vacuum cleaner say you want to know what's available for me
00:41:00 and you know it's not gonna be that obvious you have to do a little bit of work at it
00:41:03 the recommendation system will sort of help all right but now suppose this other person over here has just made the
00:41:08 world you know they spent a huge amount of energy they had a great idea they made a great vacuum cleaner
00:41:12 they know they they really did it they nailed it it's an mit you know whiz kid that made a great new vacuum
00:41:16 cleaner all right it's not going to be in the recommendation system no one will know about it the algorithms
00:41:21 will not find it and ai will not fix that okay at all right how do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get
00:41:29 in front of people be sold well advertising and here what advertising is it's a signal
00:41:34 that you're you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it
00:41:39 and to me as a consumer i look at that signal i say well first of all i know these are not just cheap little ads
00:41:44 because we have now right now i know that you know these are super cheap you know pennies  if i see an ad where it's
00:41:50 actually i know the company is only doing a few of these and they're making you know
00:41:53 real money is kind of flowing and i see an ad i may pay more attention to it and i actually might want that
00:41:58 because i see hey that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner or maybe there's something good there so
00:42:03 i will look at it and and so that's part of the overall information flow in a good market
00:42:09  so advertising has a role but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone
00:42:14 because it just you know dominar by these tiny little things that add up to big money
00:42:18 for the company you know so i i think it will just i think it will change because the
00:42:22 societies just don't you know stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising
00:42:26 currently annoys people more than it provides information and i think that at google probably is
00:42:31 smart enough to figure out that this is a dead this is a bad model even though it's a hard huge amount of
00:42:35 money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it and slowly and i'm sure the ceo there will figure
00:42:40 it out but they need to do it and  they need to so if you reduce advertising not to zero
00:42:47 but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer consumer actual real value
00:42:52 being delivered so real money is being paid and they take a five percent cut that five percent could start to get big
00:42:57 enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the the kind of the poor kind of advertising and i think that a good
00:43:01 company will will do that we'll realize that and they're com you know facebook you know
00:43:08 again god bless them they they bring you know grandmother's  you know  they bring children's
00:43:14 pictures into grandmother's lives it's fantastic but they need to think of a new business model
00:43:20 and and they that's that's the core problem there until they start to connect producer consumer i think they
00:43:25 will just just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then
00:43:29 buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health the
00:43:35 health issues will not go away so i apologize that we kind of return to words i don't think the exact terms
00:43:41 matter but don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer
00:43:54 and creator producer is the best like the is what advertisement strives to do
00:44:03 right so that is the best advertisement is literally now facebook is listening to our
00:44:07 conversation and heard that you're going to india and we'll be able to actually start
00:44:12 automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer so like i apologize if it's just a matter of terms
00:44:19 but just to draw a distinction is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better
00:44:23 algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection almost address that's a good question so let's
00:44:27 component all that push first of all i i what we just talked about i was defending advertising
00:44:33 okay so i was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way
00:44:38 especially algorithmically it's a sign that someone spent money on it it's a sign they think it's valuable
00:44:42 and if i think that if other things someone else thinks it's valuable and if i trust other people i might be
00:44:48 willing to listen i don't trust that facebook though is who's an intermediary between this
00:44:55 i don't think they care about me okay i don't think they do and i find it creepy that they know i'm going to india
00:45:00 next week because of our conversation why do you think that can we so what can you just put your pr
00:45:06 hat on why do you think you find facebook  creepy and not trust them as
00:45:14 as do majority of the population so they're out of the silicon valley companies i saw like not approval rate but there's
00:45:20 there's ranking of how much people trust companies and facebook is in in the gutter in the gutter including people inside of
00:45:26 facebook so what  what do you attribute that to because when i come on you don't find it creepy
00:45:31 that right now we're talking i might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who i don't know
00:45:36 kind of comes up to me and says i hear you going to india i mean that's not even facebook that's just a
00:45:42 if i want transparency in human society i want to have if you know something about me there's actually some reason
00:45:46 you know something about me that's something that if i look at it later and audit it kind of i approve
00:45:53 you know something about me because you care in some way there's a caring relationship even or an economic one or something not
00:45:59 just that you're someone who could exploit it in ways i don't know about or care about or or i'm
00:46:04 troubled by or or whatever and we're in a world right now where that happens way too much
00:46:10 and that facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at
00:46:16 times i think most people do find that creepy it's not for them it's not it's not that it's facebook that's not
00:46:21 doing it because they care about them right in any real sense and they shouldn't they should not be a big
00:46:27 brother caring about us that is not the role of a company like that why not wait not the big brother part
00:46:32 but the sharing the trust thing i mean don't those companies just to linger because a lot of companies have a lot of
00:46:38 information about us i would argue that there's companies like microsoft that has more information
00:46:43 about us than facebook does and yet we trust microsoft more well microsoft is pivoting
00:46:49 microsoft you know under satya nadella has decided this is really important we don't want to do creepy things we
00:46:54 really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of that
00:46:59 we don't decide right and i'm just kind of adding that the health the health of a market
00:47:05 is that  when i connect to someone who produces a consumer it's not just a
00:47:09 random producer consumer it's people who see each other they don't like each other but they sense that if
00:47:13 they transact some happiness will go up on both sides if a company helps me to do that
00:47:21 and moments that i choose of my choosing then fine so and also think about the difference between you know
00:47:28 browsing versus buying right there are moments in my life i just want to buy you know a gadget or something i need
00:47:33 something for that moment i need some ammonia for my house or something because i got a problem
00:47:38 a spill i want to just go in i don't want to be advertised at that moment i don't want to be led
00:47:42 down very dire you know that's annoying i want to just go and have it extremely easy to do what i want um
00:47:50 other moments i might say no it's like today i'm going to the shopping mall i want to walk around and see things and
00:47:55 see people and be exposed to stuff so i want control over that though i don't want the company's algorithms to decide
00:47:59 for me right and i think that's the thing we it's a total loss of control if facebook
00:48:04 thinks they should take the control from us of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information when we don't what
00:48:08 information that is how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn't really want them
00:48:13 to know about us they're not i don't want them to be helping me in that way i don't want them
00:48:17 to be helping them but they decide well they have control over um what i want and when
00:48:25 i totally agree so facebook by the way i have this optimistic thing where i think facebook has the kind of
00:48:30 personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing so i i'm really optimistic
00:48:36 of what facebook could do  it's not what it's doing but what it could do so i don't see that i think that
00:48:41 optimism is misplaced because there's not a bit you have to have a business model behind these
00:48:45 things yes create a beautiful thing is really let's be let's be clear
00:48:50 it's about something that people would value and and i don't think they have that business model
00:48:54 and i don't think they they will suddenly discover it by what you know have a long hot shower i disagree i disagree
00:49:02 in terms of  you can discover a lot of amazing things in the shower so if i didn't say that i
00:49:07 said they won't come they won't they won't do it but in the shower i think a lot of other
00:49:11 people will discover it i think that this guy so i should also  full disclosure there's a company
00:49:16 called united masters which i'm on their board and they've created this music market yes they have a hundred thousand artists
00:49:21 now signed on and they've done things like gone to the nba and the nba the music you find behind me
00:49:26 the eclipse right now is their music right that's a company that had the right business model in mind from the get-go
00:49:33 right executed on that and and from day one there was value brought to so here you have a kid who made some
00:49:38 songs who suddenly their songs are on the nba website right that that's real economic value to people
00:49:46 and  so you know so you and i differ on the optimism of being able to sort of  change the direction of
00:49:53 the titanic right so i yeah i'm older than you so i think titanic's crash got it
00:50:03 but  so and just to elaborate because i totally agree with you and i just want to know how difficult you think this
00:50:07 problem is of so for example i i want to read some news and i would there's a lot of times in
00:50:15 the day where something makes me either smile or think in a way where i like consciously think this really gave me value
00:50:23 like i sometimes listen to  the daily podcast in the new york times way better than the new york times
00:50:28 themselves by the way for people listening that's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast
00:50:33 space it doesn't make sense to me but often i'll listen to it 20 minutes and i
00:50:39 i would be willing to pay for that like five dollars ten dollars for that experience absolutely
00:50:44 and how difficult that's kind of what you're getting at is that little transaction how difficult is it to create a
00:50:51 frictionless system like uber has for example for other things what's your intuition there  so i first of all
00:50:57 i pay little bits of money to you know to say there's something called courts that does financial things i like medium
00:51:02 as a site i don't pay there but i would you had a great post on medium i would have loved to pay you a dollar
00:51:09 and but i wouldn't want it i wouldn't have wanted it per se because um
00:51:15 there should be also sites where that's not actually the goal the goal is to actually have a broadcast channel
00:51:19 that i monetize in some other way if i chose to i mean i could now people know about it i could i'm not
00:51:24 doing it but that's fine with me there also the musicians who are making all this music
00:51:29 i don't think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them all right because because people
00:51:34 can copy the bits too easily and it's just not that somewhere the value is the value is that a connection was made
00:51:39 between real human beings then you can follow up on that right and create yet more value so no i
00:51:45 think there's a lot of open questions here hot open questions but also yeah i do want
00:51:49 good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me and but it's pretty hard right i don't like them to
00:51:54 recommend stuff just based on my browsing history i don't like that based on stuff they
00:51:59 know about me quote quote what's unknown about me is the most interesting so this is the this is the really
00:52:04 interesting question we may disagree maybe not i think that i love recommender systems
00:52:11 and i want to give them everything about me in a way that i trust yeah but you but you don't because so
00:52:17 for example this morning i clicked on i you know i was pretty sleepy this morning i
00:52:22 clicked on a story about the queen of england yes right i do not give a damn about the
00:52:27 queen of england i really do not but it was clickbait it kind of looked funny and i had to say what the heck are
00:52:32 they talking about i don't want to have my life you know heading that direction now
00:52:35 that's in my browsing history the system in any reasonable system we'll think about
00:52:41 history right but but you're saying all the trace all the digital exhaust or whatever that's been kind of the models
00:52:47 if you collect all this stuff you're gonna figure all of us out well if you're trying to figure out like kind
00:52:51 of one person like trump or something maybe you could figure him out but if you're trying to figure out you
00:52:55 know 500 million people you know no way no way do you think so no i do
00:53:00 i think so i think we are humans are just amazingly rich and complicated every one of us has our little quirks
00:53:04 everyone else has our little things that could intrigue us that we don't even know and will intrigue us
00:53:09 and there's no sign of it in our past but by god there it comes and you know you fall in love with it and i
00:53:14 don't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that okay well i want them to provide a forum a market
00:53:20 a place that i kind of go and by hook or by crook this happens you know i i'm walking down the street and i hear
00:53:26 some chilean music being played and i never knew i like chili music but wow so there is that side and i want them to
00:53:32 provide a limited but you know interesting place to go right and so don't try to use your ai to kind of
00:53:39 you know figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out you know no create huge spaces for human
00:53:46 beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it'll be a lot more transparency i
00:53:52 won't have people randomly anonymously putting comments up and especially based on stuff they know
00:53:58 about me facts that you know we are so broken right now if you're you know especially if you're a
00:54:02 celebrity but you know it's about anybody that  anonymous people are hurting lots and
00:54:06 lots of people right now and that's part of this thing that silicon valley is thinking
00:54:10 that you know just collect all this information and use it in a great way so no i i'm
00:54:14 i'm not i'm not a pessimism i'm very much an optimist by nature but i think that's just been the wrong path for the
00:54:19 whole technology to take be more limited create let humans rise up don't don't try to replace them that's
00:54:27 the ai mantra don't try to anticipate them don't try to predict them because
00:54:32 you're you're not good at you're not going to do those things you're going to make things worse
00:54:37 okay so right now just give this a chance  right now the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow
00:54:45 watching your every move so they're looking at traces of you they're not directly interacting with
00:54:51 you sort of the your close friends and family the way they know you is by having conversation
00:54:56 by actually having interactions back and forth do you think there's a place for recommender systems
00:55:02 sort of to step because you you just emphasize the value of human to human connection but yeah
00:55:06 just give it a chance ai human connection is there a role for an ass system to have conversations with you
00:55:13 in terms of to try to figure out what kind of music you like not by just watching what you're listening
00:55:18 but actually having a conversation natural language or otherwise yeah no i'm i'm so i'm not against it
00:55:22 i just want to push back against them maybe you're saying you have options for facebook so
00:55:27 there i think it's misplaced but but i think that this one pending facebook yeah now so good for you
00:55:34 go for it that's a hard spot to be yeah no good human interaction like on our daily
00:55:39 the context around me in my own home is something that i don't want some big company to know about at all but i would
00:55:42 be more than happy to have technology help me with it which kind of technology well you know
00:55:48 just alexa amazon well a good alexa's done right i think alex is a research platform right now more than
00:55:51 anything else but alexa done right you know could do things like i
00:55:56 i leave the water running in my garden and i say hey alex so the waters are in my garden
00:56:00 and even have alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home that she should be told about that
00:56:04 that's a little bit of a reasoning i call that ai and by any kind of stretch it's a little bit of reasoning and it
00:56:09 actually kind of makes my life a little easier and better and you know i don't i wouldn't call
00:56:13 this a wow moment but i kind of think that overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing
00:56:19 but not when you're lonely alexa knowing loneliness no no there i don't want to let you that
00:56:25 be feel intrusive and i and i don't want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out
00:56:30 i really want to have a lot of control and i want transparency and control and if the company can stand up and give me
00:56:36 that in the context of new technology i think they're good first of all be way more successful than our current generation
00:56:40 and like i said i was mentioning microsoft earlier i really think they're pivoting to kind of be the
00:56:45 trusted old uncle but you know i think that they get that this is the way to go that if you let people
00:56:50 find technology empowers them to have more control and have and have control not just over privacy but over this rich
00:56:55 set of interactions that that people gonna like that a lot more and that's that's the right
00:57:00 business model going forward what does control over privacy look like do you think you should be able to just view
00:57:05 all the data that no it's much more than that i mean first of all it should be an individual decision
00:57:09 some people don't want privacy they want their whole life out there other people's want it um
00:57:16 privacy is not a zero one it's not a legal thing it's not just about which data is available which is not
00:57:22 i like to recall to people that you know a couple hundred years ago everyone there was not really big cities everyone
00:57:28 lived down the countryside and villages and in villages everybody knew everything about you very you
00:57:33 didn't have any privacy is that bad are we better off now well you know arguably no because what
00:57:38 did you get for that loss of at least certain kinds of privacy well 
00:57:43 people helped each other if they because they know everything about you they know something's bad's happening they will
00:57:46 help you with that right and now you live in a big city no one knows their mouth you get no help
00:57:52 so  it kind of depends the answer i want certain people who i trust and there should be
00:57:57 relationships i should kind of manage all those but who knows what about me i should have
00:58:01 some agency there it shouldn't i shouldn't be a drift in a sea of technology where i have no idea
00:58:06 i don't want to go reading things and checking boxes so i don't know how to do this and i'm
00:58:12 not a privacy researcher per se i just i recognize the vast complexity of this it's not just technology it's not just
00:58:18 legal scholars meeting technologists there's got to be kind of whole layers around it and so i when i
00:58:23 allude to this emerging engineering field this is a big part of it like when electrical engineering come
00:58:29 came i'm not wasn't around in the time but you just didn't plug electricity you know into walls and
00:58:34 it all kind of worked you don't have to have like underwriter's laboratory that reassured
00:58:38 you that that plug's not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and
00:58:42 that and everything there'll be whole people who can install things there'll be people who can watch the installers
00:58:47 there'll be a whole layers you know an onion of these kind of things and for things as deeply
00:58:53 interesting as privacy which is his least essential electricity that that's gonna take decades to
00:58:58 kind of work out but it's gonna require a lot of new structures that we don't have right now so it's kind of hard to
00:59:02 talk about it and you're saying there's a lot of money to be made if you get it right so absolutely
00:59:07 a lot of money to be made and all these things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful parts
00:59:14 of their lives  so yeah so yeah the dialect sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists
00:59:20 to the no technology is good kind of and that's you know in our public discourse you know in newspapers you see too much
00:59:25 of this kind of thing and and the sober discussions in the middle which are the challenging ones to
00:59:30 have are where we need to be having our conversations and you know there's not actually there's not many forum forum for those
00:59:37 you know there's that's that's kind of what i would look for maybe i could go and i could read a comment section of
00:59:42 something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth you don't see much of this right
00:59:46 which is why actually there's a resurgence of podcasts out of all because good people
00:59:51 are really hungry for conversation but their technology is not helping much so comment sections of anything
00:59:58 including youtube yeah is not hurting i'm not hurting yeah and you think technically speaking it's possible
01:00:08 to help i don't know the answers but it's it's a it's a less anonymity a little more locality um
01:00:15 you know worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you start
01:00:19 having a discussion you know not only is that people not gonna hurt you but it's not gonna be a total waste
01:00:22 your time because there's a lot of wasting of time that you know a lot of us i i pulled out
01:00:26 of facebook early on because it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value and
01:00:32 so yeah worlds that are somehow you enter in you know what you're getting and it's kind of
01:00:37 appeals to you might new things might happen but you kind of have some some trust in that world and there's some
01:00:44 deep interesting complex psychological aspects around anonymity  how that changes human behavior
01:00:49 indeed quite dark and quite dark yeah i think a lot of us are especially
01:00:54 those of us who really love the advent of technology i loved social networks when it came out i was just
01:00:59 i didn't see any negatives there at all but then i started  seeing comment sections i think it
01:01:04 was maybe you know cnn or something and i started going wow this this darkness i just did not know
01:01:10 about and and our technology is now amplifying it so sorry for the big philosophical
01:01:15 question but on that topic do you think human beings because you've also out of all things had
01:01:20 a foot in psychology too the do you think human beings are fundamentally good like
01:01:27 all of us have good intent that could be mined or is it depending on context and environment everybody could be evil thought my
01:01:35 answer is fundamentally good but fundamentally limited all of us have very you know blinkers on
01:01:43 we don't see the other person's pain that easily we don't see the other person's point of view that easily
01:01:48 we're very much in our own head in our own world and on my good days i think that
01:01:53 technology could open us up to you know more perspectives and more less blinkered and more understanding
01:01:58 you know a lot of wars in human history happen because of just ignorance they didn't they they thought the other
01:02:02 person was doing this well other person wasn't doing this and we have huge amounts of that
01:02:06 but in my lifetime i've not seen technology really help in that way yet and i do i do i do believe in that but
01:02:13 you know no i think fundamentally humans are good the people suffer people have grievances because you have
01:02:17 grudges and those things cause them to do things they probably wouldn't want they regret it often so no i
01:02:26 i i think it's a you know part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it
01:02:29 to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are well but do you think individual human life
01:02:38 or society could be modeled as an optimization problem not the way i think typically i mean
01:02:44 that's your time one of the most complex phenomena in the whole you know in all
01:02:49 ways individual human life for society as a whole both both i mean individual human life is
01:02:55 amazingly complex and so  you know optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that
01:02:59 talks about certain kind of things and  it just feels way too limited for the complexity
01:03:04 of such things what properties of optimization problems do you think so do you think most
01:03:10 interesting problems that could be solved through optimization  what kind of properties does that
01:03:16 surface have non-convexity convexity linearity all those kinds of things saddle points well so optimization's just one piece of
01:03:23 mathematics you know there's like you just even in our era we're aware that say sampling is coming up with examples of
01:03:30 something coming up with a description what's sampling well you they you can if you're a kind of a certain kind of
01:03:36 mathematician you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing but
01:03:40 optimization is roughly speaking trying to  find a point that a single point that is the
01:03:46 optimum of a criterion function of some kind and sampling is trying to from that same surface
01:03:53 treat that as a distribution or density and find prop points that have high density so um
01:04:00 i i want the entire distribution and the sampling paradigm and i want the you know the the single point that's the
01:04:05 best point in the par in the sample in the  optimization paradigm now if you were optimizing in the space of
01:04:10 probability measures the output of that could be a whole probability distribution so you can
01:04:14 start to make these things the same but in mathematics if you go too high up that kind of abstraction arc
01:04:19 you start to lose the  you know the ability to do the interesting theorems so you kind of
01:04:24 don't try to you don't try to overly over abstract so as a small tangent what kind of world view do you find more
01:04:32 appealing one that is deterministic or stochastic well that's easy i mean i'm a
01:04:39 statistician you know the world is highly stochastic wait i don't know what's going to happen in the next five minutes
01:04:43 right because you're going to ask what we're going to do massive uncertainty yeah you know
01:04:49 massive uncertainty and so the best i can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution
01:04:54 on things and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now so
01:05:02 how does the distributed at scale when look like so optimization can optimize sort of
01:05:13 it makes a lot more sense sort of  at least from from a robotics perspective for a single
01:05:17 robot for a single agent trying to optimize some objective function when you start to enter the real world
01:05:24 this game theoretic concept starts popping up and that how do you see optimization in this
01:05:31 because you've talked about markets in a scale what does that look like do you see this optimization do you see
01:05:36 it as sampling do you see like how how should you modify these all blend together and a system designer
01:05:41 thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these things so
01:05:47 you know a particle in a potential well is optimizing a function called lagrangian right the particle doesn't know that
01:05:53 there's no algorithm running that does that it just happens it's so it's a description mathematically of
01:05:57 something that helps us understand as analysts what's happening right and so the same will happen when
01:06:03 we talk about you know mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on so forth there'll
01:06:07 be certain principles that allow us to understand what's happening and whether or not the actual algorithms are being
01:06:11 used by any sense it's not clear now at some point i may have set up a
01:06:18 multi-agent or market kind of system and i'm now thinking about an individual agent in that system
01:06:23 and they're asked to do some tasks and they're incentivized in some way they get certain signals and they
01:06:28 they have some utility maybe what they will do at that point is they just won't know the answer they may have to
01:06:32 optimize to find an answer okay so an autism could be embedded inside of an overall market
01:06:38 you know and game theory is is very very broad it is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds
01:06:43 of problems but it's roughly speaking this is just the i don't know what you're going to do
01:06:49 so i kind of anticipate that a little bit and you anticipate what i'm anticipating and we kind of go back and forth in our
01:06:53 own minds we run kind of thought experiments you talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory
01:07:01 you know most optimization problems really hate saddle points maybe you can describe
01:07:05 what saddle points are but i've heard you kind of mentioned that there's a there's a branch of optimization
01:07:12 you could try to explicitly look for saddle points that's a good thing oh not optimization
01:07:17 that's just game theory that that's so  there's all kinds of different equilibria in game theory and some of
01:07:23 them are highly explanatory behavior they're not attempting to be algorithmic they're just trying to say if you happen
01:07:28 to be at this equilibrium you would see certain kind of behavior and we see that in real life that's what
01:07:32 an economist wants to do especially behavioral economist  in in continuous
01:07:40  differential game theory you're in continuous spaces a some of the simplest equilibria are
01:07:45 saddle points a nash equilibrium is a saddle point it's a special kind of salon point so
01:07:50 classically in game theory you were trying to find nash equilibria and algorithmic games here you're trying
01:07:56 to find algorithms that would find them and so you're trying to find saddle points i mean so that's literally what
01:07:59 you're trying to do but you know any economist knows that nash equilibria have their limitations
01:08:06 they are definitely not that explanatory in many situations they're not what you really want um
01:08:11 there's other kind of equilibria and there's names associated with these because they came from history with
01:08:16 certain people working on them but there will be new ones emerging so you know one example is a stackelberg equilibrium
01:08:23 so you know nash you and i are both playing this game against each other or for each other maybe it's cooperative
01:08:28 and we're both going to think it through and then we're going to decide and we're going to off you know do our thing
01:08:33 simultaneously you know in a stackelberg no i'm going to be the first mover i'm going to make a move
01:08:37 you're going to look at my move and then you're going to make yours now since i know you're going to look at my move
01:08:42 i anticipate what you're going to do and so i don't do something stupid but and but then i know that you were
01:08:47 also anticipating me so we're kind of going back and so far am i but there is then a first mover
01:08:52 thing and so there's a those are different equilibria all right and  so just mathematically
01:08:57 yeah these things have certain topologies certain shapes they're like southwest and algorithmically or
01:09:02 dynamically how do you move towards them how do you move away from things you know so some of these questions
01:09:08 have answers they've been studied others do not and especially if it becomes stochastic
01:09:13 especially if there's large numbers of decentralized things there's just  you know young people getting in this field
01:09:17 who kind of think it's all done because we have you know tensorflow well no these are all open problems and
01:09:23 they're really important and interesting and it's about strategic settings how do i collect data
01:09:27 suppose i don't know what you're going to do because i don't know you very well right well i got to kind of date about
01:09:32 you so maybe i want to push you in a part of the space where i don't know much about you so i can get data because
01:09:37 and then later i'll realize that you'll never you'll never go there because of the way the game is set up but you know
01:09:41 that's part of the overall you know data analysis context is that yeah even the game of poker is
01:09:46 fascinating space whenever there's any uncertainty your lack of information is it's a
01:09:52 super exciting space yeah  just  lingard optimization for a second so if we look at deep learning it's essentially
01:10:00 minimization of a complicated loss function so is there something insightful or hopeful that you see
01:10:07 in the kinds of function surface that loss functions that deep learning in in the real world
01:10:13 is trying to optimize over is there something interesting this is just the usual kind of problems
01:10:19 of optimization i think from an optimization point of view that surface first of all it's
01:10:24 pretty smooth and secondly if there's over if it's over parameterized there's kind of lots
01:10:31 of paths down to reasonable optima and so kind of the getting downhill to the to an optimum is viewed as not as
01:10:37 hard as you might have expected in high dimensions the fact that some optima tend to be really good ones and
01:10:44 others not so good and you tend to it's not sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation
01:10:51 yes but but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets i kind of suspect those will this
01:10:56 those will change in 10 years it will not be exactly those surfaces there'll be some others that are
01:11:00 and optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces are why other algorithms
01:11:07 layers of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity that's not that didn't come from
01:11:11 neuroscience per se i mean maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it they were thinking
01:11:16 about brains but  they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields you know  computer science control theory and
01:11:20 so on and that layers of these could transform things in certain ways and that
01:11:26 if it's smooth maybe you could  you know find parameter values you know it's a big is a is
01:11:32 a sort of big discovery that it's it's working it's able to work at this scale but um
01:11:38 i don't think that we're stuck with that and we're certainly not stuck with that because we're understanding the brain
01:11:43 so in terms of  on the algorithm size of gradient descent do you think we're stuck with gradient
01:11:49 descent this is  variants of it what variants do you find interesting or do you think there'll be something else invented
01:11:57 that  is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways so there's a co-design of the surface
01:12:03 and or the architecture and the algorithm so if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures we have now and
01:12:09 not just neural nets but you know phase retrieval architectures or materials completion architectures and
01:12:13 so on you know i think we've kind of come to a place where yeah
01:12:20 a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant and there are versions  they're you know that are a little better than
01:12:27 others they you know have more guarantees they're more robust and and so on and there's ongoing research to
01:12:31 kind of figure out which is the best downforce situation but i think that that'll start to
01:12:36 co-evolve that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture and so we shouldn't do it in this particular way
01:12:40 we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way
01:12:46 so  that that i can't really anticipate that co-evolution process but
01:12:52 you know gradients are amazing  mathematical objects they  have a lot of people who
01:12:59  start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what what they are and what they can do um
01:13:06 i mean to think about this way if  suppose that i tell you if you move along the x-axis you get 
01:13:11   you know you go uphill in some objective by you know three units whereas if you move on the y-axis you go
01:13:16 uphill by seven units right now i'm gonna only allow you to move a certain you know
01:13:21 unit distance all right what are you gonna do well the most not people will say
01:13:26 i'm gonna go along the y-axis i'm getting the biggest bang for my buck you know and my buck is only one unit so
01:13:32 i'm gonna put all of it in the y-axis right and  why should i even take any of my strength my step size and put any of it
01:13:39 in the x-axis because i'm getting less bang for my buck that seems like a completely you know
01:13:44 clear cl argument and it's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along
01:13:49 the y-axis it's to take a little bit of the x-axis  and that
01:13:54 to understand that you have to you have to know some math and so even a you know trivial so
01:13:59 so-called operator like grading is not trivial and so you know exploiting its properties is
01:14:04 still very very important now we know that just providing descent has got all kinds of problems it gets stuck in many
01:14:08 ways and it hadn't have you know good dimension dependence and so on so um
01:14:13 my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity how can we get dimension dependence how
01:14:18 can we do the theory of that and we've come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds of stochasticity
01:14:24 we have sufficient conditions generally we know if you if you do this we will give you a good guarantee
01:14:29 we don't have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general so stochasticity how much randomness to
01:14:36 inject into the into the walking along the gradient and what kind of randomness
01:14:41 why is randomness good in this process why is stochasticity good yeah so i give you simple answers but
01:14:48 in some sense again it's kind of amazing stochasticity just  you know particular features of a
01:14:55 surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically it won't hurt you
01:14:59 because  you know by chance there's very little chance that you would get hurt
01:15:06 and you know so here stochasticity you know is just kind of saves you from some of the particular
01:15:13 features of surfaces that you know and in fact if you think about you know surfaces that are discontinuous
01:15:19 in a first derivative like you know absolute value function you will go down and hit that point
01:15:24 where there's non-differentiability right and if you're running a deterministic argument at that point you
01:15:29 can really do something bad right whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely that's going to happen
01:15:33 you're going to you're going to hit that point so you know it's again not trivially analyzed but um
01:15:40 especially in higher dimensions also stochasticity our intuition isn't very good about it but it has
01:15:44 properties that kind of are very appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons
01:15:50 so it's it's all part of the mathematics to kind of that's what's fun to work in the field is that you get to
01:15:53 try to understand this mathematics and but long story short you know partly
01:16:00 empirically it was discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed i'd say that but
01:16:07 i don't see that we're getting clearly out of that  what's the most beautiful mysterious a
01:16:13 profound idea to you in optimization i don't know the most but let me just say that  you know
01:16:20 nestorov's work on nest drive acceleration to me is  pretty pretty surprising and
01:16:25 pretty deep can you elaborate well install acceleration is just that um
01:16:31 i suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around into space for the reasons i've alluded to there there
01:16:37 are nice directions to move and suppose that i tell you that you're only allowed to use gradients
01:16:41 you're not going to be allowed to you'll see this local person it can only sense kind of a change in the surface
01:16:48 but i'm going to give you kind of a computer that's able to store all your previous gradients and so you start to learn
01:16:54 some something about the the surface and i'm going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of
01:16:59 like a linear span of all the gradients so you can't kind of just move in some arbitrary direction right
01:17:03 so now we have a well-defined mathematical complexity model there's a certain classes of algorithms that can
01:17:09 do that and others that can't and we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces how fast can you get down to
01:17:13 the optimum so there's an answers to these so for a you know a smooth
01:17:19 convex function there's an answer which is one over the number of steps squared you will be within a ball of that size
01:17:28 after after k steps gradient descent in particular has a slower rate it's one over k
01:17:36 okay so you could ask is gradient is said actually even though we know it's a good algorithm is it the best algorithm
01:17:41 in the sense of the answer is no well well not clear yet because what one of our case score is a lower bound
01:17:48 that's that's probably the best you can do what gradient is one over k but is there something better
01:17:55 and so i think as a surprise to most though nest drove discovered a new algorithm that is got two pieces to it it uses two gradients
01:18:04 and  puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way and  the thing doesn't even move
01:18:09 downhill all the time it sometimes goes back uphill and if you're a physicist that kind of
01:18:13 makes some sense you're building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition but that that intuition is not enough to
01:18:20 understand kind of how to do it and why it works but it does it achieves one over k squared
01:18:26 and  it has a mathematical structure and it's still kind of to this day a lot of us are writing
01:18:30 papers and trying to explore that and understand it so there are lots of cool ideas in
01:18:35 optimization but just kind of using gradients i think is number one that goes back you know
01:18:41 150 years and then nest drive i think has made a major contribution with this idea so like you said gradients
01:18:45 themselves are in some sense mysterious yeah they're not 
01:18:50 they're not as trivial as they're not as trivial coordinate descent is more of a trivial one you just pick
01:18:55 one of the coordinates that's how we think that's our human mind that's our human minds think and gradients are not
01:19:01 that easy for our human mind to grapple with an absurd question but  what is statistics so the here it's a little bit it's
01:19:11 somewhere between math and science and technology it's somewhere in that convex hole so it's a
01:19:16 set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed
01:19:20 and also principles allow you make decisions where you can have some reason to believe you're not
01:19:25 going to make errors so all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error what do you mean by
01:19:31 you know the probabilities and but you know you start after you start making some of those assumptions you're
01:19:35 led to  conclusions that yes i can guarantee that you know
01:19:40 you know if you do this in this way your probability of making error will be small your probability of continuing to not
01:19:47 make errors over time will be small and probability you found something that's real will be
01:19:53 small  will be high so decision making is a big part of the big part yeah so  the original
01:19:58 so statistics  you know short history was that you know it's kind of goes back as a formal discipline you know 250
01:20:05 years or so it was called inverse probability because around that era probability was developed sort of
01:20:12 especially to explain gambling situations of course and interesting so you would say well given the state of
01:20:18 nature is this there's a certain roulette board that has a certain mechanism in it
01:20:22  what kind of outcomes do i expect to see  and especially if i do things long long
01:20:27 amounts of time what outcomes i see and the physicists start to pay attention to this and then people say well given let's
01:20:34 turn the problem around what if i saw certain outcomes could i infer what the underlying mechanism was
01:20:38 that's an inverse problem and in fact for quite a while statistics was called inverse probability
01:20:44 that was the name of the field and i believe that  it was laplace  who was working in napoleon's government who was
01:20:51 trying to who needed to do a census of france learn about the people there so he went and gathered data
01:20:58 and he analyzed that data to determine policy and  said let's call this field that does
01:21:04 this kind of thing statistics because the the word state is in there in french that's eta
01:21:11 but you know it's the study of data for the state so anyway that caught on and it's
01:21:18 been called statistics ever since but  but by the time it got formalized it was sort of in the 30s
01:21:24 and  around that time there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby people in that era didn't think
01:21:30 of themselves as either computer science or statistics or controlled or econ they were all
01:21:34 they were all the above and so you know von neumann is developing game theory but also
01:21:39 thinking of that as decision theory wall is an econometrician developing decision theory and then you
01:21:44 know turning that into statistics and so it's all about here's a here's not just data and you analyze it here's
01:21:50 a loss function here's what you care about here's the question you're trying to ask
01:21:55 here is a probability model and here's the risk you will face if you make certain decisions and
01:22:02 to this day in most advanced statistical curricula you teach decision theory is the starting point
01:22:06 and then it branches out into the two branches of bazin or frequentist but that's it's all about decisions in statistics
01:22:16 what is the most beautiful mysterious maybe surprising idea that you've come across
01:22:25  yeah good question i mean there's a bunch of surprising ones there's something that's way too
01:22:29 technical for this thing but something called james stein estimation which is kind of surprising
01:22:35 and really takes time to wrap your head around can you try to maybe i think i don't even want to try let
01:22:41 me just say a colleague at steve steven stickler at university of chicago wrote a really beautiful
01:22:46 paper on james stein estimation which helps to its views of paradox it kind of defeats the mind's attempts to
01:22:51 understand it but you can and steve has a nice perspective on that
01:22:57 there  so one of the troubles with statistics is that it's like in physics that are in quantum physics you have
01:23:02 multiple interpretations there's a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time but it
01:23:09 still kind of haunts you that you don't really you know quite understand the relationship the electrons away when
01:23:14 electrons a particle well well the same thing happens here there's bayesian ways of thinking and
01:23:20 frequentist and they are different they they all they sometimes become sort of the same in practice
01:23:24 but they are physically different and then in some practice they are not the same at all they give you rather
01:23:29 different answers and so it is very much like wave and particle duality and that is something
01:23:35 you have to kind of get used to in the field can you define beijing and frequencies yeah in decision theory you can make
01:23:40 i have a like i have a video that people could see it's called are you a bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help
01:23:46 try to to make it really clear it comes from decision theory so you know decision theory
01:23:51  you're talking about loss functions which are a function of data x and parameter theta it's a
01:23:57 function of two arguments okay neither one of those arguments is known you don't know the data a priori
01:24:03 it's random and the parameter is unknown all right so you have this function of two things you don't know and you're
01:24:07 trying to say i want that function to be small i want small loss right well what are you gonna do so
01:24:15 you sort of say well i'm gonna average over these quantities or maximize over them or something so
01:24:19 that you know i turn that uncertainty into something certain so you could look at the first argument
01:24:25 an average over it or you could look at the second argument average over it that's bayesian frequencies so
01:24:29 the frequencies says i'm going to look at the x the data and i'm going to take that as random and
01:24:34 i'm going to average over the distribution so i take the expectation loss under x theta is held fixed
01:24:42 all right that's called the risk and so it's looking at other all the data sets you could get
01:24:47 all right and say how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets
01:24:52 that's called a frequency guarantee all right so i think it is very appropriate when like you're building a piece of
01:24:56 software and you're shipping it out there and people are using all kinds of data sets
01:25:00 you want to have a stamp a guarantee on it that as people run it on many many data sets that you never even thought
01:25:04 about that 95 of the time it will do the right thing perfectly reasonable
01:25:11 the bayesian perspective says well no i'm going to look at the other argument of the loss function the theta part
01:25:16 okay that's unknown and i'm uncertain about it so i could have my own personal probability for what it
01:25:21 is you know how many tall people are there out there i'm trying to infer the average height of the population well i
01:25:27 have an idea roughly what the height is so i'm going to average over the the theta so now that loss function
01:25:37 has only now again one argument's gone now it's a function of x and that's what a bayesian does is they say well
01:25:42 let's just focus on the particular x we got the data set we got we condition on that conditional on the x i say something
01:25:47 about my loss that's a bayesian approach to things and the bayesian
01:25:53 will argue that it's not relevant to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten
01:25:57 and average over them the frequentest approach it's really only the data set you got all right and
01:26:03 i do agree with that especially in situations where you're working with a scientist you can learn a
01:26:07 lot about the domain and you really only focus on certain kinds of data and you've gathered your
01:26:13 data and you make inferences i don't agree with it though that it you know in the sense that there are
01:26:18 needs for frequency guarantees you're writing software people are using it out there you want to say something so these
01:26:22 two things have to go out to fight each other a little bit but they have to blend so long story short there's a set of
01:26:27 ideas that are right in the middle they're called empirical bays and empirical base sort of starts with
01:26:33 the bayesian framework it's it's kind of arguably philosophically more
01:26:40 you know reasonable and kosher write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that
01:26:44 and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know because it's the real world then you don't
01:26:48 know everything so you're uncertain about certain quantities at that point ask is there a reasonable way to plug in
01:26:54 an estimate for those things okay and in some cases there's quite a reasonable thing to do
01:27:00 to plug in there's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in
01:27:03 and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it's really good
01:27:08 so my math are based on human expertise what's what are good they're both going in the bayesian framework allows you to put a
01:27:15 lot of human expertise in but the math kind of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you
01:27:19 at the end you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumptions this thing will work so perhaps you
01:27:24 asked question what's my favorite you know or what's the most surprising nice idea so
01:27:27 one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate which is you know you're making not
01:27:34 just one hypothesis test or making one decision you're making a whole bag of them and in that bag of decisions you look at
01:27:41 the ones where you made a discovery you announced that something interesting it happened all right that's gonna be some subset of
01:27:46 your big bag in the ones you made a discovery which subset of those are bad
01:27:53 there are false false discoveries you like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small
01:27:59 that's a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity it's it's a
01:28:04 different quantity those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequencies flavor they
01:28:11 say given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true here's what accuracy i would get
01:28:17 or given that the alternative is true here's what i would get so it's kind of going forward from the state of nature
01:28:23 to the data the bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature
01:28:27 and that's actually what false discovery rate is it says given you made a discovery okay that's condition on your data
01:28:34 what's the probability of the hypothesis it's going the other direction and so the classical frequency look at that so
01:28:40 i can't know that there's some priors needed in that and the empirical bayesian goes ahead
01:28:46 and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas and realizes at some point some of those things can actually
01:28:52 be estimated in a reasonable way oh and so it's kind of it's a beautiful set of ideas so i i this kind of line of
01:28:56 argument has come out it's not certainly mine but it it sort of came out from
01:29:03 robin's around 1960.  brad ephron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books and 
01:29:10 and the fdr is you know ben yamini in israel john storey did this bayesian interpretation
01:29:16 and so on so i've just absorbed these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think about
01:29:22 statistics let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy perhaps you said that
01:29:31  maybe you can elaborate but  you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a
01:29:38 word is as a very difficult question is that a useful question do you think we'll one day understand
01:29:43 the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means you know have good  benchmarks for
01:29:51 general intelligence that we put before our machines so i don't work on these topics so much
01:29:57 you're really asking a question for a psychologist really and i just studied some but i don't consider myself
01:30:04 at least an expert at this point you know a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence right and i think
01:30:09 many psychologists i know are fairly humble about this they they might try and understand how a
01:30:14 baby understands you know whether something's a solid or liquid or  whether something's hidden or not and um
01:30:22 maybe how you know a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words what's a verb what's a noun and also you know
01:30:28 slowly but surely trying to figure out things but human's ability to take a really complicated environment reason about it
01:30:36 abstract about it find the right abstractions communicate about it interact and so on is just you know really
01:30:45 staggeringly rich and complicated and so you know i think in all humidity we don't
01:30:51 think we're kind of aiming for that in the near future certainly psychologists doing experiments with babies in the lab
01:30:56 or with people talking is is has a much more limited aspiration and you know conor mcversky would look at
01:31:01 our reasoning patterns and they're they're not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning but
01:31:05 they're sort of saying here's some here's some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should you need to
01:31:10 think about it but also i as i emphasize and things some things i've been writing about um
01:31:14 you know ai the revolution hasn't happened yet yeah great blog post i've i've been
01:31:19 emphasizing that you know if you step back and look at  intelligent systems of any kind
01:31:24 whatever you mean by intelligence it's not just the humans or the animals or you know the plants or whatever you know
01:31:31 so a market that brings goods into a city you know food to restaurants or something every day
01:31:36  is a system it's a decentralized set of decisions looking at it from far enough away it's
01:31:40 just like a collection of neurons everyone every neuron is making its own little decisions presumably in some way and if
01:31:45 you step back enough every little part of an economic system is making us all of its decisions
01:31:50 and just like with the brain who knows what the individual neuron doesn't know what the overall goal is
01:31:55 right but something happens at some aggregate level same thing with the economy people eat in a city and it's robust it
01:32:03 works at all scales small villages to big cities it's been working for thousands of years
01:32:08  it works rain or shine so it's adaptive so all kind of you know those are adjeeves one tends to
01:32:15 apply to intelligent systems robust adaptive you know you don't need to keep adjusting it it's self self healing
01:32:21 whatever plus not perfect you know intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect
01:32:25 but i do not believe in this area that you cannot that you can say well our computers our humans are smart but
01:32:29 you know no markets are not more markets are so they are intelligent
01:32:36  now we humans didn't evolve to be markets we've been participating in them right but we are not ourselves a market per se
01:32:44 the neurons could be viewed as the market you can't there's economic you know neuroscience
01:32:48 kind of perspectives that's interesting to pursue all that the point though is is that if you were to study humans and
01:32:53 really be the world's best psychologist study for thousands of years and come up with the
01:32:57 theory of human intelligence you might have never discovered principles of markets you know spy
01:33:02 demand curves and you know matching and auctions and all that  those are real principles and
01:33:07 they lead to a form of intelligence that's not maybe human intelligence it's arguably
01:33:11 another kind of intelligence there probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us
01:33:15 are really thinking too much about right now so if you really and then all those are relevant to computer systems
01:33:21 in the future certainly the market one is relevant right now whereas understand human intelligence is
01:33:26 not so clear that it's relevant right now probably not so if you want general intelligence
01:33:32 whatever one means by that or you know understand the intelligence in a deep sense and all that it is definitely
01:33:37 has to be not just human intelligence it's got to be this broader thing and that's not a mystery markets are
01:33:42 intelligent so you know it's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we gotta move beyond and
01:33:46 tell who intelligence that sounds ridiculous yeah but it's not and in that blog post you define different kinds of like
01:33:53 intelligent infrastructure iii which i really like that's some of the concept you've just been
01:33:59 describing do you see ourselves if we see earth human civilization is a single organism
01:34:04 do you think the intelligence of that organism when you think from the perspective of markets and intelligence infrastructure is
01:34:12 increasing is it increasing linearly is it increasing exponentially what do you think the future of that
01:34:17 intelligence i don't know i don't tend to think i don't tend to answer questions like that
01:34:21 because you know that's science fiction well again because you said it's so far in the future
01:34:31 it's fun to ask and you'll probably you know like you said predicting the future is really
01:34:37 nearly impossible but say as an axiom one day we create a human level superhuman level
01:34:44 intelligent not the scale of markets but the scale of an individual what do you think is
01:34:51 is what do you think it would take to do that or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different
01:34:59 than the biological human beings that we see around us today is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or
01:35:05 is it just a stupid question it's not stupid question but it's science fiction science fiction and so
01:35:10 i'm totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time my own life
01:35:15 i loved there was this like brain in a vat kind of you know little thing that people were talking about when i was a
01:35:19 student i remember you know imagine that  you know between your brain and your body there's you
01:35:26 know there's a bunch of wires right and suppose that every one of them was replaced with a 
01:35:31  literal wire and then suppose that wire was turning actually a little wireless you know there's a receiver and sender
01:35:36 so the brain has got all the senders and receiver you know on all of its exiting 
01:35:43 you know axons and all the dendrites down the body have replaced with syndrome receivers now you
01:35:47 could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat right and then you could do things like
01:35:52 start killing off those centers of receivers one by one and after you've killed off all of them
01:35:57 where is that person you know they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved
01:36:00 on so those are science fiction things those are fun to think about it's just intriguing about where's what is thought
01:36:05 where is it and all that and i think every 18 year old it's to take philosophy classes and think about
01:36:10 these things and i think that everyone should think about what could happen in society
01:36:14 that's kind of bad and all that but i really don't think that's the right thing for most of us that are my age
01:36:19 group to be doing and thinking about i really think that we have so many more present you know first challenges and dangers and
01:36:29 real things to build and all that such that  you know  spending too much time on
01:36:33 science fiction at least in public fora like this i think is is not what we should be doing maybe over
01:36:38 beers in private that's right i'm well welcome welcome i'm not gonna broadcast where i have beers because
01:36:44 this is gonna go on facebook a lot of people showing up there but yeah i'll  i love facebook twitter amazon
01:36:53 youtube i have i'm optimistic and hopeful but  maybe maybe i don't have grounds for such optimism and hope
01:37:03 let me ask term you've mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the field
01:37:11 can you  give advice to people who undergraduates today what does it take to take
01:37:16 you know advice on their journey if they're interested in machine learning and ai in in
01:37:23 the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the kinds of things that you're exploring
01:37:27 what what what steps should they take on that journey well yeah first of all the door is open and second it's a journey i
01:37:33 like your language there  it is not that you're so brilliant and you have great brilliant ideas and
01:37:38 therefore that's that's just you know that's how you have success or that's how you enter into the field
01:37:44  it's that you apprentice yourself you you spend a lot of time you work on hard things you
01:37:51 try and pull back and you be as broad as you can you talk lots of people and it's like entering any kind of a
01:37:58 creative community there's years that are needed and  human connections are critical to
01:38:02 it so you know i think about you know being a musician or being an artist or something you don't just
01:38:08 you know immediately from day one you know you you're a genius and therefore you do it no you
01:38:15 you know practice really really hard on basics and you  be humble about where you are
01:38:21 and then and you realize you'll never be an expert on everything so you kind of pick and there's a lot of randomness and
01:38:26 a lot of kind of luck but luck just kind of picks out which branch of the tree go down but you'll go
01:38:33 down some branch so yeah it's it's a community so the graduate school is
01:38:38 i still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have in our in our world it's it's very much about
01:38:43 apprenticeship with an advisor it's very much about a group of people you belong to it's a four or five year process so it's
01:38:49 plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something you know more expertise and then start to have
01:38:54 your own creativity start to flower even surprise into your own self and it's a very cooperative endeavor it's i think
01:39:03 a lot of people  think of science as highly competitive and i think in some other fields it might be
01:39:07 more so here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine
01:39:12 and people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to
01:39:17  be clear that so i i feel i'm an expert on certain kind of things but i'm very much not expert on lots of
01:39:21 other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are i should know but it should in some sense i you know
01:39:28 you don't so i'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things
01:39:33 and  i think a lot of us feel that way about our field so it's very cooperative  i might add it's also very
01:39:38 international because it's so cooperative we see no barriers and  so that the nationalism that you
01:39:44 see especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of us
01:39:48 think about what we're doing here where this is a human endeavor and we we cooperate and
01:39:53 are very much trying to do it together for the you know the benefit of everybody so last question
01:40:00 where and how and why did you learn french and which language is more beautiful english or french
01:40:07 great question so first of all i think italian's actually more beautiful than french and english and i also speak
01:40:12 that so i'm i'm i'm married to an italian and i have kids and we speak italian
01:40:19 anyway though all kidding aside that every language allows you to express things a bit differently um
01:40:25 and it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things so in fact when i kids or you know teens or
01:40:32  college students ask me what they just study i say well do what your heart where your heart is certainly do a lot
01:40:38 of math math is good for everybody but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too
01:40:43 you know throughout your life you'll want to be a thinking person you'll want to have done that for me
01:40:50  yeah french i learned when i was i'd say a late teen i was living in the middle of the country
01:40:57 in kansas and  not much was going on in kansas with all due respect to kansas but  and so my parents happen to have some
01:41:03 french books on the shelf and just in my boredom i pulled them down and i found this is fun
01:41:08 and i kind of learned the language by reading and when i first heard it spoken i had no idea what was being spoken but i
01:41:13 realized i somehow knew it from some previous life and so i made the connection
01:41:19 but then you know i traveled and just i i love to go beyond my own barriers and 
01:41:24 my own comfort or whatever and i found myself in you know on trains in france next to
01:41:29 say older people who would you know live the whole life of their own and the ability to communicate with them was
01:41:34 was you know special and  ability to also see myself in other people's shoes and have empathy
01:41:41 and kind of work on that language as part of that so so after
01:41:47 that kind of experience and also embedding myself in french culture which is you know
01:41:51 quite quite amazing you know languages are rich not just because there's something inherently beautiful about it but it's
01:41:56 all the creativity that went into it so i learned a lot of songs read poems read books and then i was here actually at mit
01:42:03 where we're doing the podcast today and  young professor you know not yet married and 
01:42:11 you know not having a lot of friends in the area so i just didn't have i was getting kind of a bored person i
01:42:15 said i heard a lot of italians around there's happened to be a lot of italians at mit
01:42:20 behind professor for some reason and so i was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about i said well i
01:42:24 should learn this language too so i i did and then later met my spouse and  you know wow italian became a more
01:42:30 important part of my life but but i go to China  a lot these days i go to asia i go to europe and every time i
01:42:36 go i kind of  i'm amazed by the richness of human experience and the the
01:42:41 people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled kind of how i'm you know amazingly rich and i love
01:42:47 the diversity it's not just a buzzword to me it really means something i love the you know you know embed myself with
01:42:54 other people's experiences and  so yeah learning language is a big part of that i think i've said in some
01:42:58 interview at some point that if i had you know millions of dollars on the infinite time whatever what would you
01:43:03 really work on if you really wanted to do ai and for me that is natural language and really done right you know deep
01:43:08 understanding of language that's to me an amazingly interesting scientific challenge
01:43:15 and  when we're very far away one we're very far away but good natural language people are kind of really
01:43:19 invested then i think a lot of them see that's where the core of ai is that if you understand that you really help
01:43:24 human communication you understand something about the human mind the semantics that come out of the
01:43:28 human mind and i agree i think that will be such a long time so i didn't do that in my
01:43:33 career just because i kind of i was behind in the early days i didn't kind of know enough of that stuff i was
01:43:38 at mit i didn't learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind of spend a
01:43:43 whole career doing that but i admire that field and  and so in my little way by learning language
01:43:51 you know kind of that part of my brain has has been trained up jan was right you truly are the miles
01:43:57 davis and machine learning i don't think there's a better place than it was mike is a huge honor talking to

01:44:36 let me leave you with some words of wisdom from michael i jordan from his blog post titled artificial intelligence
01:44:44 the revolution hasn't happened yet calling for broadening the scope of the ai field we should embrace the fact that what we
01:44:51 are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering the term engineering is
01:44:57 often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones of cold effectless machinery and negative
01:45:05 connotations of loss of control by humans but an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be
01:45:12 in the current era we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new
01:45:19 a human-centric engineering discipline i'll resist giving this emerging discipline a name but if the acronym ai
01:45:26 continues to be used let's be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder let's broaden our scope tone down the hype
