00:00:01 the following is a conversation with commander david fravor who was a navy pilot for 18 years and
00:00:08 commander of the strike fighter squadron 41 also known as the black aces a squadron of 12 airplanes consisting of several
00:00:15 hundred people he's also famously one of the people who with his own eyes
00:00:23 saw and chased a ufo an identified flying object in 2004 that is referred to as the tic tac and
00:00:30 the incident more formally referred to as the uss nimitz ufo incident
00:00:37 his story corroborated by several other pilots from my perspective as a curious scientist and an open-minded human being
00:00:45 is the most credible sighting of a ufo in history at least that i'm aware of he's a humble
00:00:52 fascinating and fun human being to talk to i put out a call for questions on reddit and many other places and
00:00:58 tried to ask as many of the questions that people posted as i could and overall i really enjoyed this
00:01:04 conversation and i'm sure if the world wants us to and if there's more questions to be had

00:01:24 let me say that the world of ufos and uaps unidentified aerial phenomena and aliens in general
00:01:31 is foreign to me because of the high ratio of outlandish conspiracy theorists to actual hard evidence i'm a scientist
00:01:38 first and foremost but an open-minded one often looking and thinking outside the box
00:01:44 i'm often disheartened by the closed-mindedness of the scientific community and in equal part i'm disheartened by
00:01:52 the lack of rigor and basic scientific inquiry and study on the part of the conspiracy theorists
00:01:58 i believe there's a line somewhere between the two extremes that more inquisitive minds should walk
00:02:05 i think we humans know very little about our world what's up there among the stars and the
00:02:10 nature of reality and the nature of our very own minds the path to understanding can only be
00:02:17 walked humbly the very idea that there is a possibility that david witnessed a piece
00:02:22 of technology whether human made or alien made that moved in the way it did
00:02:29 should be inspiring to every scientist and engineer on this earth there may be propulsion and energy
00:02:34 systems yet to be discovered that once understood and mastered will put distant galaxies
00:02:41 within reach of us human beings paradigm shifts in science and leaps and understanding can only happen
00:02:47 i think if we open our eyes and allow ourselves to dream to think from first principles
00:02:53 and remove the constraints and innovation placed on us by the scientific conventions and assumptions of

00:03:44 now let me take a hard left turn and talk about fasting i fast often sometimes intermittent
00:03:50 fasting of 16 hours and then an eight hour eating period of two meals sometimes 24 hours
00:03:57 that's one dinner to the next i've been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hour fast that some people i look up to have
00:04:03 done people who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss and the different health benefits
00:04:09 it's a chance to meditate on the finiteness of life not eating somehow is a reminder that
00:04:14 we're immortal that every day is precious i certainly experienced this with the 24-hour fast
00:04:22 and i think it goes even deeper for the 48 72 and even week-long fasts anyway i always break my

00:06:22 movie castaway with tom hanks and the idea of spending time on an island alone with potentially no hope
00:06:29 the natural question is if i could what would i bring to this island the answer is complicated but let me
00:06:34 pick one thing the first thing that popped into my crazy mind which is the introduction to algorithms book
00:06:42 also called clrs for the first letters of the last name of its four authors i find algorithms beautiful like a
00:06:49 little toolbox for a simple world inside computers when the real world outside is an impossible chaotic mess

00:07:06 to get a discount and to support this podcast and now finally here's my conversation with david fraver you're a graduate of the
00:07:18 navy fighter weapons school yeah i am better known as top gun so yeah let me let me ask the most ridiculous question
00:07:26 how realistic is the movie top gun so it's funny we used to joke and a friend of mine who was a top cut instructor
00:07:32  said this there's two things in the in the original top gun that are true that are very realistic one there is a
00:07:39 place called top gun and number two is they do fly airplanes there other than that  you know i went
00:07:46 through in 97  class 497 and there's actually a log of every single person that's went
00:07:52 through kind of like seal training you know there's a list so people because there's a lot of posers
00:07:58 out there i was a navy seal no you weren't well i went to top gun you could actually go to top gun and matter of fact
00:08:03 just to get a top gun patch the real patch  you have to have gone there so a lot of the patches you see
00:08:11 running around are not real there's the real ones are controlled the people that make them  honor that
00:08:17 and when you go in they look up your name if you want to get one they look up your name you just tell them they go okay
00:08:21 here and i'll sell them to you if you are not on the list you ain't get no patch because it is
00:08:27 it's it's it's a pretty big deal to go through but it's for me  probably the best experiences of flying
00:08:35  because everyone there is extremely competent it's it's very very challenging but it's what we
00:08:41 all signed up to do so it's  it's just the entire group that is when you want to be that you
00:08:48 know that level  you know where you go everyone really cares and everyone really wants to be good
00:08:55 is it competitive like what was it in the movie or no it's when you go through it's you know it's
00:09:01 if anything it's more of the students you know and then there's the instructor side and the instructor sides are really you
00:09:06 know they're guys that you know they just chose to stay up and fallon and it's extremely
00:09:13  difficult job  because they have they have a very small tolerance for not being good so they're briefs the
00:09:22 guys when they give a lecture so let's just say there's a fighter employment lecture which is one of the
00:09:27 hardest ones it takes about two days to give the fighter employment lecture the guy who gives the lecture goes
00:09:33 through multiple what they call a murder boards where he's scrutinized by his peers and he practices
00:09:37 by the time they actually stand in front of a class they pretty much have their 250
00:09:43 powerpoint slides memorized and they don't even turn around they just click and they know them in order
00:09:48 and they repeat the same thing over it's and it's standardized so they are extremely extremely
00:09:53 standardized when you go through school and there's a reason for that because what they're doing is they're
00:09:58 training so when you come out a top gun you're called a strike fighter weapons and tactics instructor
00:10:04 okay so your sfti when you come out of that your job is to go usually to one of the weapons schools on the east or west
00:10:09 coast and train the fleet squadrons and then you visit the squadrons and train and do
00:10:13 upgrade rides and all that so there's a there's a reason that they are extremely particular when you go through the
00:10:21 course it's it is literally one of the best things and it's not it's not a rank based thing because think oh navy
00:10:27 you can come in as a you know like a an o4 lieutenant commander the lieutenants the hierarchy or at
00:10:33 least to be i don't know how it is exactly today but i imagine it's the same the hierarchy is actually based on
00:10:39 seniority at the school not necessarily ranked so when the the tactical decisions are made which
00:10:44 are based on fact and and trying things out in the fallon ranges  they set this the top x number of
00:10:51 folks that have been there seniority wise is and i mean time wise  are the ones that actually make the decision and when
00:10:57 the door you may not agree but when the door opens and everyone comes out
00:11:03 from the staff they all speak the same language it's and it has to be that way which is why the school has been so effective
00:11:10 since it was founded so it's just a it's an incredible group of individuals so
00:11:17 there's a bar of excellence that  that the instructors demand well very much so and they're held to it
00:11:24 so it's not a hey i'm now an instructor so i can do what i want there is a standard and they have to
00:11:29 live up to that standard they have to and i mean every moment of every day
00:11:35  so if they go someplace if they go from fallon and they come down and do they're called site visits where they
00:11:39 come down and they'll come to la moore california which is where the west coast fighter wing is at for the navy
00:11:43 and they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadrons to kind of pass on some of that
00:11:50 knowledge that's that same high level of standard it's they can't just drop your guard because you wear the top gun patch and
00:11:56 people know that and they wear light blue shirts so it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there
00:12:01 and you know and then everyone else who's been through the school including them have the patch on their sleeve
00:12:05 so there's a standard that's expected when you come out of there so you're a navy pilot for 18 years yes
00:12:13 can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot yeah so you know first i was in i was enlisted i
00:12:20 was a marine and then the marines actually sent me recommended me to go to the naval
00:12:28 academy  so it's always better to be lucky than good but i got to go to naval academy and i
00:12:33 finished and i've had that dream to fly so when i got selected they've always dreamed of flying yeah since
00:12:39 1969 when i watched neil armstrong walk on the moon i was at that point i asked my mom i
00:12:44 remember watching it i was i was just prior to being five and i said wow yeah it's so cool mom and she said
00:12:53 well you know they were all pilots and  then at that point it was like i'm gonna be a pilot and
00:12:58 if you knew me growing up because i was a little bit of a delinquent people are just like yeah right i used
00:13:03 to joke i'm gonna fly i'm gonna fly jets and i'm gonna drop bombs then and if
00:13:08 people that knew me was a kid they'd be like yeah and they'd be like not a chance and then
00:13:14 when i did i actually had a funny story and i'll get to it and i'll finish my career but
00:13:18 i was at my cousin's wedding and  we all grew up in the same neighborhood  we kind of that italian side
00:13:25 of the family that's how we grew up so it was my house right down the street is my cousin chad and right around the
00:13:29 corner with my cousin ray and my aunts and uncles and stuff the guy two doors down from my and i was
00:13:33 a paper boy in the neighborhoods they all knew me and  i went to my cousin's wedding and
00:13:39 he and mr race looks at me and he says david fravor i go mr race how are you doing you guys
00:13:45 you fly jets top gun and all that i go yes sir i guess i figured he'd be in jail by now um
00:13:52 it was kind of a to me it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on you know i kind of overcame that but
00:13:57  what do you attribute that to so you i've heard you before and just now i'll say that  it's better be
00:14:02 it's better to be lucky than good and you you talk modestly about  about just being lucky
00:14:11 but if you were to describe your trajectory maybe in a way of advice like retrospectively  how did you pull it off to be like
00:14:23 to be truly a special person the easiest way is one never never take no don't let anyone put
00:14:29 you down and say you can't do it or those i mean i knew i knew what i was capable of inside you
00:14:34 know and if i really believe if you want something and you want to do something then you
00:14:40 you can achieve it not in all cases like if i loved basketball and i really wanted to be in the nba
00:14:47 there's a realism that says i'm five foot eight and i got like a really short vertical leap but i'm really not that
00:14:50 good at basketball it's probably not ever going to happen no matter how hard i try and practice
00:14:55 it's just the way it is or for me to be in the nfl i'm not fast you know i'm not that big
00:15:02 it's just physically i'm incapable of doing that but there's things that don't really
00:15:06 tie to a true physical ability as far as size and strength but
00:15:13 it's it's mental  and i'm not saying you have to be a genius and super smart to be a fighter pilot matter of fact you don't
00:15:19 it really comes down to the ability to think very quickly  80 solution is typically good enough
00:15:24 because if you overthink it you're you're behind and then in an air-to-air fight that's what happens
00:15:30 people try and overthink it and before you know it because it's happening so fast you don't have
00:15:35 you can't get to the nth degree you know six decimal places eighty percent solution is good enough
00:15:39 you build up a really strong gut for the 80 solution just yeah i'm a big believer in 80 percent solution i love that if you
00:15:44 get 80 percent you can go and then you can always adjust which is exactly what like if
00:15:49 you're fighting in bfm the 80 solution is it's like a chess game but it's a really really fast chess
00:15:54 game where you go i'm doing this and then i know that if i do a maneuver
00:15:59 if he's going to counter it correctly he should do a if he doesn't do a he does some degree
00:16:04 less like b c d and then i know how bad his his error is
00:16:10 and then i capitalize so my might i don't have to be perfect you know i have to go i need to go to 47 degrees nose high
00:16:16 if i just kind of get above 40 then i'm good and i can watch how he reacts and then i can adjust for that and you
00:16:21 and you continually work that problem and you chip away because if you start neutral you're just basically chipping away and
00:16:27 gaining advantage advantage advantage till eventually you know and if you're really you know
00:16:32 fighting you know just guns only rear quarter where you got to get behind the guy kind of world war ii dogfighting type
00:16:37 stuff then it's it's literally it's a it's a very very fast
00:16:44 chess game that happens at you know 400 knots 300 knots depends so to get to be one of the rare
00:16:49 individuals that  are able to do that he just had the dream and didn't take no for an answer well
00:16:57 you know you know part of it is family you know  my dad was  i used to call him a fire
00:17:04 ready aim guy you know he'd smack me and then ask me what i did wrong yeah
00:17:11 good parenting back then you know i i joke and and people look because you know at times it was kind of tough you
00:17:14 know because he can be pretty demanding but on the other side you know i probably needed to be
00:17:20 reined in a little bit at times  but then everyone else my family you know my mom was really awesome when i was a kid
00:17:28  my  my grandfather who is a big big part of it my mom's dad  who he taught me a lot and you have a
00:17:36 question there that we'll talk about  about him but  huge huge influence very very positive
00:17:43 and a lot of the stuff that i do today and decisions are based on things that he taught me
00:17:49 and  you know and i figured you know it was the first funeral i ever went to and it was 
00:17:55 it was about three miles long and church was overfilling and people were out he was a beer delivery guy
00:18:01 dead serious and you go there someone asked who died the pope so a lot of people love them so back to
00:18:07 back to my career yeah the first question because i'm getting down on rabbit hole 
00:18:12 no i when i was at the i was gonna i was gonna stay in the marines i really wanted to go
00:18:17 man i love the core i think it's  of all services it's that one everything is in a ball and they're very very
00:18:22 professional and it was a great great organization to join  but i went out to the nimitz on my 
00:18:29 freshman cruise after your freshman year at the naval academy you go out on a ship and you you're an enlisted person you
00:18:34 get to experience that half when i already was enlisted so it's fine with me because it comes up a lot would you mind
00:18:40 saying what the nimitz is what a ship is like yeah so nimitz is  an aircraft carrier so it's
00:18:45  four and a half acres of sovereign u.s territory that floats around the u.s oceans does it have weapons on it
00:18:52  the air wing is really the weapons it does have defensive weapons but for the most part it's a giant
00:18:59 moving airport is what it is so i was out there watching the airplanes land and take off
00:19:04 and i'm like oh and the squadrons that were out there one of the squadrons was a vf-41 and a 14 squadron
00:19:11 vf-84 an f-14 squadron and then a couple of a6 squadrons and we actually ended up part pairing up
00:19:15 and hanging out with some of the a6 pilots and bn's so it was really a neat experience and i said
00:19:21 i want to do that and the way to do it was to not to to go in the navy because there are
00:19:25 marine squadrons that go out to the aircraft carriers but most of them are land-based you know to
00:19:30 support the marines because they're that that unit that whole unit you know the marine corps is that one service has
00:19:35 it all and so when i graduated and i got to  you know i worked hard through
00:19:42 primary and that's where you know i knew missy  we were actually went through together missy cummings
00:19:48  we went through primary together and then  i went to kings we all selected the same time i went to kingsville there
00:19:53 was another guy scott wiedemeyer  the three of us so i went to kingsville scott went to beeville and missy went to meridian
00:20:01 so the three of us that we had all went through we got we selected out of primary together we all ended up going jets
00:20:07 and that's that's how besides from school i knew her at school too the long story i got done  got winged
00:20:12 it took me two years to the day from the time i graduated the naval academy until i got my wings
00:20:19 and  through some luck i ended up getting asics's on the west coast which is a
00:20:24 side-by-side bomber so it's a pilot on the left seat and the bombardier navigators on the right seat it was
00:20:28 built in the 60s it is all weather and it flies low at night it's got a terrain mapping radar
00:20:36 how many i guess is that a good term to use fighter jets as a broad category for for the public yeah that's probably how
00:20:42 many fighter jets are side by side like that that was  in the navy that was the only one the
00:20:48 air force the f-111 was a side-by-side but the navy it was the a6 and then there's the ea6b which is a derivative of
00:20:54 that and now that those are all gone the a6b's just went away a few years ago and now the
00:21:00 e18g growler is the replacement for the a6b there was never a replacement for the a6 that i flew
00:21:07 it really became the f-18 which the a6 could go quite a bit further distance wise by fuel than the hornet and  the horn is the
00:21:17 f-18 yeah is there usually two people in the plane but they're usually like in front and behind
00:21:23 in a the modern two-seaters yes  but most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single seat
00:21:27 so you can see just one person one person with the exception of i'll probably someone will yell at me
00:21:33 but really with the exception of the f-15e strike eagle and the f-18f super hornet which is the
00:21:38 f is a two-seater and the g is also a two-seater but it's more of an electronic attack by say
00:21:45 full-up fighter bomber so most of the time that you've flown in your like i said 18-year career
00:21:52 is was it two-seater i was about half and half so i started off an a6 was a two-seater then i went to single-seat f-18s and i
00:21:59 flew those all the way up until 2000 and let me think 2001 to the end of 2001
00:22:09 and then i shifted over and started flying the super hornets and i've flown both of those the ease and the s but i
00:22:15 deployed when i had command of vfa41 i had the two seat they were f squadron so you
00:22:22 eventually ended up commanding the the strike fighter squadron i love the the name the black aces what 
00:22:33 is there some parts of that journey that are amazing parts of it that are tough that kind of stand out
00:22:40 to me it was one it was a huge honor  and i got to serve with  you know i got pulled up because the the guy who
00:22:46 the the people that are exos because we fleet up you go from the number two guy to the number one guy
00:22:50 so the exo becomes the ceo so the executive officer becomes the commanding officer so i had worked with  now
00:22:58 soon to be vice admiral weitzel  was the he was commander whitefield at the time was the exo and he
00:23:04 really wanted because he knew there was a little bit of a problem when the super hornets came into lamore
00:23:11 lamore had been a single seat fighter community since the forever and now all of a sudden you've got the f-18f coming in
00:23:19 which has the weapon systems operators in the back that are not pilots they're weapon
00:23:23 systems operators and there's a difference and kenny is a weapon systems operator and 
00:23:31 kenny knew because of my a6 background that i have a switch that i can go one seat 2c1 c2c because when you fly 2c
00:23:37 there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take the advantage of the weapon systems
00:23:43 operator and it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment because it really
00:23:48 there's a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and the autonomy that
00:23:52 comes for the ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane flies but it does it does equal more than one
00:23:59 and i would say that one plus one with two people as well as a minimum of 1.5
00:24:05 because you've got an extra head you've got extra eyes you've got someone that can monitor systems the airplanes can do
00:24:11 two things at once i mean there's an incredible amount of capability that we add when we do that
00:24:16 can we just pause on that just for me from like a human factors perspective and also an
00:24:22 ai perspective what's how difficult  so there's like when there's two people
00:24:29 there's also a third person that's the ai part there's some level of automation like autopilot maybe
00:24:35 that's correct maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of like you said making decisions really quick 80
00:24:44 how do you deal with another brain working with you and then also the automation is there interesting
00:24:52 interplay that you get to learn and also as that change throughout your career i imagine it got
00:24:57 gotten better in terms of the automation or perhaps not well i can tell you so that let's say
00:25:02 there's a bunch of stars this is no this is this is good this is good and this is i'm enjoying this because
00:25:06 now we actually get to talk about something other than a tic tac so so let's start with the a6 the a6 was
00:25:11 really an analog airplane that was built in the 60s all right and there's been studies done
00:25:20 on the crew coordination which is the interaction between the pilot and the bombardier navigator
00:25:25 so we would fly low at night in the mountains so i was stationed up in whidbey island
00:25:30 washington so you've got the cascades and incredible  amount of time and we would get in the simulators because unlike
00:25:37 normally people think terrain following and there's the radars the 111 the b1 has a system like this but it'll
00:25:42 the radar can see and it'll fly it basically flies a straight line so it goes up and over mountains and back down
00:25:47 and up and over mountains where the a6 was really manual so you do this low-level routes where you're gonna
00:25:52 you're gonna fly in the mountains at night you're gonna be at you know 500 to 1000 feet above the
00:25:57 ground ripping through like fog layers because you don't need to see outside you're
00:26:01 you're literally flying a little tv screen and a radar what are you looking at most of the time so you just as a
00:26:06 screen it's this really primitive if you look at it now what we did you'd think wow that was crazy
00:26:12 but it was really fun so is it similar to like the flair stuff is that is no are you is it this thing
00:26:18 is totally radar based now the airplane had a flear ball it's a target recognition and
00:26:22 multi-sensor it's called a tram you're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects no actually what it
00:26:28 is is the the bombardier navigator had a radar and he was getting raw feed off of a pulse
00:26:33 radar in front okay so it's just basically mapping the mountain so if you look at a mountain on
00:26:39 a radar and you're coming up on it the front side is going to be it's going to give you a really bright return and
00:26:43 on the back side it's just going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on the other side
00:26:49 so the bomb of your navigators would do that and we they would have charts and they could
00:26:52 shade their charts knowing that hey if we turn a little bit left here we can get in this valley we can sneak up this
00:26:56 valley and then go around the back side of the mountain which is what the airplane would do and
00:27:00 so and sorry to interrupt i'm going to just keep asking dumb questions i apologize but
00:27:05 the pilot can you can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the bomb
00:27:10 bombardier  so you're you're actually just control i'm flying the jet i have the throttles
00:27:15 the stick and i have a  it's about a probably a four inch or six inch wide by maybe
00:27:24 four inches five inches high it looks like it's literally a crt that's how old it is a crt screen and
00:27:30 what it would do what the radar would do is the the the bombardier navigator is looking at his radar and he's looking
00:27:35 out about 12 and a half miles in front of the airplane so he has the range really scoped down
00:27:40 because the radar can see a lot further he's looking at about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode
00:27:45 where we're dodging mountains and stuff and what the pilot has is there's they're called range bins and there's
00:27:49 eight of them so the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile
00:27:55 you know and the closest range been it's a thing and it'll be like between like a half a mile
00:28:01 and or a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles
00:28:05 and then it just keeps going out like that so if there's a mountain for let's say we're on a flat plain
00:28:11 and there's a mountain out in the distance at 15 miles and we we're just driving right at it
00:28:16 so when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles where the radar is going to see it on his scope
00:28:22 my 12th my range bin for that would pop up and it would show like a big bump like a mountain
00:28:27 and then as i got closer to it the next arrangement would pop up and show it and i could see that that bump was
00:28:33 moving towards me and then if i turned a little bit you know to go over here i'd see the
00:28:37 mountain go over to the right hand side and i could do that but it wasn't like a video game it was it's literally like
00:28:45 if you think of the original ataris yeah but you build up i imagine that you start to get  a really deep sense
00:28:54 of like the actual three 3d environment based on that little atari's it's solid you're exactly right and you have to
00:28:59 you have to train so there's been studies a matter of fact a lot of the basis and people probably argue with me but
00:29:05 it's true there were studies done watching asics crews in our simulators we called it the wist
00:29:10 the weapon systems trainer and it was not even a motion it just kind of sat there and
00:29:14 you just you could fly these things they had terrain that they would inject into the system
00:29:19  but the crew coordination so you get so my first  my first fleet bombardier navigator
00:29:24 who who i'll name him his name's crusado  he's  works at apple  pretty high up bro mit grad
00:29:35 i think computer engineering he's scary smart so chris could really work and matter of fact all the guys that flew us so
00:29:41 there's another guy matt who also worked at apple who's now at sap we did our first night traps together
00:29:46 the bond between us i mean it's one of those things that you just you're never going to forget but chris and i when we
00:29:50 started flying together we were actually the most junior crew in the squadron  we'd spent a lot of time
00:29:58 training and and and chris was amazing at how he could work the system  one because he was extremely
00:30:03 brilliant and he was had that inquisitive mind of oh we could do all these different things and
00:30:07 there's all these degradation modes but we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get
00:30:15 because and it's you almost talk in partial so as the bn is looking at his radar scope
00:30:22 chris would say i've got rising terrain that's just what they say showing rising terrain at 12 miles and
00:30:26 i'd see the little bump and i'd say got it this is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you
00:30:31 work with two heads yes so when you first get together the interaction it's
00:30:37 it's it's almost like you have to rehearse it you have to know and you talk in full senses the more and more
00:30:47 we fly together chris could go i'm showing and he'd get like rising out and before he finished i'd say i've got it
00:30:54 so you end up starting to talk in partials because i have to trust him like
00:31:01 i mean there can be no i can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because i'm literally looking at this
00:31:07 little scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain moving remember the mountain's here
00:31:12 and then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the
00:31:16 system was set up remember it's an analog system to where he is telling me like i can't
00:31:21 see all the way to the left and he he's got a wider scope on the radar but my screen doesn't show that
00:31:27 so he's telling me start a left turn how to avoid a hard turn you know and we would do that so my
00:31:32 channel this is all happening quick very quick well you're doing we we would typically fly between 420 and 480 knots
00:31:41 of ground 70 miles an hour  well 427 miles a minute okay or eight months between seven and
00:31:46 eight miles a minute is what you're flying as fast at night i mean i broke out of clouds i
00:31:51 mean i remember him and i flying we're on it's the ir it's called an ir route  an
00:31:55 instrument route that's low they're all around the country there's ir344 that we used to fly which would coast in off of
00:32:01 or you'd fly from the land you go out over the ocean turn around and then you could practice actually coming in on a coastline
00:32:09 and we were flying and we ended up in the clouds keep in mind we're between 500 and 1000
00:32:13 feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds like you can't see anything and it had to
00:32:16 turn off our red lights that flash you know they're called the anti-collision lights because it was reflecting off the clouds
00:32:21 and it starts to bother you just gets annoying so i turned it off and we we're flying we're flying we're flying we break out
00:32:28 of that coastal marine layer and poof we break out and it's it's a decent night and this is right by mount st
00:32:34 helens this is kind of where we're coming in so we're coming in from the east and we're just north of mount st
00:32:38 helens is where the route goes and you look up you know because you can kind of see the silhouette of this
00:32:41 mountain that's right next to you but you're flying along you're just like you know you gotta trust
00:32:46 and you can see houses you can see the lights they're above you we're literally below people's houses flying down these
00:32:50 valleys and stuff so just incredible experience so when you take that and then you move into
00:32:57 an f-18f so now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century
00:33:02   and you're flying so now you know the wizzo is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels but that
00:33:07 same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is
00:33:13 you're sharing the load so most of the communications that go out of the airplane the wizzo does all the talk and
00:33:18 he's got actually he uses the feet that's the weapon systems operator in the back of an f-18f
00:33:24 so he's going to run well the radar kind of runs itself now but we have a situational awareness
00:33:29 display and it's it's linked to all the other errors just like curiosity what's the situational awareness display
00:33:33 because that term comes up a lot think of it as  think of it as a god's eye view so if you have a the back of the super
00:33:39 hornet has well the block twos has about an eight by ten display for the wizzos that they can look at the pilots is
00:33:45 smaller it's down between us it's a six by six between his legs and they're they're getting ready to redesign that
00:33:50 boeing is but when you look it'd be like if you put your airplane and you're looking down so
00:33:55 all the stuff like if your radar seeing bad guys out in front of you be like looking down going oh i'm right here and
00:34:00 now there's bad guys out here and my wingman is over here and it shows everything it's just like
00:34:04 it gives you you can look at that display and go oh okay i can see where everything's at i can
00:34:08 see if one guy's trying to target another guy it shows you all this it's an incredible
00:34:13 amount of knowledge that comes up for the crews to maintain  the the overall picture of what's going
00:34:20 on big picture sense of what's going on because it's happening so fast and this is with that autonomy piece
00:34:26 this is the third brain so we're all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion
00:34:30 it's pulling stuff together going oh this is all this guy this is this guy this this guy it's sending it out
00:34:34 through the link so all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network
00:34:38 you know that we don't even see it just says that airplane says hey i'm over here and it tells us and we go oh he's
00:34:43 right there and then we can go he's his airplane says oh i'm looking at this airplane
00:34:48 this bad guy and it shows us oh he's he's over there and he's looking at this guy i mean it's an incredible
00:34:55 amount of  visual intake because your eye you can hear a lot but when you look down at stuff it's  you know you can
00:34:59 solve the picture really quick the third brain is doing the sensor fusion  the integration of the
00:35:07 different sensors and gives you a big picture view what about the control like is there and
00:35:11 i apologize as if this is a dumb question but you know people use the high level term
00:35:20 of autopilot how much is there let's use a loose term of ai how much automation is there how much ai is there in
00:35:27 helping you control there the ai piece would be more of a control loop because the digital flight controls so
00:35:33 the airplane actually they had to make the airplane easier to fly and when i say easy it's relative
00:35:38 because people go i could do it because i did it on flight sim it's real life is a lot different in
00:35:43 flight sim you have no apparent fear of death you'll do things in simulator that you would never do in real life but
00:35:50  the the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage i mean because you think about it you've
00:35:55 got a radar that's feeding you data you've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data all that stuff is
00:35:59 hooked to your head because you've got a joint helmet mounted queuing system on that basically
00:36:04 maps the magnetic field in the cockpit so it can tell where your heads at looking so if i turn my head to the right the
00:36:09 radar will actually look to the right the targeting flare will look to the right and oh by the way the backseater has a
00:36:15 helmet on too so he can look to the left and he can do things so depending on what sensor he's controlling
00:36:21 so if he's got control of the targeting pod and he looks left the targeting pod looks left but if i have something where i
00:36:27 want to lock a guy up that i don't see that maybe the radar didn't see but i can get over and now point the radar you
00:36:30 know get the because it's a it's a phase array radar now it doesn't really scan
00:36:36  there's there's all kinds of cool stuff that  that technology  brings because if you
00:36:42 just if you went back 30 years and said hey or 40 years ago and said hey we're gonna have this helmet and you're gonna be
00:36:47 able to slew everything to your head and i don't mean a mechanical setup but i mean literally you're just gonna map
00:36:53 magnetic resonance and go oh look and then i can i can literally slew my sensors this fast
00:36:59 and then mash a button and transfer you know high quality coordinates from a system into a joint
00:37:04 you know a jdam which is a joint direct attack munition that is the gps bombs that you see all the time
00:37:10 and then let that thing fly and i'm i'm solving this problem in seconds by minutes or hey i got it
00:37:16 we're gonna have to menstruate coordinates and you know you bring back the data and
00:37:19 then they do all the targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it
00:37:24 instead of all that now it's that fast so there's a okay i mean we probably don't have
00:37:28 enough time to talk about the beautiful fusion of mines that happens when two people are flying
00:37:34 controlling the plane but at a high level this is a really interesting question for people who
00:37:39 don't know what they're talking about like me which is what is the difference between
00:37:44 a human being and an ai system like what can what is the ceiling of a current
00:37:53 ai technology for controlling the plane like how much does the human contribute  is it
00:37:58 possible to have automated flight for example like what is the hardest part about flying
00:38:07 that a human does expertly that an ai system cannot in warfare situations in in
00:38:18 flying a fighter jet lane so i would say systems are usually black and white when you write the algorithm for an ai system
00:38:25 it's it's it's it's really it's basically you're taking thought and turning it into a giant math
00:38:29 problem is really what you're doing right so you've got this logical math problem math problems are
00:38:35 there's there's there's a line it says i can or i can't and it's a it's a very finite line
00:38:40 you know but you can go up to the line where a human we all have gray areas where we go
00:38:48 maybe yeah i'll try it so he just can operate within that gray so if you took if you take an airplane and say and i'll
00:38:53 just take a hornet for a while a super horn it doesn't matter any airplane and you go here is the flight
00:38:59 performance model of the airplane so if you know an  an em diagram is the energy so it basically says
00:39:05 the airplane can fly as slow as this it can go as fast as this it can pull this many g's force of gravity you know so one two
00:39:11 three four five six seven and then based on the airfoil design and everything else and how it can pull
00:39:17 here's how it's going to fly you know because it's really physics based well if you depending on how you write
00:39:23 the ai but typically ai you don't want the airplane to leave controlled flight right you want to maintain it so that it
00:39:29 is flying in a controlled envelope or there are times and you can go back to world war one
00:39:35 where people intentionally departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage which is
00:39:40 that's where the human goes can i do this i know it's outside of where i would normally go
00:39:47 but i can do that so you can do some crazy things now especially since the flight control logic
00:39:52 in modern airplanes with digital flight controls they're extremely forgiving so you can literally i've done things in super
00:40:00 hornets that literally even as a pilot inside the airplane you're just like wow i cannot
00:40:05 believe it just did that like it'll flop ends which defies most logic and i guess
00:40:11 you know in a way you could probably program it but i still think that when you get to the edges
00:40:16 that may or may not give you an advantage there are things that a human can will do
00:40:23 that ai won't and i don't think we've got to the point because how do you how do you map illogical solutions
00:40:30 you know most ai is logical it's based on some type of premise when you write the algorithm to control it
00:40:38 there's bounds yeah there's this giant mess like you said the difference between the
00:40:42 simulator and real life also gets at that somehow that there is  somehow the the fear of death all of that
00:40:51 beautiful mess comes into play like is there a comment you can make on commercial flight like with sully landing
00:41:01  that plane famously  versus the simulator all of those discussions is there some
00:41:06 well it's it's very it's very similar what i was talking about earlier with the a6 so
00:41:11 one is when you're flying with a crew  their standardization so you gotta remember when sully flew
00:41:16 when his first officer that's the co-pilot showed up you know first time they met and this happens all the time in the
00:41:22 commercial world you know there's six seven thousand pilots at united airlines you know your chance of flying
00:41:26 with the same guy all the time is slim and none we're in the navy we were crude so i had a primary and a
00:41:33 secondary wizzo that flew with me for a while for months oh hell yeah for like all of the deployment
00:41:40 so because you want to use you have to trust all of those things it increases the capability airplane it's not to say we
00:41:45 can't swap out but for true effectiveness especially in very complex missions like
00:41:51 forward air controller we're in the air actually controlling ground assets and if you're in a high threat area which is
00:42:00 crazy busy you have to you have to be melded when you do that you have to have trained to
00:42:05 do that job otherwise you're going to be ineffective so when you get to the commercial world and i've got
00:42:13 tons of friends at fly commercial there is a standardization like we know that at this point i'm
00:42:17 going to put this switch you're going to do that and everyone they know their rules captain's going to
00:42:22 do this first officer's going to do this and they know that when the emergency breaks out so in sully's case
00:42:27 when they take the birds and they know they've got a problem and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings of
00:42:33 him the two of them talking you know you gotta remember they're talking to each other when you hear the
00:42:37 full tapes but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in the new york area
00:42:42 and it's like we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows hey silence the alarm they silence the alarm
00:42:46 the first officer is pulling out the book he's going through the procedures while sully's actually flying the
00:42:51 airplane knowing that they've lost their motors and you got to think his decision process like they're trying to get him
00:42:56 to go into an airport into new jersey and he realizes not happening we're going to put this thing and he made a
00:43:01 decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane that he was going to put this
00:43:05 thing in the hudson river and he did it flawlessly i mean every single person walked away from that
00:43:11 wreck the only thing that didn't survive was the airplane you know and it got fished out of the hudson but
00:43:15 what is it about those human decisions he had to make is that something you put into words or
00:43:20 is that just deep down some instinct that you develop as a pilot over time it's when we
00:43:27 when you train  you know an aviation is a self-cleaning oven so if you make bad decisions
00:43:32 you're you know and the list is long and distinguished of those who have died by making bad decisions
00:43:38 oh man so when you look at what he did or the way we train because the the commercial industry and
00:43:44 the navy and the air force for all that we have what's called we have emergency procedures that we have to know like engines on
00:43:50 fire the first three steps you just have to know what they are right so they know the airline  same
00:43:56 type you know they go hey i know this is they pull the book out because the airplanes are designed they're built to
00:44:00 have some time but there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't
00:44:04 second-guess it so when he decided i'm putting this in the hudson river he couldn't all of a sudden halfway
00:44:09 through it go well maybe i can get over to that airport he he looked he made a quick assessment
00:44:13 this is that 80 solution where you go these are not i'm you know it's
00:44:18 like a multiple choice test when you go oh my god i don't really know the answer but i know a and d
00:44:23 are wrong yeah gone so the jersey airport and going back to laguardia gone yeah so what's my next option well the
00:44:30 hudson river's there and that's probably looking pretty good or what is my other one can i get a restart on the the motors
00:44:36 and then if i can get a restart now can i take it someplace else he had to make really really fast
00:44:42 decisions and then once they as they they go that 80 solution you realize all right i'm going into the hudson
00:44:46 there's the 80 percent get the book out let's see if we can get an error star because if you listen to the tapes
00:44:50 they're trying to get it air started the closer he gets to the water the more he's going i'm ditching the airplane
00:44:57 so the original decision to this is my best option right now this is where i'm going and you start
00:45:03 eliminating anything that could possibly change the events which they tried to do and then he gets to that last minute says
00:45:09 we're going in the water they change the plan they secure the airplane they do exactly what they're
00:45:13 doing and he does that basically flawless landing on the on the hudson but you got to remember
00:45:19 every s it's every six months for commercial they go back and they do research in the airplane in the
00:45:25 simulator where they train to the airplane being broken you just lost a motor you just lost another motor
00:45:31 so they go through this extensive training you know and all these and it's you know you know
00:45:36 we used to refer to it in the navy as the pain cave where you're gonna get in because you know
00:45:40 that when you get in for your check ride in a simulator that the airplane is going to break
00:45:44 you're going to lose hydra and it's sometimes there a problem like oh i just lost this hydraulic system but i'm
00:45:48 having an issue on the other motor well if i shut down this motor and i've got a hydraulics you know
00:45:52 because there's two hydraulic systems one on each motor well if i've got an issue with the left
00:45:57 motor hydraulic system and my right motor is starting to give me indications do i want to shut the right motor down
00:46:02 because that's going to kill my hydraulic system that's good and now i'm flying on a good motor with
00:46:07 a bad hydraulic system and without hydraulics the airplane won't fly so they it's a really they're challenging
00:46:11 problems that you have to think through in real time and of course the weather's never good it's always dark
00:46:17 it's always crappy you're going to break out it i mean it's just all this stuff gets compiled on top of you
00:46:23 and it's intended to increase the level of stress because when things happen like in
00:46:28 sully's case we like to joke it's going to stem power you know where the functional part of
00:46:33 your brain shuts down and you are literally on instinct like an animal well if you've trained so much that that
00:46:38 is the instinctive reaction that you're going to have when the main part of your your your
00:46:44 cognitive abilities start to shut down your you're running that instinct is ingrained so much into you that you know
00:46:50 exactly what to do and that's literally how it happens so there's no
00:46:56 how do i put it fear of death like in sully's case do you think he was at all ever thinking
00:47:02 about the fact if his decision is wrong a lot of people are going to die you know i can't speak for him but i
00:47:08 would say there was so much going on in the cockpit in that time his his mindset was probably
00:47:16 i can do this i'm trained i'm going to do the procedures i've practiced this before i've done these things and you know i'm
00:47:22 assuming that in his mindset because i never thought about when things were really bad you know if you're having
00:47:26 problems with the airplane that you know that i was going to mort you know and and planted into the ground it
00:47:30 was always you know maybe it's an ego thing where you think i can do this i mean
00:47:37 so you never have you experienced fear during flight like i mean one one way who just offline
00:47:45 mentioning mike tyson he talked about like  as he's  walking up to the ring he's like
00:47:56 he starts out basically in fear and  yeah worried about how things are going to go i mean it's
00:48:02 purely to put in towards his fear but as he gets closer and closer to the ring is the confidence grows and grows until the
00:48:10 ego basically takes over to where you think there's no way anybody could  defeat me
00:48:17 so like that's that's his experience of overcoming fear but do you  did you experience any kind of
00:48:23 thing like that or is that or do you just go to the part of the brain that goes to the training
00:48:28 and then you just go to the instinctual 80 solution i wouldn't say i was never afraid i
00:48:34 think that would be i can't i couldn't tell you that anyone i know that wasn't afraid at one time and
00:48:40 for most of us especially navy carrier pilots it's just it's it's usually especially when you're
00:48:45 new and you got to go out and it's nighttime and there's no moon and the weather sucks and the deck's moving
00:48:51 you know the ship's going up and down because it will scare lover living out of you
00:48:56 can i say that you can definitely say that so it's about landing or take off that that is if you even they used
00:49:01 to wire people up they did it during vietnam you know guys that go flying missions you know when they were flying low and
00:49:06 crazy stuff was going on and people were getting shot down a lot  the highest
00:49:11 the highest anxiety and heart rates were coming back to land on board an aircraft carrier how hard is it to land on that
00:49:17 it seems impossible like for for a civilian i guess like me it just seems crazy that a human can do that the
00:49:24 problem with night is and there's different degrees of night just like day i mean there's the
00:49:30 clear full moon night you know where it's like oh yeah you know this is not that bad
00:49:36 but you gotta remember at night i think everyone can associate with you're driving in your car and it's just
00:49:41 a it's it's an overcast dark night and you're on a country road with no side lights
00:49:48 most people have a tendency to slow down just by nature of oh my god because you what you'll do is you'll out drive your
00:49:52 headlights because it is so dark you know you can get outside you get outside the city and get up into new hampshire
00:49:59 especially when the roads are curving you know and the lines probably aren't that good
00:50:04 it's you know now take that and multiply it by like a million because you have no depth perception 
00:50:12 what you think is fixed the runway is actually moving up and down and left to right
00:50:18 yeah oh and when it's really bad you can actually see it move and  we have two systems  you know
00:50:23 there was a there's an automatic system that's actually  it stabilizes with the inertials on the ship
00:50:31 and then there's the ils now civilian pilots will tell you that ils is a precision approach which gives you
00:50:36 azimuth and glide slope you know you come down it's like a plus on the carrier it's not it's really just
00:50:41 a beam that goes out and it's considered a non-precision approach it's it's not stabilized at all that and i've
00:50:47 been where you can actually watch the needle and the and the attack hand needle will move there's all
00:50:51 kinds of stuff moving because the base that it's all sitting on is doing this and ships don't just go up
00:50:56 and down they they do this so the bow goes up and down and the tail like you normally see a ship
00:51:01 and then there's so that's pitch and then it has roll so it's doing this and then it has heave
00:51:06 so the whole boat is going up and down while it's pitching and rolling and you're gonna land on that so
00:51:13 and it's i mean i remember landing as i was with chris  sado and  chris and i we're off the
00:51:19 uss ranger which is now decommissioned it's sitting getting turned into razor blades we're flying the old a6 and we come
00:51:25 in and it was off of san diego and it was just an ugly night because san diego always has a marine layer that
00:51:30 is about 1200 feet was lower than that that night and it was pouring down rain it was an
00:51:34 el nino year and there's thunderstorms all around it was just the craziest night i've ever seen out of san diego
00:51:40 and i remember landing and your adrenaline is so high that you're shaking i mean you literally can't stop
00:51:45 and we had spun around out of the landing area and we parked we caught the six-pack so it's right in front of the
00:51:49 island so if you see an aircraft carrier of the island and the number of the ship on it we're sitting right in
00:51:54 front of that and we're looking at the landing area so it's like you get front row seats to the concert and
00:52:01 and this this this ea 6b comes in you know ugly pass he ends up catching a one wire which is the first one you
00:52:06 never want to catch the first one which means you were not really high above the back of the
00:52:11 ship when you landed and it comes in and the exhaust on an ea 6 or an a6 actually points kind of down
00:52:17 and it blows and it's blowing all the standing water on the aircraft that's how hard it's raining and you literally
00:52:22 could not see a cross i mean i could see the front of my airplane his airplane and then it was just white because of
00:52:27 the water being blown off the deck and i'm shaking and i i i'll never forget i looked over at chris and i said
00:52:32 oh my god i go hey dude man ten thousand foot runway looks really good right now and i go and i'm shaking
00:52:38 my hands like this and i said i'm not even this is i'm not faking this dude i know that's literally i cannot
00:52:42 stop shaking i said that scared the evil out of me yeah um
00:52:49 but you but it scares you afterwards you don't during it you're not i'm not you don't have time to think about that
00:52:53 you're doing it you got to do this you know kind of the quote from tom hanks and 
00:52:59 what's that the girls baseball movie where he goes there's no crying in baseball oh yeah that's our joke there's no
00:53:04 crying in naval aviation i said you can fly around and cry all you want at night but you know there's only one
00:53:09 pilot in those airplanes and you got to land it so you try all you want wipe the tears away
00:53:14 you know putting on your big kid pants and it's it's time to it's time to you know man up and land
00:53:18 atlanta jet sorry for the romantic question but going back to the the kid that dreamed
00:53:28 what's it like to fly an airplane what it looks incredible like as a human like a descendant of
00:53:35 vape i sit here on land and look up at you guys it seems incredible that a human being can do that
00:53:42 you know people ask you know i'll be sitting around with my friends and they're like how was i said
00:53:48 the greatest job on the planet i said you know you it's it's an office with a view
00:53:53 because you're sitting in a glass you you can do  you know it's like roller coasters you
00:53:59 go oh it does all these cool stuff so we take people flying every once awhile and it's like oh yeah i like roller
00:54:04 coasters like you know take any roller coaster the coolest roller coaster you've ever been on
00:54:09 and multiply it by a thousand i said it's an experience  you know to put your body under you know
00:54:15 you know the jets rated at seven and a half but it'll pull up to 8.1 before it over stresses depends on fuel weight
00:54:21 so i mean you routinely get up there towards eight g's to be able to do that to your body i
00:54:27 mean it takes a toll like i can't really turn my head real good anymore and and stuff like that but
00:54:32  would i trade it i mean it was a childhood dream and how many people get to do that
00:54:37 you know professional i want to be a nfl you know and you end up to the nfl which is a very small percentage but
00:54:44 well i want to fly jets and and to fly you know at the time when i was flying the super hornets that we had on our
00:54:48 squadron were brand new like literally right out of the factory i'd come off our first super hornet cruise
00:54:53 we had went to the boeing factory in st louis where they were building my new jets that i was going to get and i
00:54:57 actually signed the inside of one of the wings while they were putting it together so i'm meeting the people that are putting
00:55:02 the jet together that's going to get delivered to me in a couple of months that i'm going to fly
00:55:09 so  just i mean the whole of it is it's incredible i i it's i'll tell you what when i left
00:55:15 when i decided to walk away  yeah did i miss it i told myself i wouldn't i promised myself
00:55:22 that you know once you get through your o5 command your flying really starts to tag to come down you know even if you and
00:55:29 you're an airwing commander which is we call them cag carrier group commander you're not flying as much as like the
00:55:36 normal pilots nor should you be i mean there's young people that are coming up and it's training your relief because that's the
00:55:40 next generation so like currently i have friends of mine that we serve together
00:55:47 their kids are flying super hornets right so to me that's really neat because i
00:55:52 watched them when they were little and now you know one of them who was good friends 
00:55:58 is i won't get his last name but joey who lived down the street from us is a top was a top gun instructor and i'm like
00:56:04 hey joey's joe's a top gun you know and i'm like that's cool because you know i went there and i knew
00:56:08 him he would come down to my house and now to see these kids that are because typically military breeds
00:56:13 military you know because the kids grew up in it i mean and i the only reason that my son is not
00:56:18 doing it is he's colorblind so it it disqualifies you for being a pilot being a seal
00:56:23 because he he talked about doing that because he's an incredible swimmer and he likes doing that stuff and water polo player
00:56:31 but he's you know both my kids are well my daughter is a doctor and my son's in his third year so but
00:56:37 there's a i suppose i mean from my perspective a bittersweet handover of this incredible experience
00:56:44 of flying to the younger generation so you don't you told yourself you're not going to
00:56:49 miss it you miss it  there are days i do when i hear
00:56:55 jets like if i'm around a base or a jet flies over but i have all the memories so i can
00:56:59 look at it and go it can't go on forever you know tom brady can't play football there's
00:57:05 going to come a time where he has to stop he seems to have done it for a long time but you know typically
00:57:10 when you look at ego i had the opportunity and i think as automation moves on especially with ai
00:57:18 that you know when will when will the last manned fighter be built you know and that's that big question
00:57:24 you know we just did f-35 it's over budget it's seven years late there's all kinds of issues when we try
00:57:28 and do it and then you look at some of the new stuff that's coming out that the air
00:57:34 force is working on with smaller cheaper  attributable platforms that you can go oh
00:57:40 we can because if you don't put a man in the box or a person because there's a lot of
00:57:45 incredibly talented women that do this too so i'll just say that as person yeah so we say man
00:57:52 and he we mean both men and women because offline you've told me about a lot of incredible women that flown so
00:57:59 i had i had three three female actually four one of them didn't fly anymore she actually lives right around here
00:58:05 she she's  she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she couldn't fly anymore 
00:58:11 one of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly she's one of the most gifted people i've ever met in my life she is the vice
00:58:17 president of amazon air you can see her on tv her name is sarah incredible and then i had  paige who
00:58:24 ended up taking command  she got out of fighters and went into other platforms
00:58:29 and she was a commanding officer and then the other one is a teacher's leadership and she is all
00:58:35 three of them actually all four of the women that were direct 
00:58:40 i'm not forgetting i don't think i'm forgetting someone  incredibly incredibly talented  and a
00:58:45 great addition to the reading room so anyone who gets into the oh you know women can't do it that's all total horse crap
00:58:51 you know we can talk about the original integration and stuff which was not done well by the military nor the navy
00:58:58 so women can fly as good as the guys yeah you can't tell if you pass another airplane you can't tell if there's a man
00:59:02 or woman in it it really comes down to  stick and throttle extrapolate where the vehicle is going
00:59:12 to be where the airplane would be if you're fighting another one you have to be able to think fast anyone
00:59:17 has those characteristics  can do it and then i think most important besides that
00:59:21 there has to be a desire yeah and i'm not saying that everyone if you took because we used to track so
00:59:25 when i ran we call it the rag it's the replacement air group it's where so the
00:59:30 the super hornet training squadron there's two of them there's one on the east coast
00:59:34 106 and there's one on the west coast which is vfa 122. 122 is the first one so i ended up going
00:59:39 there and i ended up being the operations officer and training officer okay so we tracked the last hundred students
00:59:47 right so everyone goes ah it's funny to hear students talk because oh he's awesome he's super if you took the hundred
00:59:53 there's three at the top of the list that are just naturally gifted aviators they're well well well above average
00:59:59 it's like the person in a math class that sits down in complex math and they just get it you know at the bottom
01:00:05 there's the three at the bottom that are gonna struggle and there's a good chance they won't get out and if they do get out
01:00:11 they're gonna have to work really hard to just maintain kind of average sometimes it's just the way your mind
01:00:17 works not everyone is good at everything if you took the 94 of them in the middle they're within one mean deviation
01:00:24 of you know it's there they're all you know it's a the bell curve doesn't look real good
01:00:28 it's just a big hump and it comes back down and everyone's right there within one mean deviation and then you have the outliers
01:00:34 usually not on the high side because they're going to get through but the outliers on the low side that don't make
01:00:38 it through so for the most part the navy does a really good job as does the air force
01:00:44 of screening so now what they do when i went you just showed up and you started now what you do is you actually go fly
01:00:49  piper warriors low wing to see can you are you adaptable to this
01:00:54 and there's an evaluation that goes through and then if you hit a certain mark then you're good to go and then
01:00:58 they put you into primary it's kind of like a it's like a pre-check you know like the
01:01:03 preset the pre-sat to go hey how am i going to do on the sat it's it's very similar to that but it's more
01:01:08 of a hand skill can you adapt because although we live in three dimensions like this table is not
01:01:15 you know we this is you know this is all has depth with all that  where it's really relative to
01:01:20 aviation we are two-dimensional very two-dimensional can you explain that so our perception is actually more
01:01:27 limited than the than that of an aviator very much and here's why yeah so we look at
01:01:33  let's look at a tall building let's look at one world trade center in new york because that's
01:01:37 everyone knows what it looks like big tall building it's what maybe 1800 feet tall even the
01:01:44 burjal dubai which is like what 20 700 feet tall it's not that big so a super hornet to do a what a split s is
01:01:50 which is i'm flying i'm just going to roll the airplane upside down and then i'm going
01:01:54 to do basically a c the letter c i'm going to go in the top and out the bottom
01:02:00 so and i'm just basically a vertical displacement of the airplane so i'm going from high to low
01:02:05 it's very very tight and it doesn't in about roughly about 2 500 feet give or take a little so you go that is
01:02:12 that is a really tight vertical turn yeah for example the a6 in order to do that was about 9 000 feet
01:02:18 and we look at a building that's 2000 feet high and think that is tall right all right so in an aviation
01:02:24 sense when you're starting to do vertical displacement maneuvers going from 35 000 feet down to 20 000 feet in
01:02:29 a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane because the human brain thinks we
01:02:35 really are we like to be flat i see we think 2d so if i'm fighting how you really get an
01:02:39 advantage when you're fighting another airplane is to work in the vertical
01:02:44 because most people will do like one move in the vertical and then they want to start to flatten out because that's
01:02:48 where we're comfortable yeah it's very profound do you still think in like stacks of 2d layers or no
01:02:55 or do you do you truly start to think in that third dimension like the rich 3d world of 
01:03:04 like a fighting like do you start to actually be able to really experience the 3d nature
01:03:10 you do because you have to project where you're going to be so you have to know the performance of the airplane knowing
01:03:15 that hey if i do this maneuver that i am going to go it's it's kind of like when i when i
01:03:19 talk about when we were chasing the tic tac so the tic tac's coming up and i'm in about you know and i've been doing this for
01:03:26 at the time 16 years so i'm looking and i'm going hey i'm here he's there on the other side of the
01:03:30 circle i'm going to do a vertical displacement i'm going to go like this i'm going to cut across a circle and i'm
01:03:34 not going to him i'm going out in front of him i'm going over here because i know that by the time i get
01:03:38 through this maneuver that's where he's going to be and i'm trying to you know basically join up on him
01:03:42 but i also i also had to look at it to go do i have enough altitude to do this because what i
01:03:46 didn't if we're here and i do this i'm going to end up over here and he's going to be above me and then
01:03:50 you know i have to get that energy back to get up to him and when you're doing a max performance
01:03:57 it's a trade so you have this is this is really important when you're when you're fighting airplanes and you're really
01:04:01 max performing so when you go to an air show and you see the air demo he's literally playing with it he's got
01:04:06 a finite amount of energy right he can add some with the motors and stuff but you're what you're really
01:04:11 doing is it's a trade-off and you can trade off kinetic energy speed for altitude which
01:04:16 gives you potential energy the other piece is is i can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance
01:04:22 because i know if i do a nice easy turn the airplane will make it what doesn't bleed energy but i know if
01:04:28 i do a real tight that 2500 foot split s that it's going to cost me energy so if i enter the split s at 200 knots and i
01:04:33 do it right i'm going to come out at the bottom at probably 200 knots although i lost 2500 feet of potential energy
01:04:41 i converted that to that to kinetic and that kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings
01:04:45 in order for me to get that high performance turn and you have to constantly evaluate where you're at and it's your
01:04:51 overall energy package so you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like he's going to kill you
01:04:57 but if this jet is at 400 knots and this jet is at 110 knots this jet's just going to pull away drive
01:05:03 around and kill him in about 30 seconds right it's it's overall energy package and that's that
01:05:08 you've got to be constantly evaluating where you're at and this is that 80 solution can i afford to do this or not
01:05:12 yes no and you have literally a split second to make the decision the most incredible dance of human decision making
01:05:19 is just incredible i know a million people want me to talk about tic tac and i i
01:05:23 definitely will but let me ask the one last  ridiculous   subjective question
01:05:36 you don't history to like from pure speed i would say sr-71 i think it's an engineering marvel that was actually
01:05:42 developed in the 50s by kelly johnson you know skunk works for what that was able to do and when you get into history
01:05:47 of it you know how they actually built  the cia actually made like six companies in order to buy the
01:05:54 titanium from russia to bring it back and build an airplane out of titanium that we would fly over russia
01:06:00 to me that's it's an incredible engineering marvel i think that like the x-15 you know by the way
01:06:07 this sr sorry to interrupt sr-71 still holds the the speed record for of any plane as far as i can understand
01:06:14 yeah what's funny when you get into it is it's remember fast is relative and when i say
01:06:19 that i mean so if you're going 3 000 miles an hour 100 feet above the ground you're going 3
01:06:29 through you know that's how fast you're going when you get up to altitude there's an indicated airspeed and
01:06:33 there's a you know your ground speed so your indicated airspeed is really
01:06:38 how fast the air is going past your airplane well the air is so thin up there you may only be showing like 300 knots
01:06:46 but at 300 knots you're really doing 2500 miles an hour over the ground so you know like we would take the
01:06:52 airplanes up to 50 000 feet when we had to do full the maintenance check flights on
01:06:57 them so when you're doing 200 you know and you know some mod notch it's actually slow for the airplane it's
01:07:02 you know you're getting you know it's kind of like it's not you know there's maneuvering speeds
01:07:06 you know that if i hit a certain speed and a super hornet that i have the full capability of the airfoil
01:07:11 if i'm below that speed i'm going to stall the airfoil before i get to the maximum g
01:07:17 okay so when you look at something like that you go is it really going fast and when you
01:07:22 look at an sr 71 that's flying upwards of you know 70 plus thousand feet the air so thin
01:07:27 you know just like the x15 you can get to a much higher speed but the relative speed of the air
01:07:31 going over you is actually relatively low so the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be if you were down low
01:07:37 but because you're going fast to get enough air over your ketostatic system to show that you're going 300 knots
01:07:43 you're you're screaming i mean the fastest i ever got was i was with the
01:07:49  well soon to be vice admiral white so we had taken a check flight and  and i got it up to 1.78 i got a super
01:07:56 horn up to mach 1.78 and it was and we were started by pebble beach too and then it what's that feel like or is it
01:08:02 when you get that fast it start to me it got a little bit weird because you realize in your brain and i did that there's no out
01:08:10 if something happens i can't eject the ejection would kill me isn't that kind of liberating in a way
01:08:15 or no that okay maybe not i always want to push the limit you know it's like how fast i
01:08:19 could have got it going faster it was it was literally still accelerating when i stopped but i had it
01:08:23 was fuel limited and space limited because i you know i'm off the coast of california
01:08:29 big sur and i'm going and i can see pebble beach out in the distance  you know the whole monterey peninsula just going
01:08:36 and you're doing almost 18 miles a minute i mean you're screaming yeah i mean that's and then you have to
01:08:41 turn well the airplane didn't have anything on it it was a slicked-off super hornet so it was basically just
01:08:46 the airplane no pylons no pods no nothing and then we had to get it turned around because we got to go to the exit point
01:08:50 for the area and i'm trying to get it down below to subsonic and there's a bunch of
01:08:55 things that are disabled like the speed brakes that normally we pop out when you're going that fast they don't
01:08:59 because the super hornet really doesn't have speed brakes it deforms the flight controls they don't
01:09:05 function so you really you're trying to maneuver and when you're going that fast you can't turn
01:09:09 because a 7g turn at 1.5 mach is a pretty big turn so it's just it's crazy it's
01:09:18 incredible that a human can do this yes  human can engineer that the system which allows another human to
01:09:24 control that system it's to me it's it's  i think it's just it's one it's a great experience
01:09:31 was it sad to see the sr-71 go i think it was during your career i mean do you do you guys romanticize the
01:09:37 different planes we would see it flying when i was flying hornets because we i
01:09:42 the west coast flies in it's called r2508 which is covers the navy China  lake area and edwards it's a
01:09:48 huge area it's it's actually i think the we had a guy from switzerland come out because they
01:09:52 were they had hornets and he's like this is bigger than our whole country because it's a pretty big area in
01:09:57 california that you fly but you would see the sr-71s they had a loop because nasa was flying them
01:10:02 out of palmdale and they would take off and they'd go up towards washington state and montana and they do a loop and so
01:10:06 you'd see them coming back down they'd descend out of you know above 60 000 you'd see them you they get contrails
01:10:10 you know the white lines behind airplanes they'd come down and hit the tanker and they'd go back up so
01:10:16 it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying  but  you know i think with money
01:10:26 age the advent of satellites you know because they're everywhere now i mean you've got commercial companies
01:10:30 putting satellites up  how much of that need was really there because you gotta remember when
01:10:35 those things started in the 50s sputnik wasn't flying around you know it was it was the u2 and the
01:10:39 sr-71 that were out there doing that work so at the time it was needed it was at the if you think about it really it
01:10:46 was an incredible feat of aviation for that time yeah i mean literally we have yet to
01:10:51 pass that and you also ask well is there a need to pass that i go i don't know we got stuff in space so do we need to make an
01:10:56 airplane that goes that fast i think the next one is you get into the hypersonics where you don't have to put
01:11:01 a person in it does all kinds of crazy stuff you know the work with automation all that kind of stuff
01:11:07 yeah so one of the reasons i wanted to talk to you is you happen to be one of at least in
01:11:12 my view one of the most credible witnesses in history of somebody who's  witnessed a ufo literally an
01:11:24 identified flying object and not only witnessed but got to how do you put it like chase it essentially
01:11:32 chased it so let me just lay out i think it's easier than you telling the story maybe
01:11:39 me and my dumb simpleton waste trying to explain the stories i understand it and then maybe you can correct me
01:11:46 so on  november 10 2004 the uss princeton which is one of the the
01:11:54 carriers that's cruiser it's a it's a cruiser it's a cruiser so you can't land on the  no helicopter has a
01:11:59 helicopter pad on the back gotcha and it has weapons on it okay gotcha it shoots the missiles up
01:12:04 but it has a nice radar just that incredible spy one system phased array four panels so looks in quadrants
01:12:12 perfect so they they started noticing on november 10th that there is a few objects flying
01:12:17 around at 28 000 feet with speed of  with what's i guess is considered a low speed of 120
01:12:23 miles an hour i don't know what that in knots but  out on the coast of california so and they kept detecting these objects
01:12:31 for just about a week then comes in like your part of the story which is on november 14th
01:12:43 from the i guess it's from the uss nimitz i you flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white tic-tac-shaped object
01:12:54 with no wings flying in ways you've never thought possible and in some interview somewhere you said
01:13:01 i think it was not from this world so there's a mysterious aspect to this object this entire situation  there's videos involved
01:13:13 the video of a flare forward looking infrared receiver receiver there's also a visible
01:13:20 light so you can switch yeah i mean tv mode as a tv mode so that gives you visible light and then it has
01:13:28 ir mode and  chad underwood recorded that video so and those are the videos that were
01:13:33 released by the pentagon later one of the three videos the two other videos  go fast and gimbal
01:13:44 were recorded in 2000 something 14-15  on the east coast of the united states they had different kinds of objects but
01:13:51 they were weird in the same kind of way in terms of at least the videos
01:13:58 and the experiences that people have described were similar in in the degree of weirdness
01:14:06 but  the differences is actually on the the east coast of 2014 case very few people have spoken about it and
01:14:14 even in your situation very few people have spoken about it so there's a mystery to it
01:14:21 but it's in some sense this is a quite simple story without much resolution to the mystery
01:14:30 and it's fascinating and there's a lot of opinions there's division of opinions because  it's a mysterious i mean it
01:14:37 truly is a ufo in the sense that  uap  what is it i i unidentified
01:14:47 aerial phenomena so can you maybe correct me on any of the things i've gotten wrong elaborate on some key things
01:14:53 and describe that experience in general so here's what i know so yeah we went out  on our mission to go
01:15:03 train  and they canceled the mission and they set us down there's all kinds of rumors out here there's all kinds of
01:15:08 after this has come out so originally it was the four of us there's two jets two people in each jet
01:15:13 their f-18s okay there is no video from our event it was all four sets of
01:15:19 eyeballs staring at this thing and then when we came back and told it when chad and his pilot took off that's
01:15:25 when chad got the video of it and we're like that's it that's exactly that's it and um
01:15:30 so when you say eyeballs you mean literally your eyes are seeing a thing yeah so so as we're flying out we get we
01:15:36 get vectored they come up and tell us hey we're gonna cancel training this is the uss princeton so this is the siege's cruiser
01:15:44 so we're talking to one controller who is like hey sir first you ask what ordinance we have on board and i laugh
01:15:49 because we don't carry live ordinance in training typically because batch stuff happens usually someone forgets to
01:15:54 put a switch on and then the missile comes off and hits a good airplane and it's not good so we had what's called a
01:16:00 catom9 which is really just a blue tube with the aim 9 seeker on the front of it which is
01:16:05 an ir missile so there's only two ways to get it off you can beat it off with a sledgehammer
01:16:09 you can take this thing and so you put a wrench in and it unlocks the lugs and pulls the lugs back in that
01:16:12 hold it on when it really fires the impulse from the engine actually throws the lugs
01:16:17 forward and breaks that release and it comes off down the rail that's how it works so they said hey well
01:16:24 we have real world tasking so as we're going out my wingmen the other pilot she maneuvers
01:16:31 the airplane to the left-hand side of me so she's kind of stepped up like this and i'll use your mic box
01:16:37 to start since we're going out they're calling ranges they're called bra calls bearing range in altitude and they're
01:16:41 telling us hey it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles so they're saying
01:16:49 hey 270 30 20 000. that's all i say so we got our radars we had we had mechanically scanned radars at the time
01:16:56 apg-73 good piece of gear apg-79 new one's way better but anyway and i apologize if i interrupt the story
01:17:03  hopefully it's useful but they're telling you a location of a thing that you should look at
01:17:07 yep they're telling us they have a contact on their radar they don't know what it is they just have a blip
01:17:11 they have a little blip well they've been watching these things and what he told me is
01:17:14 they had been looking at these things as we're driving i said sir we've been tracking these things for about two
01:17:18 weeks that's we had been at sea for two weeks because this is the first time we've had planes airborne we want you to go see
01:17:23 what these are gotcha so they kind of interrupt the mission to say
01:17:28 check it out so we start driving out there and  as we get down to he's going you know 20 miles 15 miles 10 miles and then you
01:17:36 get to a point where they call merge plot which means we are inside of the resolution cell of the
01:17:41 radar because radars don't see everything they're so they have a range and they have an azimuth resolution
01:17:47 right so and it's basically think of a little cube so they can and the whole sky is made of all these
01:17:52 little cubes and they're looking so if you're inside a cube with something and you're both inside the same little cube
01:17:57 then the radar can only see one thing does that make sense yeah yeah so they call merge plot when we say
01:18:02 merge plot to us it means he's right around something's around you get your head out so we're
01:18:07 not looking at radar scopes anymore and the wizards the wizards can look but everyone it's heads out
01:18:12 when they say merge plot you're done looking at your displays inside you're doing this
01:18:17 and you're trying to find it so as we look out to the right and you look high and low because he could be anywhere
01:18:22 from the surface all the way up now keep in mind the ship is like probably 60 miles away so it can't see
01:18:27 the surface and you can do your standard radar horizon calculation and go hey it's the
01:18:32 the thing is 40 feet off the water the panel can he really see you know there are radars that can see
01:18:37 around the curve but let's just say that it can't at this time so you go is it you know
01:18:42 where's it at so as we're looking around we see now this is a
01:18:49 it's a clear day there's no clouds and there's no white caps it's just a calm it's actually a perfect day if you owned
01:18:56 a sailboat it was that five to ten knots of wind and you just want to kind of go out there and you're not going to get
01:19:01 beat up and have white water coming it was the perfect date on a sailboat how many miles out do you see like seven
01:19:07 like you see just it's a clear day it's 50 it's unrestricted visibility you can see literally all the way to horizon
01:19:10 it's just clear it's nothing and we're basically off the coast if you look at a map and
01:19:15 you go san diego and then inside of mexico we're kind of in between that
01:19:21 and we're probably about by the time this all hits we're price i don't know eighty hundred i don't know
01:19:27 but somewhere out it's pretty far off the coast perfect from 20 000 feet you'd be amazed you can
01:19:32 do the calculation you can see stuff you know you'll see land 50 miles away you can see you know and when you're
01:19:36 looking at a continent it's really easy to see you're not looking at an island i mean
01:19:41 you're looking at mexico and you can see on the white gaps in the water if there is any oh yeah they're easy
01:19:47 yeah for us we look at it because we know if it's natural wind or so if it's a really white cap windy day
01:19:52 then the ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it it makes it actually easier
01:19:56 if the ship has to move where it's got a big weight because it has to make its own wind when we land which is the day
01:20:00 that it was this day you go oh okay and it creates what's called we call the verbal but when the
01:20:06 air flows across the flight deck it drops behind the ship you know and then it kicks back up so when you're
01:20:11 coming board to land it's going to make you go up a little bit and then you're going to fall and you've got to con
01:20:15 you've got to anticipate that to stand glideslope so we're pretty we're pretty conscious of what's going
01:20:21 on out there with the waves and the wind so we look there's no waves there's no wind there's no white caps
01:20:28 and we look down and we see white water so if you put if you put a piece of land a sea mount below the surface
01:20:33 like you know even 20 feet below the surface that's big enough as the waves come in you know waves have
01:20:38 height and length when they come in that's what happens on the shore when a wave comes in it hits
01:20:43 and then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up because it can't go anymore and then it breaks
01:20:48 the top and yeah and that's where you get the white so what happens is at sea when you get a
01:20:52 sea mount you'll see stuff come in the wave will crash and you'll get white water you can go out when it's high tide in
01:20:59 any one of the coasts you can go out here off of boston and go hey at low tide i can see those rocks and at high
01:21:04 tide i can't see the rocks are covered but there will be white water around those rocks you'll be able to tell
01:21:07 there's something underneath the surface does that make sense yep so that's what it was we see we
01:21:11 don't see an object because there's all kinds of oh they saw this they saw another craft below the way we didn't
01:21:16 see anything below the water we just saw white water but the white water and i like to shape it you can say
01:21:21 it was across i say it's about the size of a 737 so it looks like if you took a 737 put it about 15 20 feet below the water
01:21:28 so the waves breaking over the top and you're going to get white water where the plane is at you'd see
01:21:32 this this kind of shape so it looks like a cross so as we're looking down off the right
01:21:37 side the back seater in the other airplane jim says this is that talking in parcels
01:21:43 again he says hey skipper do you and that's about what he gets out of his mouth and i go
01:21:47 what the hell is that in a nice do you see that essentially so we see the white water and that's
01:21:51 what draws our eyes down or otherwise we'd have never seen it so we see this i would love to see the
01:21:56 look on your face when you see that and then we see this little white tic tac because we're about 20 000 feet
01:22:01 above it and it's doing it's going basically north south and then east west north and so it's abrupt
01:22:07 it's very abrupt so it's not  like a helicopter if a helicopter is going sideways
01:22:12 and it goes once it's going sideways left and it goes right what it'll do is it'll go it's got a speed
01:22:16 it slows down because there's inertia yeah and it stops and then it goes back the other way this thing's not it's like
01:22:22 left right left right with no so moving in ways that doesn't doesn't feel intuitive to you at all of
01:22:27 the things you've seen in the past so as a pilot the first thing you think is it's a helicopter
01:22:33 right right so you go oh what is because when we see it's moving we're like oh helicopter so the first thing you look for to see
01:22:39 if it's a helicopter when they're doing that because usually when they get down there towards
01:22:43 that 50 feet you'll get rotor wash you see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water it kicks the
01:22:47 water comes up besides because the downdraft you know like a thunderstorm will do that it pushes the air down and then it
01:22:53 has to come out the sides so you see it and you go well there's no there's no rotor wash what is that thing
01:22:59 so by this time we're driving around so as we're if we were at the six o'clock we're driving around towards that nine
01:23:03 o'clock position and we're just watching this thing and it's just it's still pointing north-south and it's going
01:23:07 left-right and it's kind of moving around the object and if it had if i had to say it biased itself
01:23:13 it was biased towards the bottom half so if you've got the east-west and then the north-south kind of across
01:23:18 it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out it's just kind of moving around up down left and it's
01:23:21 crossing over it it's going up just kind of so now we're like what the hell is that so then i go
01:23:28 hey i'm gonna go check it out and the other pilot says i'm gonna stay up here and i said yeah
01:23:33 stay up high because now we get we get a different perspective so she's up here and i'm down here as
01:23:38 i'm descending she can watch because right now all i'm watching is the tic tac
01:23:44 she can watch me and the tic tac so she gets a god's eye view of everything that's going on which is really
01:23:49 important you can you'll hear people say it's high cover whatever she's watching me which is it's perfect
01:23:55 as the story goes on because it it gives us two perspectives you know of a perspective that's about 8
01:24:01 when that thing disappears and they don't you know because if it's just like oh i lost it
01:24:05 and they go no it's over to the right we can still see it we all lost it at the same time
01:24:09 so as we come down we get to about 12 o'clock and i'm descending it's an easy descent i'm doing about 300 knots
01:24:14 which is a really good air speed for the airplane for maneuvering because i have i have everything available to me
01:24:19 at that speed so i'm coming down and as i get to 12 o'clock as the tic takes doing this it
01:24:24 literally it's like it's aware of us and it just goes blue and it kind of points
01:24:28 out towards the west and starts coming up so now it's obviously knows that we're there
01:24:32 whatever this thing is and knows over there so as we drive around it's coming up and i'm just coming down we're just
01:24:37 i'm just watching it now you remember this whole thing is like this is like five minutes this is not like
01:24:42 we saw it it was gone or oh i saw lights in the sky and they were gone we watched this thing on a crystal clear day
01:24:49 with four trained observers watch this thing fly around so we're like okay so i get over to the eight o'clock
01:24:55 position and i'm a little i'm a couple thousand feet above it and it's about so i'm probably at about 15k i think it is
01:25:00 i think that's my story's about 15. it's just estimating so you can see it's just really easy to
01:25:04 set because so what's 15k 15 000 feet i thought it was 8 000
01:25:10  the the other airplane ends up about yeah okay so they're still about twenty thousand feet so they're all right
01:25:16 slowly and i'm descending they're staying up there so i'm kind of doing this okay as they drive around okay so i'm
01:25:22 looking at this thing and it's about the two o'clock position we're about the eight o'clock position and i'm like oh
01:25:25 i've got i've got enough altitudes i'm gonna i'm gonna cut across the circle and i tell
01:25:30 the guy in my back seat dude i'm gonna i'm gonna do this he's like go for it skip because i was a skipper
01:25:37 so i cut across the bottom so i'm kind of almost coming out co-altitude as this thing's coming i'm gonna meet it
01:25:44 and i'm driving and  i get to probably it's i'm probably about a half mile away which you think well a half miles pretty
01:25:49 far a half mile in aviation isn't it's nothing that's i mean you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane you can
01:25:54 see all kinds of stuff at a half mile you can see pretty good detail so i'm like right there and it's coming across
01:25:59 my nose so now i'm basically pointing back towards the east so i'm cutting across because i'm going to the three o'clock
01:26:03 position it's at two o'clock and i'm gonna meet it at three o'clock so as i do this it goes it just
01:26:09 accelerates and disappears so it's this happens at around estimating about 12 000 feet so they're
01:26:13 at 20. so they've got about 8 000 foot of altitude above us when this happens and it just as it crosses our nose it
01:26:19 just it accelerates and literally in less than you know probably less than a half second it just goes and
01:26:24 it's gone and so we're like and i the first thing is dude
01:26:29 did you guys see it the other airplane's like it's gone we don't we have no idea where it's at so we kind of
01:26:34 spin around rook i go let's see what's down here and i turn around we're looking for the white water
01:26:39 we can't the white water's gone there's nothing it's literally all blue so now you go
01:26:43 and i remember telling the guy in my back seat like a dude i'm i don't know about you but i'm pretty
01:26:49 weirded out because this is i mean you know i had at the time like 30 some hundred hours of flying i'd been doing
01:26:54 it for 18 years it's nothing like anything you've seen no no so as we turn we go well let's just
01:27:00 go back you know because now i got to put on my real hat which we have to train because we're getting
01:27:04 ready to deploy to you know overseas so we got to get our training done so
01:27:09 that's my mindset especially as a ceo because i got to get i got it training out of the flight time because i'm
01:27:13 responsible to do that so hey let's go back and the the the guy who's going to be the bad guys is the
01:27:18 ceo of the marine squadron and  so cheeks is at the end he's listening to all this happen you know
01:27:23 because he's just like because he they when he first went out they were gonna do him but the little
01:27:28 hornets the legacy hornets f-18cs don't have as much gas as the super hornets so he had
01:27:32 launched first and they were going to do him and then when they knew we were off the deck they just told him hey go to
01:27:37 your cat point down south and we're going to send we'll pass this off to
01:27:43 the supermarkets what's the cap point  that's where we hold so it's called a combat air patrol
01:27:47 point so we're just going to hold at one end he's going to hold at the other end it's kind of like hey you guys are going
01:27:53 to each think if it's a football field we're going to sit on one goal line he's going to sit on the other goal line and
01:27:57 when they say go we're going to run at each other and try and do something in the middle of
01:28:00 the field and then go back to our set reset points okay so you're talking to him he's he's he's
01:28:05 listening to the he's just listening we don't talk to him at all he's just listening he just dials up because they
01:28:09 know that we all know the frequency so he's listening to what's going on because he's like because they cancel
01:28:13 training so what else is he gonna do he's just gonna hang out there and do circles while he's waiting him and his wingmen
01:28:17 so they're just they're listening to all this go on and then at this point you move on
01:28:22 yeah we come back up to train we go back as we're flying back the controller because we're talking to
01:28:26 the the kid on the princeton the  the  they're called os's they're operation specialists they're
01:28:31 the ones that run the radars and we're talking to him and he's like hey sir you're not gonna believe this
01:28:36 but that thing is at your cap it showed back up it just popped up you know this is like 60 miles away it just
01:28:41 reappears we're like oh okay so we got the radars out we're looking for it
01:28:46  we get out there we never see it we never see it again  we do what we need to do we come back
01:28:51 to the ship of course now we're like oh this is gonna be we're you know i told i told him i go
01:28:54 dude you know we're gonna catch we're gonna catch for this when we get back to the ship word's
01:28:59 gonna get out and we're just gonna catch maximum and we did yeah and it's kind of that joking you
01:29:04 know so the ship plays movies we have movies on the boat and they do 12 hours of movies so they
01:29:07 repeat because there's a day check and a night check so the same movies in the morning and night play so you never get to ever
01:29:13 get to watch a whole movie on the boat which drives my wife crazy because i'll watch stuff on tv that way too i'll be
01:29:17 like oh hey i've seen this and i'll jump into a movie in the middle and then i'll pick it up later and i'll see
01:29:22 the beginning and i'll put it all together because that's how we have to do it because we're so busy well the movies became
01:29:31 and i it was men in black aliens  independence day definitely gonna catch some oh
01:29:40 let me just ask some dumb questions so just take him because it's whatev whatever the heck you saw
01:29:45 whatever the heck happened it's you know one of the most fascinating things um
01:29:55 events in recent history so whatever it was it's interesting to talk about it different kinds of angles
01:30:01 there's no good answers but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here so first of all you mentioned see you
01:30:07 saw at some point xy and then  somebody in the princeton said you're not going to believe the sir it's
01:30:15 at your cap point that that's a different place how the heck did it know what your cap point is
01:30:20 that's a good question and that's the one if you don't no one you know you don't we don't
01:30:24 tell it it's we don't broadcast it we have a waypoint in the system but i don't know maybe it knew where we
01:30:28 were going because we used the same one day after day after day but it it obviously knew but you never
01:30:35 saw it there never saw their chad when he took off when he got the video we landed we told them hey look we just
01:30:40 we just chased this thing they're like when i go chased it and they're like why go dude and i told him i said dude get
01:30:47 video and he goes so and that's how he is he's like i'm gonna go and he he was he he was
01:30:52 determined he was gonna find this thing so when you look at his video and this is the stuff that isn't out that they don't
01:30:57 see because not all the all you see is the flare tape that's the targeting pod the
01:31:03 forward-looking infrared receiver i'll probably overlay the video when he goes out
01:31:08 it's  you know what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically two radar displays up
01:31:14 he has azimuth and range on the right one and he has the azimuth and elevation on the left one so this is called the as
01:31:19 l display and this is called this is basically the ppi which is the you're at the bottom of it
01:31:24 you're at the bottom of the square it's really taken this it's taking a cone because a radar really looks left and
01:31:30 right from a point and it squares it out so the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us
01:31:35 because they do this they square it off so so he goes out and when he first sees it he gets a radar return on it because
01:31:40 when he's not trying to lock it so the radar's just throwing energy out and getting it you know it's a doppler radar
01:31:45 so when it's in search mode that's all it's doing it's going oh i can see you i can see and it's looking for return so
01:31:50 he gets a return so he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square unless it builds a track
01:31:54 file on it but a little green square is just sitting there it's not moving because
01:31:58 it's it's sitting in one spot in space he locks it up when he goes to lock it up now he's putting a bunch of
01:32:03 energy on it but he's telling the radar stare down that line of sight and whatever's there
01:32:07 i want you to grab it and build a track file on it which will tell us how high it is how fast it is in
01:32:11 the direction that it's going okay the radar smart enough that when the signal comes back
01:32:18 if it's been messed with it will tell you it'll give you indications that i'm being jammed
01:32:22 so that's all it is is you send the signal out something it manipulates the signal either in range and velocity or
01:32:28 whatever and it sends it back and the radar was smart enough to go that is not a return that i'm expecting
01:32:34 something's messing with me i'm being jammed and it shows you and it puts strobes up it gives these lines on the
01:32:38 radar and it does some stuff so you can immediately well it does it goes full into
01:32:43 it it's being jammed in about every mode you can possibly see because everything comes up and the
01:32:47 the this aspect gets long it's all kinds i don't want to get into details but you can tell it's being jammed
01:32:52 so and as you said on rogan by the way that jamming is an act of war active jamming isn't
01:32:56 when you actively jam another platform yes it's technically an active work feels like you should be freaking out at
01:33:00 this point i mean so well he does it and then in the back seat so they don't have a stick
01:33:06 and throttle they have their side stick controller so they can control all the sensors and they can
01:33:11 just toggle around and do stuff so he can he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go
01:33:16 from that azimuth elevation on the radar to the targeting pod well as soon as he commanded the radar
01:33:21 to look at that target the targeting pod goes oh what's over there and it'll stare because it goes
01:33:25 down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked together you can decouple them but they're going
01:33:29 to automatically couple up so when he castles over he it's a switch looks like a castle switch was a castle so
01:33:35 when he moves that thing to the left and he swaps the displays out and he says instead of looking at the radar i want
01:33:40 to look at the targeting pod he sees it on the targeting pod because the targeting pods already looking there
01:33:45 and now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out he's just receiving ir energy from
01:33:51 the tic tac and then the system itself will track the pixels and the contrast differences
01:33:55 it depends on what mode you're in so it says oh and that's what those little bars you see in the video where
01:33:59 the bars come up let's do some v vision based tracking that's exactly what it is
01:34:06 so that's the video he goes through changes zooms changes the momentum he goes through all the modes so there's a narrow
01:34:12 medium and wide so wide is far away medium and then narrow and then there's the tv mode and he goes from ir
01:34:18 mode to the tv mode the cool thing with the tv mode is narrow ir mode is only medium tv mode so
01:34:26 you can actually get closer with narrow tv mode it's got a better zoom capability when you go into
01:34:31 tv mode so he goes through all those things that's when you see it going from a
01:34:35 black background to a white background he's trying to figure out what the heck is this
01:34:38 well yeah and he wants to get as much data as he can on it based on the different modes instead of just staring
01:34:43 at it going what is that thing green so that the video has been out for it it actually was on youtube for years
01:34:50 and before the government released it it was leaked at 2007. about no i got a the guy that was in my backseat
01:35:00 sent me an email and i had retired so this is about nope because i was working i was working
01:35:06 down in san diego so this is about he sends me a link to strangeland.com which is not suitable for work oh yeah
01:35:18 it's top notch yeah and he says hey i can remember the email hey skip does this look familiar
01:35:26 and i look at i'm like how the hell did that get on strangeland.com so the next thing you
01:35:31 know it ends up on youtube which was cool because you can send a youtube link to someone
01:35:38 you don't send strangeland.com to someone because you don't know what you're going to get
01:35:44 it's like googling kittens yeah so it ends up there somehow so it gets on youtube which was cool because
01:35:50 i would go out with my friends and we'd be drinking and they they go dude what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying
01:35:54 you know it's kind of like you were asking what it's like and i go oh dude i chased the ufo and they're
01:35:59 like get out and i'm like no serious so this is literally how it happened so i was sitting with my friend matt so
01:36:04 matt and i did our my he was the guy in my right seat of the a6 when i did my very first night trap
01:36:10 right and we were friends to this day right because when you do stuff like people like that
01:36:15 you know you had to have faith in him he had to have faith in me you know they're they become like your
01:36:20 brother yeah and these are guys that literally you know i don't talk to him on a regular
01:36:24 basis like chris who works at apple if if chris called me up tomorrow and said dude i need help i
01:36:30 need this i'd be like all right let's figure this out and let's do it because it's they're
01:36:33 like family you do it and most navy guys we don't we're not we don't send letters to each
01:36:38 other weekly you know i have friends that could i haven't talked to in 10 years that they
01:36:43 showed up on my door you know pop a bottle of wine grab a beer shoot the
01:36:47 take about first 10 minutes to catch up and then it's it's like old times and it's it's amazing how fast this happens
01:36:51 so incredible so i'm out to dinner with matt and i'm telling him this story and he's like
01:36:58 get out of here so he goes back and he tells our friend paco paco has fightersweep.com it's a blog site
01:37:08 so paco's obsessed like he is way into ufos yeah so paco calls me up he says dude i was
01:37:13 talking to maddie that's what we call him he goes i was talking to maddie he goes dude you got to tell me this story
01:37:20 so i'm like all right so i spend a chunk of time and so he calls me one day and i'm like i get a voicemail
01:37:27 hey give me a call so i call him up and he answers the phone but i can hear people in the background and i go hey
01:37:31 dude what's going on i go hang on hang on i gotta put you on speakerphone i go what do you put me on speakers you got
01:37:34 to tell the story i'm having a dinner party you got to tell the story so he's literally having a dinner party with his
01:37:40 cell phone in the middle of the table as i tell a tic tac store so he calls me up again he says hey i
01:37:46 got this blog and he just writes about fighter stuff like he wrote about that we call him the
01:37:50  hot break that's a guy that when you're land on a carrier comes and turns and gets ready to land really
01:37:55 fast like breaks it off right at the back of the ship and  one of the guys when we were
01:38:01 junior officers on the uss ranger one of the apartments the other squadrons guy nasty and nasty was notorious for coming
01:38:07 in in the tomcat and cranking off the  hot break right so he he he literally wrote a
01:38:12 thing about the hot break with nasty and there's another guy or mav was our 
01:38:17 one of our landing signals officers for the air wing it just it was it's just it's a good
01:38:22 article on how this was and how you know it it kind of forms you in naval aviation's kind of being kind of a
01:38:27 part of the club so he's like i gotta write about this thing i'm like what are you guys i gotta write about i go all right
01:38:31 i go because at first i would say no i'm like dude i don't want this out there just so you haven't really before then talked
01:38:36 about it much because my wife didn't even really know the whole story what just as a comment
01:38:42 is it just because you caught some no  it was just i'll tell you what three days we we had the incident
01:38:48 for about two days they played the goofy movies there there's a comic on the back of the air wing schedule
01:38:52 that they would put it was like first one was a far side and the second one was me and the guy in my back seat and it
01:38:57 was men in black but it had our names you know protecting the world protecting the nimitz battlegroup type
01:39:01 stuff it's just funny like that yeah so that was just to me it wasn't that big of a deal it was like okay that's
01:39:08 weird we're never gonna know what it was i want to get out because this is important because there's all kinds of
01:39:18 no one ever came out in suits to talk to us nobody looking like me no came out on a  no no one came out
01:39:26 of the helicopter no one came out on an airplane you know you get oh i i was told to turn over this classified what's funny is
01:39:34 all the cos and several are still in the navy  there's one that is a he i think he just finished up he was a captain of an
01:39:40 aircraft carrier you know so he'll end up making admiral and all that stuff
01:39:45 those guys are all my friends i talk to them daily just just to clarify so just for people who don't know
01:39:51 there's a story that both on the nimitz and the princeton folks in a helicopter landed
01:40:01 they showed up they took the data quote-unquote so all the sort of recordings associated
01:40:05 with this incident and they took it and presumably deleted it
01:40:14 there's a kind of story to that and then  from what i've seen you said that you believe just like we were talking about offline
01:40:21 that jokes spread faster than  or just rumors spread faster than anything on on these ships
01:40:27  that it might have been a joke that started and  well they did so here's here's the joke yeah so they had come down
01:40:35 right we had the tapes and they were chad's tapes so we use those tapes over and over
01:40:40 again you know they're they're consumable but remember i have a budget as a squadron so i have a budget so i
01:40:44 have to buy those tapes i have to all that stuff that we use i'm accountable for and the tapes are
01:40:48 actually classified secret because of the data that's on them okay so we had the tapes so the the
01:40:55 secure the intelligence guys the intel officers came down from what's called civic it's cvic which is carrier
01:41:01 intel center came down and said hey we need the tapes these guys are going to come
01:41:06 they're going to come and get them this is so we're like i'm like oh whatever you know
01:41:11 so we hand them the tapes and then someone because i have you know you know people shortly after they came and got the
01:41:17 tapes someone came to me and said you know they're they're messing with you they're playing a joke
01:41:22 so i said oh let's see how well that goes because you know i'm i'm a ceo and they're not and  so
01:41:27 i went down to civic and  it was probably he was a lieutenant or a lieutenant jg so he's
01:41:32 way junior to me and i said hey  i want my tapes back and he looks at me and i go i know you
01:41:38 guys are pulling my leg i know you there's no one came out and i go and you have about 30 seconds
01:41:43 to get me my tapes before i start tearing this place apart that's literally what i told him and i
01:41:48 said and if your boss has an issue he can come and see me because it's not going to go well
01:41:53 i said because this is and i need those tapes then he literally walked right over to a filing cabinet
01:41:57 opened it up they weren't a safe he opened up a filing cabinet and pull them out and hand them to me
01:42:02 i said and i basically said a few things to him like don't ever with me again and i left i had the tapes so this no
01:42:08 one came out there's no flying going on when all this is happening and i took the tapes back
01:42:15 and then i copied the tapes so i took two brand new eight mil tapes and i copied the sections that i want so
01:42:20 there's a rumor too that oh the original flair video is 10 minutes long and there's some one of
01:42:25 these petty officers saying i saw it that's total crap the original video is about a minute 30 seconds long what you see
01:42:31 on the release video is the entire video so you have mentioned  i apologize if i say stupid things
01:42:37 please correct me but you you have mentioned that like on rogan i think
01:42:44 that you watched it on you know on a bigger screen it felt like it was higher definition so let me ask the the question
01:42:53 is there a higher definition version do you think of the flair video that would give us more
01:42:59 pixels and more information presumably because of the because i don't know where the stuff
01:43:05 that the government released i don't know where they got okay so the stuff that was on
01:43:09 strangeland and youtube you know someone pulled off of a secret it looks like a rack you know there's
01:43:13 tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard drive and they pulled it off that
01:43:19 hard drive and they put it on youtube no it's it's just like you know anytime even a digital media the more you copy
01:43:25 digital media there's some quality that gets it degrades so this you don't know how many times
01:43:29 this has been copied so we were looking the videos i've seen are right off the original they're high eight tapes that's
01:43:34 basically pulled off the back of the display so it's not filmed with cameras it's literally a digital feed it's
01:43:37 pulled off the back and put onto a high eight tape that's how the recorders work now it's actually
01:43:42 digital to digital it's not even on tapes anymore it's it's a digital recording system but we were still in
01:43:46 that process of slowing up because originally we had little cameras here that shine so if the light hit it would
01:43:52 wash out the displays so this it's a pretty good feed when you put it on so we're instead
01:43:57 of looking at it on your tiny little computer monitor whatever i'm looking at it on a like a 19-inch
01:44:03 because it was still normal tvs back there we had just put flat screens in the ready room that i had bought
01:44:08 so we could watch movies so because a nice huge 19-inch screen it says maybe 20. it's nice wow that's huge
01:44:18 gigantic hey i can get for like 50 bucks you can get like 60 engines this is 2005. yeah
01:44:25 so so you look at this big thing and but you could see so when you get to the tv mode when i say there's little things
01:44:29 coming out of the bottom of it you could see those it was very clear but in terms of the actual
01:44:37 visual on the tic tac was it did you get much more information from the higher from the clear little things out of the bottom
01:44:44 to the bottom information so when you see it because he's coming almost co-altitude with it you can see the
01:44:48 bottom of it it looks like little you know like if you look at a cessna there's a little antennas hanging on the
01:44:52 bottom kind of like that there's two little things on the bottom there's nothing on the top there was no
01:44:56 plume no ir no no visible propulsions even heat signature you know it's all that stuff and then
01:45:02 the other thing that people didn't see is they didn't see the the radar display  which that that really raises the
01:45:09 classification level especially to see what the radar does when it's being jammed you know matter of fact when they did
01:45:15 the unofficial official investigation in about 2 i had gotten a call on my cell phone
01:45:23 from a guy who government employee and said hey told me who he was he's still in the
01:45:30 government i'm friends with him and he said hey we're going to investigate your tic tac
01:45:36 thing this is literally five years later yeah five years later and i said
01:45:41 okay whatever and he did a pretty good job i caught the unofficial official report because
01:45:48 it was really never official it wasn't but i'll give you the history of why i say that and why it never came
01:45:54 out in foia requests so he does the report he sent me the report and all he said is hey i'm going
01:45:58 to send you this report please don't distribute this report i said okay
01:46:04 the report is now out because harry reid got it to george knapp and they were good enough to redact
01:46:09 there's a few versions of it unredacted and i'm very protective of the other people that were
01:46:14 involved in this so jim has talked but he's off the grid he doesn't talk to anyone now
01:46:19 the pilot of his airplane she has come out on unidentified but they don't release her name although
01:46:23 people are starting to do it and she's had weird  happen around her house she's got
01:46:28 kids you know so i'm very protective of her and i've told people like jeremy and george if i know that the names ever
01:46:33 came from you i will never talk to you again about this and jeremy's been really good about it and so is george
01:46:39 and then but george george knew the names were because he had he got the report from senator reid
01:46:45 and then the other crew so the pilot of the airplane that took the video that chad was in if you talk to
01:46:53 that individual they really don't have the recollection they were just out flying that day and it wasn't a big deal
01:47:00 so it's it's you you need to protect because not everyone wants people knocking i don't want people knocking on
01:47:03 my door and you know and there's rumors oh you talk to everyone i think you're about
01:47:08 the 23rd person that i've talked to total yeah and that includes  you know the the newspapers and stuff and i've been
01:47:15 selective because there's so much i mean if i turn down like i turned down russian tv  i can give you her name when we're
01:47:22 done here she called she not only called me she called my wife she called my daughter she called my son and she
01:47:27 called my son-in-law because they're persistent so i'm i'm pretty protect
01:47:31 i'm very particular i mean the reason i'm talking to you is because i knew we would have a conversation that wasn't
01:47:35 based just on the tic tac in the incident but we can actually talk about some of the science and some of the
01:47:40 theoretical to get into to get more people involved to go because i think there's you know and
01:47:47 when you talk to you know lou elizondo or chris mellon you know the group at ttsa you know that that whole thing was
01:47:54 that's to the stars  academy okay that's the tom delonge group that got started so
01:48:00 and you go well  you know because i think tom has caught a lot of crap for this but he's actually
01:48:05 when you talk to him he's he's he's very smart and i asked him how'd you get into this and he goes oh
01:48:10 when i was traveling around with blink 182 he goes you read a lot of books when you're laying in a van as you're driving
01:48:15 to your next gig before you make it big and he goes and he read he was reading books and he read
01:48:20 one of them on ufos i'm trying to think the title that's one of the big ones that's out there
01:48:25 real popular and so he started just he started asking more and through his fame with blink 182
01:48:31 in the band he got more and more connected you know if you talk to chris mellon who is an
01:48:35 under secretary of defense for intelligence and he's part of the melon you know dynasty you know from
01:48:41 carnegie mellon type very very smart he knows he he he definitely knows how the government
01:48:47 works because he worked there and so when i went down to dc to talk to people he's one of the first people i'll go to
01:48:55 when i did  tucker carlson about a month ago month and a half ago
01:49:02 i asked i i he texts me i i texted him tom lu to go hey because they were like you got to do it because i turned to i
01:49:08 turned tucker down a couple times before and his  his producer had called me and i'm like
01:49:14 all right i'll do it because those guys like you gotta you gotta do this for us so from my perspective just to give you
01:49:19 some context so to me there seems to be some stigma so i come from the scientific
01:49:25 community and i really appreciate you talking to me today and i think the people who listen to
01:49:30 this include you know  faculty fellow faculty at mit and major universities and it
01:49:38 feels like there's some stigma to the subject from from the scientific community a lot of people especially when they
01:49:46 hear your story are like wow this is really interesting but you you don't even know you one
01:49:54 you're afraid to talk about it and two you don't know what the next steps are like how can we seriously
01:50:00 try to think about what you saw how to think about how we further look for things like it
01:50:09 how we develop systems and plans for how in the future we can immediately collect a lot more data and
01:50:16 try to react  properly you know to try to communicate try to
01:50:23  interpret this in in the best way possible from a scientific perspective and i i just would love to
01:50:31 remove stigma from this subject  well i think that's the first step we have done
01:50:37 in this country an absolutely terrible job with these things so you go and i joke you know go back to roswell
01:50:43 so the first reports that came out of roswell was we have this crash flying saucer that's literally what came out and then
01:50:49 magically the next day it's a weather balloon and they're showing you pieces of mylar and you go
01:50:53 well that doesn't look like what they showed us yesterday then you get into project blue book you
01:50:57 know so there's that whole series about project blue book but the bottom line of project blue book is it really did two
01:51:02 things it investigated sightings and it did everything it could to debunk and disprove to the point where it
01:51:08 actually went to discredit you know to make you look so there's always been this
01:51:14 this i don't know if you'd call it an aura around it or a mystique about ufos that if you're talking about them
01:51:18 they're nuts with ours because i'm not a i'm not a you i'm not a ufo guy i'm not a
01:51:25 junkie if you ask me do i believe that there's life outside of earth i would say you probably have a
01:51:31 better chance of winning the mega ball lottery than we're the only planet that has life on it in the universe it's just
01:51:39 the odds are against it if you do just do the math you have to accept because it if there
01:51:44 only has to be one other planet that has life on it and then i win and you lose and then
01:51:49 more and more science has shown that there's habitable planets out there that yeah everything we've learned so
01:51:55 far and we know very little but everything we've learned so far about the planets out there exoplanets
01:52:03 earth-like planets it seems that it's very likely that there's life out there intelligent life is another topic
01:52:10 but  life well we we as humans you know and even more as americans we have this hubris about us that says
01:52:19 are it and you go not so much we're not so intelligent because we are it's just how we learn so
01:52:25 you know our main mode of transportation and what people figured out you know years ago was the internal combustion
01:52:31 engine which led us to jet engines and solid rocket fuel what if you're in another planet where you didn't you
01:52:36 figured out  the ability to create a gravity field or you used you know because
01:52:42 electromagnetics are becoming bigger and bigger and bigger you know catapults on ships were steam powered and the new
01:52:48 gerald ford is electromagnetic roller coasters used to use a chain to get you to the top of the hill now they
01:52:52 shoot you with electromagnetics and you're going so there's a whole new realm of
01:52:57 propulsion that you know sometimes it's our ability to develop the technology to support theory you know we are just now proving
01:53:05 you know recently theories that einstein had where people actually joked about them and now we actually have the
01:53:09 technology to prove that gravity can bend light you know we have proven that so you look
01:53:14 at that when you go well does that mean that you know 70 years ago einstein was wrong or eight years ago einstein was wrong or
01:53:18 do you go we just didn't have the ability to look that deep into space to actually find
01:53:23 something that we could to actually measure and you know and i've seen and that's just a hundred
01:53:27 years and and the kind of things that can happen if you say look what we've done in the last 20
01:53:31 years yeah it's crazy all right let me direct because it's such an interesting topic from a career perspective from a science perspective
01:53:40 you're i mean you've spoke you've been brave in you know telling your story not some dramatic thing but just telling the
01:53:47 things you've seen did it encounter  did it impact your career is that why more people haven't come out
01:53:55 like  you've mentioned  roswell like how what advice do you give to people to the
01:54:05 community to me as a scientist for ways to go forward about this topic and still have a  you know not being
01:54:15 put in a bin in society that he's a loon or she's a loon or that person mine is to get away from the little green men just
01:54:23 divorce the two little green men and you know and i've talked to lou elizano about this
01:54:27 you know and and the group that they're working with which is incredible i mean they've got steve justice who used to
01:54:31 run skunk works where they built you know projects now louis and she mentioned was a program director
01:54:38 he ran the a-tip program at the pentagon and a-tip was a program that was tasked with investigating
01:54:45 any kind of  on ufo's uap so what's funny is the unofficial official report that i joke about
01:54:50 the guy who wrote the unofficial official report was actually an original member of atip
01:54:55 and the original stuff that atip did was foia exempt and people how do you know that i go
01:54:59 because i stood there with the memo in my hand that said these are did literally i watched the dod memo
01:55:05 that said it and it was signed so he was one so that's why the that's why i call it the unofficial official
01:55:10 report it was never it was never releasable because people go oh i put in a foil request and i
01:55:14 didn't get that i go well just because you put an effort requesting get it i go because how much how much time do you think that
01:55:19 guy is going to spend to get you the information that you requested if you can't find it
01:55:23 i actually got called by the navy i had commander in a navy call me about  right before the article came out in the
01:55:30 new york times it was this was starting to come back and she had called me because there's
01:55:34 been there was a foia request for stuff about the nimitz incident and i said do you know of anything she called me
01:55:39 she goes do you know of anything else besides the the situation reports that come off the
01:55:43 ship you know and you gotta remember when the situation report comes off the ship that's like
01:55:48 third hand so we tell someone they tell someone that person has to write it up so there's all kinds of inaccuracies in it
01:55:55 but then there's the unofficial official report that's actually pretty well written there's some errors in it but it
01:55:59 was you know i didn't help write it i just did it and he did a really good job of researching it and figuring out who's
01:56:04 who in the zoo and the players so she called me and said is there anything out there and i said
01:56:11 officially out there she said yes i said i don't know anything i knew of the unofficial official report
01:56:16 which is that one but i'm not you know if you don't know about it i'm not going to tell you because it's not my job
01:56:22 and nor did i care i mean did in that whole situation you mentioned lube i mean did you
01:56:29 think about your impact your career like just to get back to the question did do you think
01:56:34 others other pilots other thing other people like in roosevelt are thinking about this kind of thing
01:56:40 why aren't they talking about this why are people afraid to talk about this well honestly the military and the press
01:56:46 there's a distrust i'll just tell you that right now we typically don't like talking to the
01:56:51 press because if i talk to you you know especially when i do even the tv shows you know because i've been on a
01:56:56 couple shows when you look at it you know they come to my house and they film me for two hours
01:57:01 yeah and then what you see on the screen is five minutes well and yeah and the other thing with
01:57:06 the press let me give you my perspective from autonomous vehicles is the clipping happens
01:57:13 yes but also the incompetence they're not thinking i mean so so here's the thing
01:57:25 i've i have a phd and i've taken painfully too many classes from like physics and math and i also have a deep
01:57:32 curiosity about the world i read a lot that seems to be missing with journalism so you're talking to a
01:57:38 person who's not gonna push the story forward in an interesting way not the story but the
01:57:45 actual investigation of  perhaps one of the most amazing things that humans have witnessed in history
01:57:52 like you it might have been nothing who knows what you witnessed might have been from a sort of debunking perspective might
01:57:58 have been some kind of trick of mine if you and others have hallucinated something it could be some simple explanation
01:58:08 but possibly it was  something not of this world and to not do justice to this story
01:58:19 from a scientific perspective it seems at best negligence and so yeah that's true for
01:58:25 journalists it's true for others we it's just it's human nature yeah if we if we can't if we see something that we can't explain
01:58:33 then sometimes if you just yeah maybe it's just me and you let it go away and you don't think about it you know
01:58:39 maybe it'll just you know it's it's you ignore it the other side is the inquisitive mind that says well what
01:58:45 was that and i wanna i wanna dig more into it you know and if you you you look at it
01:58:51 or you're going against the norm you can get ostracized you know and if you look at you know
01:58:56 einstein's the perfect example i mean he started coming up with some of his theories some of the top physicists in the world
01:59:02 were like dude you're you're a nut job and he's he's literally proving them
01:59:07 but he didn't have you know he proved him in theory but he didn't have the means to actually
01:59:12 do the experiment to prove his theory there's a great book that i recommend people read called proving
01:59:17 einstein right by jim gates that talks about like the hard work that people try to do
01:59:24 years after to try to experimentally validate the predictions that einstein made with
01:59:31  with his theories it's fascinating but yes at the time it's kind of crazy
01:59:37 what he's saying yeah if you look at it back at the time don't we we look at it now and go well the guy was a walking
01:59:42 genius and he was but if you go back in time when he was doing it it was like what are you
01:59:47 talking about you know but one of the challenges is your eyewitness one of the challenges is you're
01:59:56 essentially an eyewitness account like we don't have good data we have very limited data of of the
02:00:03 incident that you've experienced so let me kind of dig in let me just ask some questions
02:00:10 of  maybe to see if there's just to paint more and more of the picture one you kind of mentioned so tic tac
02:00:18 shape let's break apart two situations one is the video let's look at the actual eye account the
02:00:23 the eyewitness account that you saw with your own eyes what's the what can you say about the
02:00:29 shape of the thing is there interesting aspects outside of the tic tac like is there any appendages is there um
02:00:38 some texture to it that no smooth white tic tac no we don't you don't see there's no no wings
02:00:48 no visible propulsion no windows no probes that we could see we don't notice like i said we don't see the
02:00:53 little things on the bottom of it until we see the video in the tv mode when it's zoomed in
02:00:59 right before it's shortly you kind of see them zoom in you don't see it typically on the youtube stuff that's
02:01:03 out there but remember we're looking at the original tape so there's not there's
02:01:10 basically no degradation but when you saw your eyes there's no kind of appendages no
02:01:15 no what about like somebody asked a lot of people asked you questions so i appreciate you spending your time here
02:01:20 let me ask some of them  did you i mean you chased it so we flew close to it relatively speaking was
02:01:26 there did you feel any wake like any did you feel it in any way
02:01:35 in terms of your interaction like aerodynamically no nothing nothing so 
02:01:42 another aspect of it there's an interesting thing you've developed a feel for for objects in the air did you
02:01:51 feel like it was surprised by your arrival or did it let me ask a few questions around it so
02:01:58 did you did it feel like the thing was surprised did it feel like it wanted to be seen almost to show off its capability did
02:02:10  and did it what did it feel like relative to if you were doing a an air fight against  sort of
02:02:19 like a i don't know a a foreign jet so one i think it i think it knew we were there when we
02:02:25 showed up it's just it's me  it's kind of like an animal if you've ever been around deer in a field
02:02:30 you know the deer will look up and if it sees you and you're on the other side of the field
02:02:34 it'll actually go no threat and it'll start eating you know they don't put their tail up because you move closer to
02:02:38 the deer then it goes oh it's there and i'm going to react or i'm going to move so as we were up high and it's down
02:02:44 doing whatever it was doing you know which i don't know someone asked what do you think oh maybe it was
02:02:50 communicating with something i joked on good morning america maybe it's like talking to the whales kind of like star
02:02:55 trek you know and i actually used that clip it was kind of funny but yeah we're a little human-centric
02:03:01 we think like it would it show up to talk to us but maybe he's talking to the dolphins maybe
02:03:06 it was whatever you know because it was hanging around that white water and i don't know if
02:03:09 was there something there was a seamoth we just didn't find it again i don't know but once we started the descent and it
02:03:14 actually reoriented its longitudinal axis and it started mirroring us coming up and it was
02:03:19 obviously where we were there and it was really coming up just you know you figure i'm at 20 and it's
02:03:23 coming up and it ends up getting up to 12.  where i cut across the circle i think it
02:03:29 was very aware that we were there because it interacted we call it a two-circle fight when you're fighting
02:03:33 another airplane but  you know was it was were we afraid i don't think so
02:03:42 i mean and to me it was more curious you know the curiosity overcomes any fear that you would have and i always felt to
02:03:46 be honest if i was inside the airplane  especially as long as much times i'd
02:03:53 spent inside the airplane flying and doing stuff i felt totally it was like a safe zone
02:03:59 i mean i i felt totally comfortable inside the airplane as most part you can't if you're in the airplane and you feel
02:04:04 scared it's not the job for you you have to feel that because the airplane is part of you now
02:04:09 yes you know i am inside i have the stick i have the throttles i've got my wizard in the back seat he's running all
02:04:14 the displays we are a team we're in the state-of-the-art airplane you know brand new you feel
02:04:21 pretty good and then you get something that you know can climb from the surface up and then
02:04:27 accelerate like it did like it was like no big deal you know for an airplane if you just put
02:04:31 me from a standstill let's just say slow flight just get me at 100 knots above the water and for me to you can't
02:04:38 just start a climb i'd have to lower the nose i'd have to accelerate and then i'd have to start coming up and
02:04:44 this thing just like just did it like it was like no big deal yeah you mentioned that like you kind of your reaction to it was
02:04:50  it like it's something that you would love to fly almost
02:04:56  so this object just the curiosity you experience is like like what it almost like what the heck
02:05:03 is that piece of technology and i want to fly it like what made you feel
02:05:10 like it's something that you could fly do you think it's something that a human could fly
02:05:15 like in terms of interpreting what you saw as a piece of technology because another perspective on it is it was
02:05:24  not that the thing under the water was the key thing and what you were seeing is some kind of projection or something
02:05:31 that like i don't think it was a projection i think it was a real object it was an a
02:05:35 physical hard object that would could be flied oh yeah yeah i think all four of us will say the same thing
02:05:42 it wasn't it wasn't this was not because you go okay let's just go on it's a light projection
02:05:48 well if we were both sitting next to each other we were looking at it from the exact same angle and all that and i
02:05:52 go oh okay there's a in theory you could have that but with an 8 000 foot altitude difference flying
02:05:58 you know and they're you know she's probably not directly above me she's kind of hanging out watching this whole
02:06:02 thing happen you know you're getting two different perspectives from two different
02:06:07 altitudes over a clear blue you know if you've ever been at sea and i don't mean like coastal i mean like
02:06:11 when you get out at sea the ocean is the bluest it's incredible you know you got a bright white object
02:06:19 over a deep blue ocean you got pretty high contrast and for this thing just to disappear 
02:06:26 it's it's was i'm telling you i would i mean i know we we all have the same  recollection of what happened you
02:06:34 know there's some details because it's so long ago but for the most part we know what we saw
02:06:38 and we all came back and looked at each other like what the hell was that what if i mean do you think about the
02:06:44 thing under the water that's not often talked about if there's something under the water
02:06:49 couldn't have been something gigantic like it could be what like do you ever see this
02:06:55 big ship that's why as a person so i love like swimming out into the ocean my mom's an
02:07:00 olympic swimmer so like i love that feeling but i'm also terrified when i swim because the abyss anything could be
02:07:05 under there i like there's not enough focus on that perhaps because there's no visibility
02:07:12 but is it is there anything interesting to say about the possibility there was
02:07:17 anything underneath there it could be i mean think about if you're going to hide on this planet where's
02:07:24 what's the least explored spot on the planet two-thirds of it's the ocean you there's there's there's literally i
02:07:31 mean come on the the the malaysia airplane the the triple seven it was a triple seven that
02:07:36 crashed you know they turned they didn't go where they're supposed to and they just disappeared and they've been
02:07:40 searching for it and they found pieces of it but you would think there's large
02:07:44 objects that you know when that thing hit the water depending on how it broke up there's big
02:07:48 pieces that would you'd find something they haven't found anything except what floated so to hide something underwater i
02:07:54 think would be easy so okay let's go a little bit in speculation land but
02:07:59 it's the best it's the best we can do which is the basic question of what do you think
02:08:07 was it so if you had to put money on it is it  like advanced human created technology is it alien technology is it an unknown
02:08:16 physical phenomena you know like a ball lightning for example there's a lot of fascinating
02:08:20 things that humans don't really understand is it  like i said some perception cognition
02:08:26 that led you  some kind of hallucination that made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing
02:08:33 let me put those things on the table or is it misinterpretation of some known physical phenomena like  like an ice
02:08:40 cloud or something like that what do you think it was well it's definitely i don't think it's an ice
02:08:43 cloud because ice clouds don't fly around yep and react to you do i think it was a light i'd say no because of the aspects and
02:08:52 what we looked and watched it do i'd say no what do you mean by light like a light ball
02:08:57 you know some type of perception you know there's  their experience like plasma you can do
02:09:02 plasma and you go i can see it but it's really not you know it's plasma i don't think so
02:09:08 so you would see distortions i think is it moved maybe not i mean i'm not the theoretical
02:09:12 physicist in some you know you know i'm not in mit  i would say no i mean it looked for from
02:09:20 all my experience and and i had quite a bit of it when this happened no i i think it was a it was a hard
02:09:28 object it be it was aware that we were there it reacted exactly like if i was another airplane and i had to come up and do something
02:09:34 exactly what i would do you know it mirrored me it wasn't aggressive you know there was taco it
02:09:40 fought behind us and never it was never offensive on us it never did that it just mirrored us so
02:09:45 as we're coming out it's just like you know you're you're kind of you know you said you do martial arts you know or wrestling
02:09:51 you know you see people out on the the  when they get into the ring especially with collegiate wrestling
02:09:55 because my roommate in college was a collegiate wrestler so i de facto became a wrestler because he he
02:10:01 beat me up every night yeah we joke i talk to him literally probably three four times a week
02:10:06 but you know you see wrestlers when they get out they kind of you're kind of feeling each other as you walk
02:10:11 boxers do the same thing it was doing that same thing it's like what's going on as it comes around as it comes around
02:10:15 and then it was like hey we're going to get here and when i got too close to it you know it decided i'm out of here and
02:10:21 then it did something that we've never seen the other question is what if i didn't cut across the circle what if i just
02:10:25 kept going around a circle we just keep going but i could have just watched it i mean my one regret out of
02:10:30 the whole thing is  we have a camera in our helmet in the joint helmet there's a little camera but
02:10:35 we never use it because it's nauseating to watch because you've ever put a gopro on someone's head where they're looking
02:10:39 around like this all the time it'll it'll nauseate you so we never turn that on and all you know it's the one thing i
02:10:44 didn't do is reach down and hit the switch yeah you know and then we didn't go back and because our tapes didn't have
02:10:49 anything because we didn't get it on radar because i tried to lock it up because i can move the radar with my head but i couldn't
02:10:57 it wouldn't lock the radar would lock and so so then the question is and this is
02:11:03 unanswerable but let's try did you get some hints at it do you think it's human
02:11:09 like advanced human created technology that's simply top secret that we're just not aware of or is it not something not of
02:11:18 this world so you if you'd asked me in 2004 i just said i don't know if you ask me now
02:11:34 for a technology like that you know and let's assume that it didn't have a conventional propulsion system in it
02:11:42 i would like to think that if we had a technology that would advance mankind leaps and bounds from what we normally do
02:11:48 then it would start coming out but to hide something like that for 16 years you know and i understand  you know
02:11:54 and i don't speak for the united states government i never will speak for the united states
02:11:57 government but i understand how some of that stuff works for classification levels and why we classify stuff you
02:12:00 know is it is it detrimental to national defense but there's a point where you have to
02:12:05 look and go if we had a technology like this that could literally change the way
02:12:12 mankind travels how we get things into space our ability to do things you know you talk about you know are we gonna go to
02:12:18 mars well if you have something that has the ability to go because remember these things were
02:12:21 coming down when the cruiser tracked them from above 80 000 feet which is space and they would come down and they
02:12:26 would come straight down they'd hang out at like 20 000 feet and then three or four hours later they'd go back
02:12:30 up we don't have anything that can come down hang out in once you know and i'm talking hold out in a
02:12:36 spot well we all know there's winds they're not drifting like a balloon they're just sitting there
02:12:40 and then they would go back up and they tracked up to the when i talked to the controller he's
02:12:45 like we've seen up to 10 of these things there's other guys and it was raining and all this other let's just say they
02:12:50 tracked a groups of these things coming down hanging out and going up
02:12:57 so it's not just propulsion and the way it moves it's also fuel it's everything so the whole the
02:13:03 whole of it indicates of a kind of technology that's  highly advanced but you don't think in
02:13:09 your sense that you actually don't know but you know more than
02:13:16 a lot of people in your sense the top secret military technology if you think about skunk works if you think
02:13:21 about like that cannot be more than 15 years ahead i would say for a leap like that and and
02:13:30 a perfect example in modern times is the 117. because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out like it was developed at this time
02:13:37 it flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged by the united states government what's the 117. that's
02:13:42 the stealth fighter the original stealth fighter not the b-2 but the stealth fighter so
02:13:48 you look at that you know yeah you can i think you can hide things for a while but i think a technology a leap i
02:13:53 mean this is not this is not a hey we developed this and we're kind of pushing the edge of technology
02:14:02 this is a giant leap in technology you know and the other one is do we have the basis to do that you know
02:14:07 because usually when you have a technology like that universities especially the one you're working at mit
02:14:14 a lot of the leading edge stuff is coming out of the top tier universities you know so you've got mit you've got
02:14:18 caltech you've got stanford georgia tech virginia tech carnegie mellon i'm just naming schools
02:14:25 naval post graduate school is another one there's usually indicators there's papers of hey this is where we're going
02:14:32 i don't think there's a whole bunch of papers on developing a gravity-based propulsion system that literally
02:14:39 i've got an object because how do you how much power would it cost to create a gravity field of your own
02:14:45 that could actually be strong enough to counter the giant orb that we live on so by the way you mentioned
02:14:51 gravity-based that's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms of  propulsion like what kind of propulsion
02:14:59 would have to  would have to be involved in order to result in that kind of movement
02:15:05 to me all the gravity discussions just seems insane  from a physics perspective but of course
02:15:12  it would seem insane  until it's not but because remember we only know what we know
02:15:18 yeah and and which is very little and someone has relatively is this possible at all yeah well okay
02:15:27 so this so you're you're saying that if you had to bet money all your money
02:15:34 it would be something that's alien technology so it's not human-created technology well i don't
02:15:39 like to get into little green men but i would say that i don't i don't think people development right i
02:15:43 don't think we've developed it i just you know because the other one someone had asked me they said what if
02:15:47 there wasn't maybe it was just a drone maybe it was a uav that got sent here from someplace else
02:15:55 i mean we've got stuff out there flying around so i don't i don't know i mean i'd like
02:16:02 to sit around and talk to some of the giant brains that think this stuff up i was supposed to be on a podcast with one
02:16:06 of them  but such topic which  you mean look for drones for
02:16:13 just  just space travel technology because if you look at where we're going you know because everyone talks about mars
02:16:19 you okay and you know we're hey are we gonna be able to colonize you know and i know elon is big into that you know yeah
02:16:23 what do you think about what do you think about elon spacex nasa we put humans
02:16:30 back up  back up there my theory so it's funny because i i know one of the guys that was
02:16:35 he was he was one of the original employees at spacex he's a friend of mine and i won't say his name but he knows
02:16:42 elon yeah he knows elon and  yeah and he actually worked on the entire falcon one project he's one of
02:16:46 the lead guys on that so he's got some great matter of fact he's there's a movie there's a book coming out that comes out
02:16:51 in about a year on this the original the first years of space for six years of spacex
02:16:56 you know and he's named in the book you know and they're supposed to make a movie on it so i'm like hey who's gonna
02:16:59 play it but  what he's done to me it changed the game and here's why
02:17:06 because i said you know in i think it was 62 and eisenhower warned of the industrial defense complex you know which
02:17:14 it has become everything he warned us of you know it has become and it's really driven by
02:17:20 there's the big three in defense which is really you know northrop lockheed and boeing those are the big
02:17:25 those are your biggest raytheon's kind of write like a subset of that but they're
02:17:30 raytheon's pretty big too big in u.s defense those are the big guys right that's actually where a lot of
02:17:34 military guys go when they retire they go to stuff like that so when you look at that and you go and
02:17:41 the way government contracting is working and how we charge and you know why things cost so much and
02:17:45 then you go you got elon who's got an ego you know and he doesn't like to do things certain way
02:17:52 and i've talked to the guy that worked there on you know because the government likes to have oversight of contracts where he
02:17:56 was like no just tell me what you want i'll build it i'll give you a bill when it's done and then
02:18:01 if i do it for half the price i make a ton of money because he's money-driven guy which i like capitalism at its best
02:18:09 so now you look at the two things so you got the the spacex which is the dragon capsule right and then you've got boeing so elon
02:18:19 did what boeing is contracted to do in less time for half the money and oh by the way because he can reuse
02:18:25 the boosters because they come back and land and you don't have to like morton thigh call we reused them on the space shuttle
02:18:30 but they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff because they landed in salt water and then you had to put
02:18:33 them all back together where elon gets them down because i was joking with this guy go what do they do
02:18:37 they like re rehaul you know overhaul because no actually they clean them up and they can
02:18:41 use them again they're reusable systems incredible leap in technology that no one thought of but here's a
02:18:47 private company so being able to put people on in the capsule and the spacesuits i mean it's literally like
02:18:52 sci-fi when you watch when they went up so i'm a huge fan of what he
02:18:57 and his company have been able to do because you know the fact that we were paying huge amounts of money
02:19:02 to the russian government you know and oh by the way if you didn't know because i have some friends that are astronauts
02:19:09  they all have to learn russian right they have to and they have to do it's what level five where the test is a
02:19:13 phone call yeah where they call you up and they you know because they would go
02:19:18 so i went to the pinning two two friends of mine the one actually had a mission date the one got one later so it's cool
02:19:23 when you're watching your friends doing a space walk you know because i would pull up because
02:19:27 if i knew what was going on i'd pull up the nasa thing i was in a meeting one day and i've got nasa on
02:19:32 and and makers out there floating around you know doing his stuff and i saw one he's in the space station while they're
02:19:36 doing a spacewalk so it's kind of cool when you go oh yeah i know that dude he's up there in space floating around
02:19:43 so when you when you look at what those they're capable of doing and then you go
02:19:48 what elon is bringing to the fact that now it's back in america it's actually to me it's it's cost effective for us to
02:19:58 be able to do more stuff i think it opens the door to do we go back to the moon is there a reason to go
02:20:03 back to the moon personally i think if we're gonna if they're really gonna go you know in years from now go to mars i
02:20:08 think that the moon is the stepping stone to go back to start proving some of the technology
02:20:13 to go hey we can build this we can get on the moon and now we can get back off the moon 
02:20:19 because we did this on a less than a compact computer in the 60s which is the whole reason that i flew because i'm
02:20:25 obsessed matter of fact i have the giant lego apollo at home and the lander and i have one that my dad built me in 1969
02:20:34 right after that and neil armstrong's an ohio boy and so am i matter of fact i have a picture of him
02:20:39 in a car in wapicanet ohio at the parade after he walked on the moon because his parents didn't live far from my aunt
02:20:43 uncle in wapa kineta and they were out at the parade so i've been obsessed with this since i
02:20:48 was a child do you hope to  do you think do you hope that you'll go out
02:20:55 to the space one day me if i had the opportunity i'd go in a second you know
02:21:01 i am not i mean that's one of the hopes of the commercial space flight is that you know  like people like i mean it
02:21:07 would be to us tourism but you certainly wouldn't want to in terms of you're now
02:21:13 kind of a civilian right i mean in a sense that you're just a normal person you're not a fighter pilot
02:21:19 currently but it seems like if we send a civilian up there would be somebody like you in the next like 20 years i i'd be
02:21:26 you know if elon wants to throw me one of those things i'd be all over i don't know what my wife would say but you know
02:21:29 sometimes you gotta you gotta get your kicks while you're alive i'd love to hear that discussion
02:21:33 with your wife listen there's the pros and cons  she's she's i mean i've known she's
02:21:38 on board high school so she yeah she knows how i am you know most people that know me are like yeah you're
02:21:43 pretty much the same person you were in high school you know i was a class clown and i still
02:21:46 am that way so let me ask you this question about so i'm talking to elon again soon
02:21:54 i'm curious to get your perspective on it if i wanted to talk to him about tic tac about these weird out there propulsion
02:22:06 ideas which are obviously just like you said if there's something to it if it can be investigated somehow it
02:22:12 would be extremely useful for us to understand in the effort of developing propulsion systems that can get us
02:22:20 cheaply to out to space what what should elon think about this stuff what should he do
02:22:26 what should people like him i think people need to open their aperture up and stay off of  take the next step
02:22:32 and go you know we are tied to fuels and either solid rocket or liquid
02:22:38 you know whatever we do but it's it's a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas to create thrust
02:22:44 which is really in layman's terms you know we can get into what but that's what it does if you have
02:22:50 something that you can contain that is a as a fuel source that would last
02:22:58 a significant amount of time you know those rocket boosters go and when they're done they're done there's enough
02:23:01 to get them back down and that's it there's not a huge you know not coming back and go well i
02:23:05 still got three quarters of a tank let's hold him on and do it again his system's not doing that um
02:23:13 but you know the way the way contracting especially in the government the government has tons of money but you got
02:23:16 to remember the government has to justify how they spend our tax dollars for the most part
02:23:21 there's times where they can hide money in the budget to get stuff done but then when you look at and i'm
02:23:26 just going to throw a few out there but what amazon you know does with bezos and you've got
02:23:35 elon there's some there's some big money out there yeah i mean you're talking you know
02:23:40 bezos alone could buy companies like big companies apple is another one
02:23:46 these companies had huge huge amounts of money and then just go over to the gates foundation and they've got
02:23:52 gazillions and gazillions of dollars we've got universities there's so much money out there if we
02:23:58 really wanted to do it aside from what the government wants to do because we do live in a free society
02:24:04 i think there's enough to go how do we do this and because when you work outside of what
02:24:10 the government would want to do let's so let's let's we're not working on this necessarily for the united
02:24:13 states although i am a huge giant i will be american i would never yeah i am an american
02:24:19 you're talking to somebody born in the soviet union i can't believe you agreed to this but
02:24:26 but when i you know haven't killed me yet yeah well you're here yeah and you've been here for a while
02:24:33 no no i'm joking i'm i'm an american citizen i'm actually pretty much american too when you do that so you
02:24:39 look at let's just look at american universities yes so there's some brilliant minds and we'll just use mit because you work down there
02:24:44 there's some brilliant minds but there's a huge chunk of those brilliant minds that are not american citizens so if you
02:24:49 want to get into government stuff and you are not an american citizen it gets really really
02:24:53 really hard but if i take money like bezos money elon money
02:24:59 and they let's just say they want to work together they can split it up 50 50 the two of them when the technology gets developed
02:25:06 but now i'm not constrained by who has to do the work i just want to make sure that i try and keep it in the united
02:25:10 states because technology is technology and if it gets developed and gets over to where
02:25:17 you know a country gets a hold of it and then just basically uses it for their own because you save them all the
02:25:21 research time you don't want to do that but if we can get to the point where we can we do it
02:25:25 on the international space station we realized that space was too expensive for one country to do alone so we made
02:25:31 the international space station and we have a conglomerate it's the one thing that the russians and the u.s
02:25:38 actually work together on think about it that's it we work together on space because we realize it's way too
02:25:43 expensive for us to do alone and effective so we've got this thing that's been out there floating around
02:25:48 for god now what is it like 20 years that thing's been up there floating around so it's getting old we're gonna have to
02:25:53 replace parts and do stuff but if we can pull the money together and come up with a something that would
02:25:57 literally change mankind and change travel and allow us to actually do a more effective thing of exploring
02:26:03 because if you develop that technology i'm not you don't even have to send a man person if you can develop a
02:26:07 technology that's so and with our automation and we're progressing in our
02:26:13 our computing power to send something out that's not just floating around when you know that
02:26:18 it can react a lot quicker something that could actually go down to the surface and come back up so right now
02:26:22 everything we get out of mars it goes down there and then it just sends data back it analyzes it but i've got a technology
02:26:27 that can go up there really quick i'm not worried about man i don't have life support systems and all that but it can
02:26:32 go down it can go it can cruise around it can hover above it can take samples and it can actually take martian soil
02:26:37 and then bring it back yeah so we can analyze it here that's a game changer
02:26:42 it's a complete game changer because it opens up all the planets exactly so in the sense the the the tic tac
02:26:51 is a symbol so  whatever you think even from a debunking perspective there's a non-zero probability that it's
02:26:58 alien technology and in that sense it serves as a beacon of hope and a reason
02:27:08 to like you said widen the aperture and to invest big amounts of money into thinking
02:27:13 outside the box like it's almost  a hope to say we can do better propulsion
02:27:23 we can overcome physics in an order of magnitude better way and it's worthwhile to try i think and i
02:27:28 don't think the money if you look at the big picture with the amount of money some that's out there
02:27:33 floating around these private companies you know i think if you said hey i've got let's just say a hundred million
02:27:37 dollars which really a hundred million dollars relative to bezos has got 100 and some billion
02:27:42 dollars in the network so if he said hey 100 100 million dollars you drop 100 million dollars and i go
02:27:47 and i'm gonna put a you know like the government will send a broad area announcement out that says
02:27:51 hey we're looking for this technology or a darpa program but what if i just said hey who's to
02:27:57 stop bezos and elon from doing that on their own to say hey i want to go pool universities because
02:28:01 they have fewer restrictions because it's not tax dollars they don't have the checks and bound they can do whatever
02:28:05 they want it's their money oh sorry about that to go hey i'm going to put this out and i'm going to
02:28:10 get the best physicists that are working at cern that are at mit that are at caltech at the
02:28:16 schools i mentioned and oh by the way a few of these guys are propulsion experts and i'm going to basically
02:28:23 i'm going to fund you guys for 10 years so you get 10 million a year and i'm gonna give your salaries and we're gonna
02:28:28 do that or whatever the amount works so let's cut it down to five so we can pay well right to do the research but oh by the
02:28:33 way the research is it's not classified but it's controlled so we're not gonna publicly just put
02:28:39 this out in journals but if we make a leap that we think would advance because although those let's say there's 10 of them
02:28:45 those 10 scientists come up with something and they put out a paper there might be another a number 11 at
02:28:51 another university that reads that paper and says hey i kind of had this idea and now you can
02:28:56 get a thought pool that pushes us in and gets us out of the the mindset because we have a tendency to
02:29:03 we evolve the stuff that we create but yeah it's like i was joking because you know i
02:29:09 i know a ton of guys with phds and girls and i said but you know how much when a person gets a phd in like engineering
02:29:12 how much new math is really being done i said there's a handful of people in the world
02:29:17 that are really doing i'm talking i'm talking stephen hawkins type brilliance that is going
02:29:24 i'm really doing something that's yeah that's totally different that's a big dramatic thing
02:29:29 now going on in physics that everyone is just everybody's conversed towards this local minima or
02:29:34 local maximum whatever you think about it and it's it's again same as with the tic tac thinking
02:29:41 outside the box is not is  not accepted and it probably should be
02:29:47 but it's hard because if you go back go back to einstein back to the original he was the he was
02:29:52 out of the box yeah he did not think that the true jesus had he not
02:29:57 thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories where would we be okay we're jumping around a little bit
02:30:04 so we talked a little bit about elon and mars and space but let's  let me jump back to a few questions that
02:30:11 folks had i have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because i think
02:30:17 not the actual idea not the actual facts of the debunking but the nature of the true believers
02:30:24 versus the debunkers hurts my heart a little bit because people are just talking past each other
02:30:31 but let me kind of bring it up  mick west i've just recently started to pay attention just in preparing to talk to you about
02:30:38 this world and mick west is one of the better known people who kind of makes a a career out of trying to debunk sort of
02:30:45 he's a his natural approach to all situations is that of a skeptic i think it's it's very
02:30:53 useful and powerful especially for me coming from a scientific perspective to take the approach he does it's
02:30:58 valuable and i think no matter what i think there's i hope that people
02:31:04 quote unquote true believers are a little bit more open minded to the work of mick west i think
02:31:09 it's quite useful and brilliant work so let me ask  here's a bunch of videos a bunch of
02:31:17 ideas where he kind of suggests possible other explanations of the things that were out there
02:31:24 he has some explanations of the things that you've seen in it with the tic tac like with your
02:31:28 own eyes like he says that  it's possible that you miscalculated the size and the distance of the thing
02:31:37 and so on when you were flying around i don't fight that as  i mean maybe you can comment on that person let me do
02:31:42 it right now sure so because that comes up like how how did you know it was about 40 feet long i go
02:31:50 okay so 16 years flying against other airplanes know what stuff looks like you know i've looked down on things so if i know i
02:31:57 know here's the known things i know when we saw the tic tac i was at 20 000 feet pish right around there so
02:32:03 when i look down i know what a hornet looks like looking down on him because i've done it for
02:32:08 all those years i mean i got a good idea so that's that's why i said 40 feet because it's about hornet size
02:32:13 so and as i go around you you get to the point where you have to be able to judge distance when we fly out of experience
02:32:20 and you can tell if something small or big you know so i would argue the fact of
02:32:27 you know peer experience there's you know professional observers which is what we're actually trained to do
02:32:35 and having done it for so long no it was and everyone came back with the same thing they're like yeah i was
02:32:39 about size of hornet from a human factors perspective how often in your experience of those 16 years
02:32:50 do you find that eyes what you see is the incorrect state of things so like how often do you make mistakes
02:32:59 with vision you actually you make vision issues a lot because you're and the sad part is your brain believes what your
02:33:04 eyes see we are actually trained to do the opposite of that especially when you
02:33:10 instrument fly because your brain and eyes can tell you one thing but you got to trust your
02:33:14 instruments let's let's go back to landing at night so your you're right i eyes that the runway and
02:33:22 your brain assumes that the runway is fixed but you know that the runway is moving so if i try
02:33:30 and do stuff visually i would you die every time not every time but you die close to
02:33:34 every time trying to land on a boat so we actually use instruments which are counter to your brain so
02:33:39 and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through in training they have this thing i think they still
02:33:45 use it it's called the msdd multi-spatial disorientation device or the spin and puke it looks like a giant
02:33:53 carousel and you're in these little modules and when you get out you think the thing goes really fast and they can
02:33:58 you can make yourself think that i'm descending or climbing but you're actually only going around in circles at
02:34:03 a very slow rate as fast as a human can talk but as they spin you around in a little sub thing
02:34:08 and slow it down and speed it up your body does this and you you know and then by visuals of showing you like they can
02:34:14 spin it sideways to the outside wall but they can show like lines that are they can make the line stand still
02:34:18 because they're moving the same velocity they can move the other way and you'll think you're screaming
02:34:21 you see it in amusement parks all the time you you do all that because it gives you
02:34:26 a sense of the a but you're really not doing you're sitting there so we get trained on all
02:34:30 that stuff so if you if you want to look at it and go well you're you're disoriented or this side
02:34:35 bill i'd argue going no i'm not because you know when i'm flying the airplane even as i'm looking at the tic tac i've
02:34:40 got a heads-up display that tells me what my airplane's doing so i've got i know what i'm doing i can
02:34:46 look outside i've got a sense of what i'm doing but i'm also looking inside to cross check of what i'm seeing is in reality
02:34:52 what i'm doing you actually your brain gotten good at combining almost adding extra sensory information
02:34:56 you have to you have like supervision so you're combining what you're seeing
02:35:02 and adjusting what the sensors what you're calling the instruments you're giving you
02:35:06 and that that in turn is a loop that adjusts the perception system that like that that adjusts your brain's interpretation
02:35:13 of what you're saying yeah you'd be amazed at how good so here's here's another example so if we go out
02:35:18 over the water so there's no land in sight and we're gonna fight so when we fight you know two airplanes we're gonna
02:35:26 dog fight as an instructor and i was for all most of my time you have to come back and you have to
02:35:32 recreate it so we we call it drawing arrows so you have to recreate that stuff so you get pretty good at going you know
02:35:40 like i would take off and say all right we're starting heading due east  and i know where the sun is at
02:35:47 because in the short couple minutes we're going to fight the sun's really not going to move much it's going to be
02:35:50 an irrelevance so now i know that the sun is at you know let's just say 195 degrees right so i'm starting going east and
02:35:59 it's actually be down off my right hand side so now i know as i'm fighting because in the water you don't have any reference
02:36:04 like oh i passed land i passed like no you don't and you can't use clouds because clouds do move
02:36:08 but you got to come back because you go here's where i started and then you when as soon as you end you go all right i
02:36:12 ended heading 355. and then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns and use the sun
02:36:20 relative so you can create this entire battle that went on with arrows so you can come back and debrief the guy that
02:36:24 you were teaching on exactly what happened and you get really really good at that so when you
02:36:30 come up and go well dave how do you know you were at six o'clock and he went around and he came up here i go
02:36:36 because i'm trained to do all that and i take all the notes while i'm flying you can do it and but
02:36:41 usually it's you memorize it all and you get done and then you re you as soon as you're done you knock it off you
02:36:44 look at the other airplane you get set and you start writing all your notes down yeah and you're writing it really fast
02:36:49 on your card you go out the stack of cards and you stick a new one on your knee board card so you're ready to go
02:36:53 and here's the next setup it's kind of it's in some way similar to what  like at the at the
02:37:01 highest level chess players do i mean you're i mean they they they recap the games but the
02:37:11 the richness of the representation that they use and remembering like how the games evolved
02:37:18 it's not like it's much richer than the actual moves it's like these a bunch of patterns that
02:37:23 are hard to put into words like like all the richness of thinking they have about the way the game evolved
02:37:30 it's more like instinctual from years and years of experience so they try to put it into words but
02:37:37 they really can't it's it's just not i understand that it's because for us
02:37:41 if we don't come back with anything then there's no learning to be had right because the whole thing is
02:37:46 the debrief when we get back and we talk about that's really where the learning is and it's the same thing if you want
02:37:51 to go back to chess you know when you start off you try and learn because you're
02:37:55 remembering what you're doing if you play against someone i'm always a big place play with someone better than you that's
02:37:59 how you learn if you're constantly beating people you're not learning anything you're just learning that
02:38:03 they're not good and you're better when you when you challenge yourself against someone that is going to
02:38:10 is better than you you learn so i learned how to fight an airplane with he's actually one of my best friends
02:38:17  we'll call him tom i won't give his call sign because i don't know he wasn't so tom took me out and taught me how to
02:38:22 fight  because tom had just left hopkins he was the the training officer top gun which so
02:38:28 that's the guy yeah the training officer is the main guy at top gun so tom was a training officer top gun so
02:38:34 tom when i learned because i come out of a6 and we really don't fight because it was a bomber
02:38:39 so i get in f-18s and i want to learn how to fight because it's a whole other side of the mission it's the f and f
02:38:43 fighter attack the f a-18 is fighter attack so i had to learn how to fight so now i got
02:38:48 one of the best fighter pilots in the world who's going to teach me how to do it and he did and i would
02:38:54 do something and then he would go i'd get to a situation where i had never been and then i would go well i'm gonna
02:38:59 do this and then he would destroy me and he would come back and go here's why you don't do that and then i would take that
02:39:05 knowledge and i would put it in my little basket of tricks and over time because you know no one
02:39:10 walks out into that world i don't care how gifted of an aviator and go i i am the man yeah or the woman i'm it yeah
02:39:18 no it's a learning process and so over all those years you've gotten good so i mean so
02:39:25 what are the chances that your eyes betrayed you when you saw the tic-tac
02:39:34 low zero well i mean i'm not zero so okay yeah i am 99.9 so 0.1 my eyes deceive me but remember
02:39:43 if it deceived me it had to deceive the other four people so the percentage is even lower
02:39:48 yeah okay well i i don't find that that particular debunking case that you saw but i'm glad you put it
02:39:54 you you said those words out loud so for me from my perspective  coming into this world and looking at it
02:40:03 i'm a little bit more skeptical  so your eye account i think is the most fascinating story
02:40:08 and that  i think  that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of
02:40:17 on so many levels just like we said on the engineering level that maybe there's propulsion systems
02:40:22 we can actually build that can do some crazy amazing stuff so it's a at the very least intriguing
02:40:30 and at the best inspiring i just want to say that but on the video side it's like
02:40:39 it's  the videos for the fleur video the go fast and the gimbal video they are only
02:40:50 interesting to me to me in the context of your story like without that they're kind of low resolution
02:40:59 it's like it it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical so it's just where i'm coming from maybe you can convince
02:41:05 me otherwise but so to bring up mick west one more time he looks at the flair video and he says that
02:41:14 one of the most amazing video parts of the flare video for people who haven't seen it
02:41:21 is at the end of it  the the the tic-tac flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left
02:41:31 off the screen off the screen and what midwest says is  that it you know midwest probably others
02:41:40 that the way to explain that is the tracking system like we said this vision based tracking
02:41:48 simply loses the like the object the tracking loses it and so it simply allows the object to 
02:41:56 float off screen because it's no longer tracking it so i find that at least a plausible explanation
02:42:05 of that video looking at your face you do not so can you maybe comment to that  to that debunking  sure
02:42:15 so it's funny how people can extrapolate stuff who've never operated the system no
02:42:20 for sure and that's like me going because i'm a big formula one fan you know that's like me going oh my god
02:42:25 louis what were you doing you could have done this with the car and you need to won the race right you know and lewis
02:42:29 hamilton right now is you know defending world champion two time he's four-time four-five-time world
02:42:33 champion but that would be pretty stupid to me to try and tell lewis hamilton how to drive
02:42:37 a car yeah or a matter of fact anyone driving a formula one car so i i
02:42:44 can't tell you how many times i've watched you gotta remember when we looked at this thing
02:42:48 when when chad came back with the video we sat there and watched it i mean i can't tell you how many times i've
02:42:52 watched it off the original tapes going all right right all right let's look at this you know because you can look and see
02:42:58 where the you can see where the airplane is going you can see if it's looking left or right and if you actually watch
02:43:02 all that stuff it doesn't do that it actually when the vehicle starts to move the bars the tracking gate starts to open up and
02:43:08 the people at raytheon could probably add to this because they built the pod the tracking gate will start to open up
02:43:14 and and but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen the pod can't move fast enough it has
02:43:19 gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around because there's another theory that
02:43:23 oh with the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane so if i'm looking at you and you pass
02:43:26 underneath me as does this the ball will actually flip around to kind of finish off
02:43:32 and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it has you know it's a gimbal it can't just it's not free-floating um
02:43:39 but there's a theory on one of them oh it's here and it flipped over it doesn't do that when it's looking out in front
02:43:42 it stays like this so that yet another another debunker who doesn't know this so
02:43:47 you know and mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos like one of them the go fast as a bird
02:43:54 and jeremy corbell actually did a nice job of saying no it's not because he's on he's on black hot so the the
02:44:00 white object is actually colder than the ocean that's flying well birds aren't colder than the ocean they'd be dead
02:44:09 so the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation the apparent rotation of the
02:44:15 object that is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of
02:44:25 and make west suggests that  flare like reflections or whatever can explain no because what
02:44:33 mick west doesn't see is so when they take because i've talked to the one of them
02:44:38 actually i work with so i know him i know i talk to him all the time so  and it's his best friend actually
02:44:44 shot the video one of his best friends for the giveaway video the game both of them
02:44:49 the go fast and the gimbal were shot by the same person okay so  and they were in each other's
02:44:54 wedding so that's how well they know each other okay so what you don't see is
02:45:00 so the airplanes that are flying still super hornets but they have the apg-79 which is the new
02:45:05 phased array radar that's made by raytheon things incredible okay it doesn't usually if it's if it's out
02:45:11 there and it sees it it's real so at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff
02:45:14 and then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there well the targeting pod there's a heat
02:45:18 signature and you go hey dot heat signature something's there it's real it's not you're not picking up
02:45:23 some extraneous things so what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go holy
02:45:27  look at that thing it's just sitting there and it's in the wind and it's going against the wind
02:45:32 why it's doing this you know someone goes oh it's an airplane now if an airplane does this it's eventually going
02:45:36 to start to change aspect because it's in a turn this thing doesn't change aspect it just
02:45:40 rotates right the other thing that you see when you talk to them is so they're on their radar
02:45:47 there's an object that they identify as their number one priority or their launch and steering
02:45:53 so when they designate that that's where the targeting pod is going to look that's what you get in the gimbal video
02:45:58 there's five other i think it's five they're kind of in a v you know like a geese would fly
02:46:02 that are out in front of it and they're actually coming they're out in front of it and they actually turn
02:46:06 on the radar and go the other way while they're filming the gimbal video which it's i know  ryan has come out
02:46:14 and talked about it but when you see it you go you know if you take it in context because you go oh
02:46:20 it's just the video well if you take the video with the radar going no there's actually other
02:46:23 things out there because there's at least 60 people that have seen these things on radar
02:46:29 off the vacates it was it actually became i called a buddy mike who was running the wing at the time the fighter wing
02:46:35 i said what are you guys doing about this he goes well we got to know tam out which is a notice to airmen which means
02:46:40 there's these objects out there in the warning area so anyone can you can fly a cessna through the warning
02:46:45 area it's all the warning area tells you that there's high military traffic and training out
02:46:48 here it's probably best not to be here but there's nothing that prohibits you from going in there
02:46:53 so these things have the right wherever they're from or whatever they are you know because people are like oh
02:46:59 they're balloons well balloons float balloons don't sit in in in 70 knots of wind and stay in the same location they
02:47:03 don't say they had an airplane because there was two there's the gimbal thing that's a
02:47:07 pretty big object there's also they talk about it looks like a cube that's inside of a sphere a
02:47:12 translucent sphere what's that transparent how is that and so i've heard they almost hit one it's almost hit
02:47:18 hit them so that's another that's one of the biggest another biggest account it's like almost
02:47:23 hit a plane   something that appeared to be a cube in a translucent sphere what do you
02:47:33 again you know what i mean that that's that's the most dangerous you're right the biggest frustration is when
02:47:38 you do that you go okay so this thing passed between two airplanes and it was i think it was in
02:47:43 like 100 feet or something like that of the airplane that almost hit it so they do is they come
02:47:48 back and go hey i had a near midair what do you have in your mid-air with this floating beach ball with this cube
02:47:53 inside of it and you go huh you know so they send out a no tam again and they they do a what's called a
02:47:58 hazard report that says hey there's these objects out there we almost hit one you know and that gets sent off to the
02:48:03 naval safety center what was done i mean what are you going to do you can you know catch one go out
02:48:10 with a giant net and try and bag one you don't know because they've seen them they've picked them up like hovering on
02:48:14 radar and then all of a sudden they're traveling at really high rates of speed so you know what i'm gonna do what yeah
02:48:19 what are you gonna do well and that let me ask this because this is what people kind of
02:48:25 think about after you witnessed tic tac and after this these incidents as far as we know
02:48:33  with the gimbal and the go fast it seems like people in the military did not did not react like what like did not
02:48:42 freak out it almost like was a like a mundane event how do you explain that why didn't the
02:48:49 people on the ship not the higher-ups why did wasn't there a big freak out or
02:48:56 as some people suggest the higher-ups knew about it all along and just we're not letting
02:49:00 everyone know that there's some kind of secret military   you know it's like
02:49:07 like tests yeah so let's talk about so let's say you've got this cool new toy which you call it a cool new toy you
02:49:13 typically don't take your cool new toy out into an area where the cool new toy could get damaged or
02:49:18 what if the airplane would have actually hit your cool new toy and you got two people that are ejecting or dead and you
02:49:22 got a you know 80 million airplane that's now in the bottom of the atlantic
02:49:29 you know tests are normally done in controlled environments just it's like any test a
02:49:32 lab test or whatever when you take things out into the real world you know you're still going to test it
02:49:38 in an area where something goes wrong so when they started and we'll go back to elon so my friend that worked there
02:49:44 they had a rocket go off they were out in kwajalein and when the rocket went up a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and
02:49:51 it ran out of fuel before it got all the way up and it came falling back down well when you're out on an atoll in the
02:49:57 pacific if it's going up above you the worst case is going to land on you so you're worried about where else is it
02:50:02 going to land and it actually crashed next to the atoll and and you know elon wasn't happy and threw
02:50:08 this guy under the bus so that's a test environment because you don't know what's going to happen so
02:50:14 because someone said well when we chased the tic tac well it could have been some secret government thing well secret
02:50:18 government things typically just don't come out and test to where unknowing pilots you can't control
02:50:25 a lot of things you're exactly right so you go you know it's you know it's not the doctor evil
02:50:30 scientist that's going to throw out there to get there's control and there's reasons that we do it
02:50:36 because a lot of stuff especially when you get to there's there's you build something in theory you model it
02:50:42 you go hey this is it looks like it's going to work you get funding you build it you test it some more you bench test it
02:50:48 you know you like an airplane with digital flight controls before it even leaves the ground
02:50:53 they've got things over the pedostatic system that are changing the what the airplane thinks is the airspeed
02:50:58 talking to it and it's probably up on jack so the gear up so it doesn't it thinks it's flying it
02:51:03 doesn't know it's sitting on jack stands and they're just changing the pressure on the pedostatic system so
02:51:08 they can actually make the flight controls move and they can get all the data back to go
02:51:12 hey it looks like it's going to work and then there's when there's a bunch of stuff that they do
02:51:16 that's a control environment which you can do the testing yeah throwing out in the middle of
02:51:22 where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous thing that i've heard is it possible yes is it more
02:51:31 really is it is it is it more likely it's more likely they're not doing that yeah and the
02:51:36 other the other side of that question is why do you think people on the nimitz
02:51:41 and in the us government in general not freak out more at the incredible thing that you've seen
02:51:47 freak out in a positive way freak out in the negative way like what are the russians up to again
02:51:51 or or more like what is this like so more turmoil so if you to put a chinese flag on the
02:52:00 side of it or a russian flag on the side of it i said yeah it had a big russian flag on the side of it dude
02:52:04 then it would have got a lot of attention it would have went high order yeah right if it was
02:52:08 you don't have to say russia or China  just say if there was another country's emblem on the side of this thing that we saw
02:52:15 and said oh it belonged to them then it's a big deal so here's what's going on so we're
02:52:20 literally in the middle of workups and it was a joint workup normally they we go out for a month go come back do stuff
02:52:25 go out for a month this was a two month at sea period where we actually had to beg for them to
02:52:28 let us when the ship pulled in at thanksgiving so we could run home up to the central valley have thanksgiving
02:52:32 with our family and then run back down and do this okay so you know and i had just taken over i
02:52:40 had the squadron for a month right so i'm a a brand new ceo i'm the most junior guy
02:52:45 on the as as far as the commanding officer goes for time in the navy and actually at the
02:52:51 time i think it was the most junior ceo for o5 command in the navy right so you go okay so i'm out here i got my
02:52:59 squadron i'm running it i see this thing you know we catch for it i have a squadron to run i have the
02:53:04 the the tic tac was over here and although an extraordinary event i have 17 air crew and 300 sailors that
02:53:12 i'm responsible for right their well-being making sure they're fed making sure they're happy
02:53:17 they're birthing you know and i'm working with my master chief and i'm working with my exo
02:53:22 snap and and we're going through all this stuff i don't have a lot of time to worry
02:53:27 about the tic tac yeah if people need to talk to me so you got to remember
02:53:32 you got the captain of the ship you got the airwing commander and you got the admiral those are the
02:53:37 top three and you got the ceo of the the princeton who is a major command guy and that's really your big major command
02:53:42 and then everything else is you got all the squadrons with your o5 command and you got the small boys that are out
02:53:47 there which is 05 commands so in the hierarchy as far as rank and responsibility of what's going on
02:53:54 i'm pretty much in the top 20 with all my peers and then i've got obviously the captain  and the admiral right and
02:54:00 then he's got some post-command guys on his staff that we were friends with i thought you were
02:54:04 responsible for a lot of things yes oh yeah this schedule yeah there's missions you have to do a lot get the job done
02:54:12 and there's no time for silly things that's exactly right so and we're the
02:54:18 we're the integration you know when when a battle group deploys especially when you go to the middle east for what we
02:54:22 were doing the air power is the key it's we take our airport with us we can park it anywhere
02:54:29 we want and we can do what we need to do so we're kind of key players so when you get the theory that oh all these men in
02:54:34 suits showed up so the captain of the ship never said anything to me the admiral never saying
02:54:38 to and the people on his staff that i was friends with never saying to me the other ceos that i talk to on a daily
02:54:43 basis never said anything to me and no one ever came and talked to me and i'm the guy that chased it so
02:54:47 in all the theories and all the debunkers and all the stories because i don't know if people think they're gonna
02:54:50 get rich on this because i made a big donut on this i can tell you what i got paid for i got
02:54:55 paid to go out and spend 21 hours of my day going to la and do a five-minute talk for someone and i'm like
02:54:59 and it wasn't for the talk because i'll talk for free because you're not paying me i said i said and then i got paid to go
02:55:06 to the mcminnville fest because they my wife and i got to go because it was just look like fun because the whole
02:55:10 town gets involved yeah and it's the only time i've ever spoken publicly in front of a large audience
02:55:15 about this because it was just you know it was fun and i got asked and jeremy and george napping went the year
02:55:20 before so i went with with bob lazar so i got to hang out with bob and his wife and his wife and my wife and
02:55:25 you know we all hung out kind of you know talking not about ufo stuff but just getting to know each other as people
02:55:32 because you know bob's like me the stuff that he talks about is not the center of his life if anything it ruined his life
02:55:38 you know he's just a really really smart guy that's just like the rest of us trying to get through life yeah that's
02:55:45 nevertheless i mean that was one of the sad things reading  louis lozando's resignation
02:55:54 note from his   he was the program director at the  atip program like alright yeah
02:56:01 one of the sad things is that he's mentioned that you know people in government just don't take this
02:56:07 seriously as a threat like ufos as a threat like you said if it doesn't have a russian label on it
02:56:14 it's a it's a sad thing to think about that that we have such a busy schedule that the anomaly it doesn't
02:56:24 is a distraction that we don't want to deal with and it kind of just fades into history like literally
02:56:32 it's kind of sad to think that if aliens like and  it just didn't it because they're not
02:56:42 like when aliens show up they're not going to be a thing that's on the schedule and if they
02:56:49 don't start killing people they just kind of show up in some very  nonchalant peaceful way
02:56:58 briefly people would be like that's that that's  i don't have time for this
02:57:04 that's so sad it's like anywhere in the world so you know go back let's go back way back
02:57:11 way back in the time machine you know there were people kind of scattered around the globe
02:57:15 you know in europe's a perfect example why does france speak french and then right next to them spanish you
02:57:22 know spain speaks spanish and then you kind of jump over and germans or german and
02:57:27 the polish people everyone speaks a different language because if you look at the way the terrain kind of subdivide
02:57:31 the original people that were there you know thousands of years ago
02:57:37 they speak differently right you'd be like the us but see the us is different we all speak english because what
02:57:42 happened we came over and we started on the east coast and we migrated west we won't get into
02:57:47 the you know what happened and you know because the native americans all spoke different languages yeah
02:57:52 you know it's that same type of thing so but anytime we have a tendency to show up you're you're actually you think about
02:57:58 you're an alien if i go to a different area if i just you know go back 500 years where you
02:58:03 know or a thousand years where travel we weren't traveling across oceans at the time we were well we don't think we were
02:58:08 the vikings probably were because we had limited you know we had to have supplies and the boats
02:58:13 weren't as big we had to build them by hand we didn't have power tools and all that stuff so you know
02:58:17 if you show up someplace like when the conquistadors from spain came over into south america and you've got
02:58:24 you know the natives you're actually an alien you know and then you look at what typically happens when aliens show up
02:58:30 in in a human alien world you know and when i say alien i mean you are not from that area
02:58:36 the other we we take what we want and that's what happened i mean we literally
02:58:43 defuncted civilizations because that's how we are you know humans are we're an interesting group
02:58:50 so you go now what what if something is from someplace else just let's just let's just go off the grid and go ah
02:58:57 let's say there are little green men yeah what are their intentions lou asked me this when we were
02:59:00 talking to lou alezando and he said what do you think they were here for us i don't know
02:59:04 he goes what i go hello they were observing they'd come down they'd hang out he goes
02:59:07 what if they were prepping the battlefield what if they were observing to figure out what we do
02:59:13 and you go that's interesting the other theory is maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here and they just
02:59:17 check in on us because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilization
02:59:23 that's inferior to them actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or above
02:59:28 because now these they become the threatened type so you watch us grow until we start getting too much
02:59:33 you know it's kind of like you go well because they always have a tendency to hang out around nuclear
02:59:37 right and you go well you know they're if this is an advanced civilization i'm gonna go science fiction kind of comical
02:59:41 they come down and watch us and go look at the the the crazy upright monkeys now have
02:59:46 developed the atom bomb let's hope they don't destroy themselves yeah if i was an alien civilization i would start
02:59:51 paying attention with the atom bomb that's why the i mean there's certainly an uptick of 
03:00:00 what is it ufo sightings since since the nuclear since the nuclear era yeah that's you go um
03:00:09 let me ask a little bit out there question maybe it's a speculation but maybe touching on roswell
03:00:20 do you think it's possible that there is out of this world aircraft or beings that are in the possession of
03:00:31 one of the governments on this earth like the us government is it possible so the one perspective of that
03:00:39 if it's possible is it possible to keep a secret like that i would say this i think it's very it's
03:00:43 highly possible because if you go if you just look at all the sightings and let's go
03:00:49 just look at project blue book oh it was what forget how many thousands of sightings and there's a percentage it's
03:00:54 like 10 or 15 percent they still can't explain like our tic tac is one of them you know they
03:00:58 basically the government has come out and said we don't know what that was okay so so if you go okay of that
03:01:04 fifteen percent that we don't know and of these thousands they're still that 15 makes up a pretty big number
03:01:09 what are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere on the globe and was recovered and i don't care if
03:01:15 it's a intact system or you got pieces of it of a metal that we can't explain
03:01:24 or some some biological matter to say the least it could be intact or it couldn't but
03:01:30 the the odds of that now are starting to go down that you know that could never happen and i'm
03:01:34 not talking just the united states i'm talking the world globally so is there a chance that a foreign government actually
03:01:40 possesses or our government or someone in the in the world on the globe of the seven plus billion people
03:01:46 has something that is not from this world and i'm not talking to meteor but something that was
03:01:52 manufactured in some way that allowed transport or observation it could be a drone could be a foreign drone you know like voyager
03:01:58 flies around and does all that stuff and we got stuff that just went past pluto that's out in the kuiper belt
03:02:03 you know there's there's stuff out there floating around and what about ours it's going to crash into jupiter eventually
03:02:07 or whatever because we've had stuff crashing the planets so if that's the case
03:02:13 you would think something is out there that we have something that we can't explain and according to
03:02:18 lou there's stuff that we can't explain you know and i would assume that lou who ran atip has has seen stuff that he
03:02:24 can't openly talk about because you know because i had a clearance when you have a clearance
03:02:30 you were you sign your name you're bound to that and to me that's an important oath that you hold to you know this is kind
03:02:36 of where  you know people have issues with bob so if you know and i leave it to you to
03:02:42 determine if you believe bob or not i'll tell you bob is a straightforward very sane normal super smart guy bob
03:02:50 sorry yeah yes there is the other side that says well should he have come out and talked you
03:02:55 know to those who owe clearance who you know are true to the government you would say he should have never spoke he
03:03:01 he was under an oath to not say anything but he did if you asked bob why did you say
03:03:05 something his the his answer was i understand there's an oath but
03:03:11 i felt that the technology could benefit all of mankind and it shouldn't be locked away
03:03:15 and i'll leave if you believe bob that's that's kind of what bob says and that that's such a interesting key point
03:03:24 if there is aircraft a technology that's in the possession of the say the us government should they make
03:03:30 that publicly known this is the snowden question this is the question of like
03:03:36 do we release stuff that can potentially change the nature of human civilization like the the way we the way we think about our
03:03:44 place in the world also the if that technology is potentially useful for military applications
03:03:55 the nature of military conflict should we release that information or not if you were the government so here well
03:04:00 here's exactly how so for for classified information the government is the people that classify it
03:04:07 so i can't go i can't look at something and go oh my god this avion bottle is now top secret i
03:04:11 can't i don't have the authority the ability or anyone to do that that's the guard that's up to the government i
03:04:15 agree with that because i worked for the government for 24 years of my life so
03:04:22 i understand that but now you go there's reason stuff is classified okay and it has to do with
03:04:29  sometimes information is classified by how it was obtained it's just like the mob if i have a spy
03:04:35 and i'm a mobster and you're the counter mobster but i have a guy on the inside that's feeding me information
03:04:40 i can't do it and a perfect example is if you've ever seen the  it's the tom cruise movie what is it air
03:04:46 america or whatever but he he plays the guy in louisiana who was hauling drugs for pablo escobar
03:04:52 and he ended up getting a cargo plane and the government the cia was kind of funding him to do stuff
03:04:57 that's how he got hooked up with pablo but they put cameras on his airplane and when reagan had come out and said here's
03:05:01 pictures we have proof that they're running these drugs it didn't take pablo long to figure out
03:05:06 those pictures were taken from inside of the plane of this guy he had been working with and that guy ends up dead
03:05:11 does that make sense so you classify to protect the source you classify to protect the technology
03:05:17 because if the technology would get out it could be grave damage or there's levels depending
03:05:21 on if it's a secret or top secret there are levels of damage that can be done to the u.s government and our
03:05:26 well-being as a country and we owe it to this because we're all americans you know to me
03:05:32 no matter what some people will say even in this country this is the greatest country on the planet
03:05:36 this is the only country that you have the ability to do what you want to do it's just don't be lazy
03:05:41 and i have stories of people that came over here and started with nothing and they're they're living the american
03:05:48 dream and they'll tell you and they didn't get it because of you know like you
03:05:54 you came over here from russia you get no minority status or anything else you get you're a white anglo-saxon protestant whatever
03:06:03 you're religious you're over you but you come over here i kind of knew that from the last time but
03:06:09 but you come over here you basically have made yourself you're educated you're working at
03:06:13 literally the top research university in the world to be honest i can do whatever the hell i can
03:06:20 create and with a bit of with a lot of hard work i can do quite a
03:06:26 and no one gave it to you yeah so i mean i'm a believer that like i mean we are  a community so like
03:06:35 there is a social aspect to it but the freedom and the american dream is a real thing and that this is this i
03:06:41 you know i joke about being russian but i i'm an american and this is i do believe the greatest country on
03:06:47 earth so there's a reason the nationalist pride  the pride in your nation is a powerful thing and
03:06:56 around that this secrecy holds value but to me alien technology is bigger than that i mean it's
03:07:08 it's not so much a threat as a you're holding back something that could inspire the world
03:07:15 like human knowledge so let's talk in theory so i'm gonna go back to bob because i've
03:07:20 talked about so bob is a propulsion guy right right bob has a bicycle with a
03:07:27 rocket motor he built the rocket car you know so he did that so if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system
03:07:34 let's just say this is i'm just talking this is dave's theory i am i own i have i have custody of this
03:07:43 thing from a technology that i don't understand and i know it's a propulsion system so now i gotta figure it out
03:07:51 right so who are you gonna go to right you go find someone so you go wait here's a guy who at the time was working
03:07:58 at los alamos which they have proven who is big into propulsion he designs all this he builds a in his garage
03:08:05 hey he's super smart why don't we bring him in so you hire him on a contract and you go
03:08:09 hey we're going to brief you into a program and he goes and works on wherever he says he worked you know
03:08:13 that's not important but you get access to the technology to try and figure it out and then you go well you know bob comes
03:08:18 out and says you know like we're figuring out these things but there's a part where our technology
03:08:22 isn't advanced enough for us to figure the whole thing out so then you know and let's just say bob
03:08:28 doesn't come out and tell anyone he he works on it until he gets to the point where he's stagnated
03:08:35 he he said he's in a wall you go i can't do it so sometimes the best thing is to bring in a fresh mind so you go find
03:08:39 someone else who's in a propulsion you bring them and they work they can't figure it out or they get to
03:08:43 the point where kind of back to the einstein theory where hey i've got all these theories on how it works but we
03:08:47 don't have the technology we haven't advanced enough to actually do what we need to do we still
03:08:51 have to advance technology more so then what do you do you shelve it you go hey good
03:08:55 project's over and the contract you shelf it and you wait another 10 years and you wait another 10 years until
03:09:02 technology and our abilities and our our research advances more and then you go find new people to bring in that are
03:09:07 experts in that field and go hey we want you to work on this thing and here's what we know about it so far
03:09:11 or you don't tell them anything because because remember if you if you reveal someone else's research
03:09:17 you can taint their beliefs they'll start to sway in that direction so you go i'm not going to tell you anything i'm
03:09:22 going to give you this thing and now you tell me what you think and as they progress if they get stuck
03:09:26 on a problem that maybe bob and someone else solved earlier you can go hey what about this you don't have to tell where
03:09:29 it came from what about this and now they can leapfrog and they get another two steps
03:09:35 closer to the final answer and then we get stuck by our evolution of technology do you shelve it again
03:09:40 do you think that's the right way to do it because it's heartbreaking i don't listen i love government but
03:09:48 we just had this discussion about elon and so on the the alternative approach is to
03:09:55 release this to the world and say there's a mystery here and then the elons of the world the jeff
03:10:00 bezos who talked about money but it's also not just money it's like this engine that's within we talked
03:10:08 about the american dream to say i'm gonna be the one that cracks this mystery open
03:10:13 and like that's within a lot of us and like money aside people in their garage just will but
03:10:19 you're thinking like a scientist now let me now let's shift to let me think like a country so we have country
03:10:24 a b and c and you can look at the nuclear arms race so we know that germany was really close
03:10:30 we know that russia was getting pretty close we just won the race and we were the first ones with
03:10:35 it yeah and still to the state germany could have won they could have won they could have won
03:10:40 but someone was smart enough to not finish the equation when they knew they had the answer
03:10:44 it's literally what it comes down to someone was smart enough to realize that that that got into the hands of the nazis
03:10:51 that it would be the end and and that's that's a tough call to do that knowing that you have the answer and you
03:10:57 can't solve the problem because it will go into the wrong hand and that's kind of the fear when you look at this you go
03:11:03 okay so if we do this if we put it out there we've got this technology if we don't work on it kind of
03:11:08 international space station like we're all going to work on it together in  you know like antarctica is really
03:11:14 supposed to be treaty free from any weapons or anything we're supposed to we got the
03:11:18 international thing down there we're all going to work together if you did it in the confines of that
03:11:23 and you could control the flow in and out because what you don't want is the someone stealing information and getting
03:11:27 it back to where and countries are notorious to do this hey we're doing internationally
03:11:32 but we're secretly doing it ourselves to see who can come up with a solution first that's the problem because we have this
03:11:39 inherent thing of power and technology like that is power it would literally change the game of
03:11:45 the way the world operates and from not just a transportation or mankind but from a military aspect
03:11:53 it's got huge huge  yeah yeah i guess so beautifully beautifully presented
03:11:58 and there's i feel like there's a tension between those two places the scientists view the world
03:12:04 and the national security view of the world let me let me get to this kind of interesting point which is
03:12:12 a lot of conspiracy theorists kind of paint a picture of government as an exceptionally as a hierarchical system that's
03:12:19 exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets and then i mean i tend to not subscribe to almost
03:12:26 any conspiracy theory to the degree at least that the conspiracy theorists do  i agree with you
03:12:34 but the there does seem to be and i tend to think of government as unfortunately   incompetent at least
03:12:41 the bureaucracy it seems that the communication like the three videos that were released
03:12:48 and just the way of dod in general talks about the things we've been talking about
03:12:55 it's just confused it's contradictory it's not inspiring it's it's  suspicious it's just not
03:13:03 even the way they release the videos you know the tic tac if presented correctly could just
03:13:09 inspire generation of scientists it's like at the you know us going to the moon
03:13:16 and it's inspiring i mean it's incredible like you know and and the way it was released was suspicious it was like
03:13:24 low resolution video on a crappy website like with some crappy documents and  i mean why what i don't know how to ask
03:13:31 this question but can government do better why are they doing it this way in terms of
03:13:37 communicating the things they do know to the public because i don't think they know how
03:13:42 especially in this topic it's been hidden for so many years and i don't think  because i don't buy
03:13:48 off on the conspiracy stuff i just think that you know when it comes in like i said you know the government
03:13:53 has a right to classify stuff they they classify everything because they don't know you have something you
03:13:57 don't know what it is you don't know so we just go well it must be must be top secret and let's put it in a
03:14:02 vault you know it's kind of like the indiana jones where they take the ark and they put it in the it's in the
03:14:07 giant army warehouse you know we don't even know what we have so but i also believe that you know and
03:14:15 i'll say this openly i don't think that the american people need to know everything i think there's
03:14:19 a reason that stuff is classified for the protection of this country and i totally believe in that so you know
03:14:27 and i was joking with joe when he was talking about storm area 51 stuff i'm like yeah that's probably the worst
03:14:33 idea you could possibly have is to just storm a military installation it's just stupid there are reasons there
03:14:39 are reasons that we have things that we don't just let out to the public because if we do as soon as you do let someone
03:14:46 know that you have something they immediately try and encounter it a perfect example
03:14:52 the u.s and the 60s developed a bomber it was a mach 3 compression lift bomber called the xb70
03:14:58 okay there was three of them built three of them ever built it was a like 60 000 foot high you know mach
03:15:05 3 it was an incredible airplane when you see it there's actually the last one remaining is in dayton ohio at the museum
03:15:10 you know it would go that wingtips would fall down it looks like a concord but when that got out that we were
03:15:18 developing it the soviet union developed the mig-25 literally a high-altitude interceptor to
03:15:24 counter that bomber and they built an entire fleet of mig-25s right we built three xb70s and we
03:15:34 scrapped the program right because now you go well it's the technology is cool we proved it but now
03:15:40 it becomes obsolete so it's not even worth building a whole fleet of these things you know it's constant it's a chess game
03:15:46 we do something they do something we do something they do something and it's we do something and then they counter it
03:15:50 they got a fee it's you got to figure out how to defeat it so you go oh we'll build something so
03:15:54 the more we keep  quiet especially from a defense standpoint the better we actually at person i think
03:16:02 we talk too much and i think the the military and the dod is starting to see that you know we're too open you know you
03:16:08 know you announce hey we're building this because there's a budget line and we live in a free society
03:16:14 but you don't have to release all the specs and you don't have to put everything in open source but that's a problem when we
03:16:19 go to the universities if we want to go do work with mit and you want to partner
03:16:25 with mit and you're a defense company and you want to partner you know you guys have a rule that if
03:16:30 you create it then it can be open source because the university owns it and we are an institution of learning yeah where
03:16:35 the defense side might go we don't we don't really want that published in a paper in scientific
03:16:40 america or i call it a break i talked to the cto of lockheed kaoko jackson
03:16:47 and just just conquers the some of the best if not the best engineering and science but engineering really
03:16:56 ever is done in secrecy and it sucks because it's so inspiring and they can't talk about it
03:17:03 it is due to funding the us government has deep pockets you know some of this new technology
03:17:08 that you develop for an open source unless this goes back to the original conversation we now there's enough money
03:17:14 in the private sector that individuals control yeah bezos i'm not talking amazon i'm talking jeff bezos a single
03:17:22 individual worth over a hundred billion dollars he has the ability to do stuff i'll tell you what the gates foundation with
03:17:28 between bill gates and and and his his wife and warren buffett and some of the other money because i
03:17:34 think  bezos's ex-wife actually donated a huge chunk of her half
03:17:39 into the gates foundation so i mean what's the gates foundation worth these days you know if and these are guys you know brilliant
03:17:47 brilliant i mean some of the greatest minds that we have to go you know what are they doing because they have the ability
03:17:51 it's a non-profit they can go hey i want to fund this i want to fund this research they can look beyond the conflict
03:17:56 between nations you can look beyond the conflict of having to have you know classification you can do what
03:18:01 you want you know it's just like you know we we classify how to do
03:18:07  you know the whole nuclear you know how to create critical mass right but there's really
03:18:12 smart high school kids that have figured out mathematically and they do their science project and then the government
03:18:16 comes in and says hey we got to classify your government because we just don't want this out in the public domain
03:18:21 which i understand but they never stop them from free thought and developing that it's just
03:18:26 we really don't want this out there okay so i understand that i totally understand that but
03:18:31 if they you know if if bill and melinda want to do this and go hey we want to do this and they're going to work with
03:18:34 bezos and they're going to work with elon and we're going to be think about it there's a significant
03:18:39 amount of money that could be available to r d and i'm not talking just science like this i'm talking
03:18:45 medical research and all this but then you go who gets it because now you're competing against
03:18:49 the companies that actually do it you go is that well are they the greatest minds i'd say you know that
03:18:57 we have a tendency to go these are the best that we have and i'd say well no that's the best that we know we have
03:19:01 but there's probably people out there that don't want to work there's brilliant minds that don't want to do
03:19:05 anything with defense because they just disagree with what it does so they go to another path
03:19:10 they can do something else and that in a sense like the elon's of the world that jeff bezos actually
03:19:18 in a certain sense much better than  dod at finding the brilliant weird minds out there because they're not tied to the
03:19:25 government so when you work a government contract the government writes they tell you what they want and then they work with you on
03:19:31 the requirements and they usually have a an end in mean you know they have an idea that this is what i want it to be
03:19:40 where if you go to like spacex where you know they come up with why don't we just
03:19:45 land these things on a pad and reuse them yeah well if the government scientists if you're on a government
03:19:49 contract says no that's not the requirements we're not paying for that we want you to do this you're kind of controlled
03:19:55 or when elon does it his company they can do whatever the hell they want to do because they have no bounds
03:19:59 the only bounds they have is the liability if it doesn't work and it lands on something so what do you do you
03:20:04 go out to kwajalein and you test it and if it crashes and it lands in the ocean hey we clean it up no big deal we lost
03:20:08 some money but we'll move on it's you know money makes the world go round
03:20:14 contrary to what everyone thinks but you know there's a lot of money that's sitting around that you can do a lot of
03:20:18 really cool stuff with and i don't know i mean i'll guarantee that  what is it blue origin
03:20:23 isn't that amazon yeah you know that they're doing some cool stuff because they have
03:20:28 funny and i joke with the guy i know that worked at spacex and he was funny because they were building
03:20:33 the first test thing and they they were limited and elon found this like 400 acre thing i think
03:20:41 it's about 400 acres down by waco texas and he's like i go how he goes he goes dude i worked he goes i worked with
03:20:47 he goes because he's done government contract he goes there's government contract and then there's
03:20:51 working at spacex with elon money and that's what he refers to it as his elon money where it was like
03:20:55 don't i'll throw them and he would throw the money at it and make it happen and it's i'm talking this fast yeah i mean he
03:21:01 talks about he has a great story about this i mean this is elon this is how fast you can do in the
03:21:05 private sector vice the government where there's the bureaucracy is they had a company that was a basically
03:21:10 a tool-and-die machine shop that did a lot of their high-precision parts for the rockets they had went to
03:21:17 the guy but he had contracts with other companies and when the economy was down the guy was actually looking at going
03:21:23 out of business so the guy i know he's telling me the story he he was talking to the guy he had to go over
03:21:27 there and get something and he's like holy he goes hang on so he calls up on the phone
03:21:32 spacex he says hey is elon there can you get him in the board room we'll be there in 20 minutes
03:21:36 so he grabs this guy who's literally going to fold his company they go over to spacex and i may be
03:21:42 getting some of this wrong if people are going to fact check me but this is pretty close
03:21:47 they go in the boardroom and and he said literally within like you know an hour or two elon has bought the guy's company that
03:21:55 guy is now a senior vp running the his company and they're gonna pull all the stuff
03:22:00 into the spacex thing so they can actually build the parts and they can still contract out to make the money outside
03:22:07 and it happened like that fast it's not just money it's because i've seen i witnessed it
03:22:11 too with elon i think it's  whatever the whatever the forces of capitalism that that 
03:22:19 allow a person like elon musk to rise to the top but like because i've also worked for
03:22:24 darpa like for research for in terms of a source of funding i i there's a weight of bureaucracy
03:22:31 when i was working like being funded by darpa and with elon like i was literally in the presence of like
03:22:37 anything is possible cutting across all the of paperwork of the way things were done in the past
03:22:43 of the bureaucracy the rules the constraints the all of that stuff just you can cut
03:22:48 across immediately how much money and time do you waste dealing with your bureaucracy when you could actually be
03:22:52 doing real work that's the difference this is why i honestly when i went back to the
03:22:58 industrial defense complex that we were warned about when you look at it and go spacex can do
03:23:03 something for half the price ahead of schedule that would boeing were paying boeing and you go oh
03:23:10 well this just came out you go well then why are we even dealing with this side when we can deal with this side yeah
03:23:14 because you've got a fully automated capsule that has a manual mode that they got to fly around in
03:23:20 it worked like a champ it went up it hung out it came back it splashed down it worked perfectly you know we're gonna
03:23:26 dust it off and oh by the way unlike the apollo capsules that were used and then
03:23:33 put to museums they're going to reuse that dragon capsule it came down they're going to dust it off put a new coat of
03:23:37 paint on it slap it on top of another rocket and away it goes holy cow it's amazing it's a shift it's
03:23:43 a complete shift and mentality and for us as taxpayers we can explore at half the cost
03:23:48 yeah it's exciting especially given putting the tic tac in context like then the sky or
03:23:56 but it's limitless the possibilities we could do with this kind of mechanism i think it's exciting yeah i think we live
03:24:00 in an exciting time right now besides everything that's messed up in the world right now well
03:24:04 this is a this is a hopeful like there's so much conflict going on so much tension  that's to me space exploration at the moment
03:24:13 is a reason to  get up in the morning and have a hope for the future to look up to the sky and
03:24:20 we're humans we can like solve so many we can solve all of this i was talking about when i was doing the tucker thing
03:24:25 and i said  this would be great you know because when the government had come out you
03:24:29 know a month ago and said hey this does exist we're doing this and we're going to release more stuff
03:24:35 and i was texting like lou and chris mellon and those guys before i went on because they had called
03:24:39 me up to be on tucker's show and i'm like hey i go you know this would be great you know
03:24:44 just come out with this find the the relic of a spaceship like pull out the roswell wreckage if you
03:24:49 have it pull out the roswell wreckage and do it god it would be so nice to not have to
03:24:54 deal with the the riots in the cities and i mean i know it's an election year and all that but
03:25:00 god it would be something it would be refreshing to not have to turn on my tv and see everything that is just
03:25:06 depressing in the world to begin holy cow we actually do have this and we're working on this technology
03:25:11 imagine if there is a roswell aircraft and they pull it out imagine the innovation that happens in
03:25:16 the next 10 to 20 years without any more information than that just the innovation that happens the look on
03:25:24 elon musk's face look on jeff bezos's face and all the brilliant engineers we changed the game it would change it
03:25:28 would change the game completely let me ask the big question i apologize for the absurd romantic nature
03:25:33 of it  outside i mean one of the things the fact that you've
03:25:41 laid your eyes on a ufo probably opened your eyes to the possibility that some of the other sightings
03:25:48 there there could be other sightings that have legitimacy to them what to use the outside of your own sighting
03:25:58 is the most interesting citing or ufo related event in history i think there's several what is it
03:26:04 ramishine forest in england  the u.s guys that saw stuff and actually got
03:26:10 radiation burns one guy was medically disabled but they weren't going to give it and he had
03:26:15 help from jim carr john mccain his office helped get the guys  disability reestablished
03:26:22 i think that's a big one  i think there's people out there that have seen stuff and i'm talking credible  because
03:26:28 there's you gotta remember there's a huge chunk of these sightings that get disproven they're they're
03:26:32 actually explainable yeah  you know you had sent me the question the the phoenix lights i think there's
03:26:41 what's that so i'm sorry i'm not familiar with some of these the the  i'm not either it's i want a funny
03:26:47 story on that so i was at a i was at a conference and hopefully he doesn't watch us to get
03:26:52 offended but we had this  this it was i call it speed dating so there's a table there's about eight
03:26:57 people at a table and we would go sit at the table and they could ask us questions and then
03:27:01 after 10 minutes we moved to the next table so i was speed dating all these people that are really into this yeah
03:27:07 it was kind of funny but i'd sat down and it's always funny because some people will try and dominate it but
03:27:11 you know you have to kind of push the dominators away so that you know if you're quiet and introverted you can ask your
03:27:17 question too so we got into this and the guy starts naming all these well what about this what about the phoenix lights
03:27:21 i'm like i don't know about the phoenix lights what about this event i don't know about that he goes
03:27:25 he looks at me and he goes well you're not a ufo guy i go no i'm not but i chase one so i'm an
03:27:30 expert have you and you could see him get deflated because i'm kind of a smart ass like that
03:27:35 yeah i mean the first hand experience from a credible in some sense these sightings have to do
03:27:40 both with the evidence and the human well i think part of that is to us
03:27:45 that's a credibility piece because the four of us that actually saw it plus you know the other two that were in the
03:27:50 airplane that shot the video none of us are ufo obsessed people so when we come out and say because to me
03:27:58 it's just it's five minutes of my life i mean i did a lot of really cool i've had really
03:28:04 kind of neat things i've been able to do but when you look at it and go  we don't it to me it wasn't it's not the
03:28:13 pinnacle of my life you know to other people that they live in the ufo world and
03:28:18 it's like they you know if you talk to people they'll go that are really into it who've never seen one
03:28:26 it kills them that they didn't see one when here we are because and what's unique with ours which kind of adds that
03:28:31 level is it wasn't we just didn't see it it wasn't like oh look something in the sky and it was weird we actually engaged
03:28:36 with it you know it was yeah that was an engaged five-minute thing and there's other
03:28:41 stories from other countries like there's a story of in the back in when the soviet union existed
03:28:46 that they actually would chase these things and one of them shot at some you know it shot it
03:28:51 because they said shoot at it and it shot it and then it got shot down and then they said don't ever shoot at
03:28:56 them again and don't chase them just you can observe them but don't go after them because obviously they have firepower
03:29:01 that we can't control because if you can make something float around and jam radars at will and do whatever you want
03:29:07 you know modern terrestrial weapons are probably not very useful you know you can go to independence day they add that force
03:29:12 field around oh we gotta we gotta now you gotta cyber warfare you gotta take the bug down you gotta take the warfare
03:29:17 so now we can actually inhibit some type of damage so there's a i mean you mentioned the phoenix slices
03:29:24 somebody on i think read it said  ask him any thoughts on mass ufo sightings like the phoenix lights so
03:29:30 the interesting thing like you said with the tic tac is that multiple people laid their eyes on this what what are
03:29:36 your thoughts about the phoenix lights or many people have seen here's the deal with massive sightings
03:29:41 so the phoenix lights is unexplainable although i know the air force had said something about it was an a10 drop in flares
03:29:47 no i don't think so yeah oh flares don't burn that long they just come out and they you know they detract when they go away
03:29:52 although on the other hand there's you know because clouds can do things so so i lived in central california for 18 years
03:29:59 and you would get oh my god what was that in the sky and it was really vandenberg shooting a missile off you
03:30:04 know they were doing icbm tests at one time where they shoot from vandenberg and they fly across and they go land in
03:30:09 the atoll at kwajalein you know and then they can check the displacement the accuracy and all that
03:30:14 stuff you know it's stuff that we do because we're a power but when you see them go up you
03:30:19 know especially if you've ever watched a rocket really launch on a clear night it'll have the stream the glow and you
03:30:22 can tell it's a rocket but if you don't look up until later when it starts to get to the outer edge of the
03:30:27 atmosphere where the plume coming out of the engine is not constrained but
03:30:31 you can watch this on tv when leaving the spacex ones go it's nice and narrow narrow narrow and then it hits a point
03:30:36 where it really starts to go up and it starts to come to the sides because there's the forces aren't holding that all into
03:30:41 one unique thing and it looks really odd and then it'll go off
03:30:46 because it burns out and then you get stage separation then you see the next one go off and then it's gone
03:30:52 and people don't understand that because they didn't watch it from launch because we used to sit in our driveway
03:30:56 and you know vandenberg is it was a three hour drive but you could sit and watch it go you knew they're launching
03:30:59 at night you'd watch you watch thing it's really cool if you don't see anything what you see is the
03:31:05 weird clouds from the exhaust plume you know what's left the residue that's sitting in the atmosphere and
03:31:09 the wind starts blowing it so you get these really kind of weird shapes in the sky you know that's part but when you go to
03:31:15 phoenix lights and you go hey you know when when a thousand people see something you're gonna discredit all a thousand
03:31:20 people are you gonna try and explain it away with something else you know you know the big it's a weather balloon
03:31:27 you know it's a weather balloon again just like the tic tac i think is just inspiring  for
03:31:35 the limitless nature of the science i think you're i think more is going to come out i
03:31:40 think some of the stuff that the the to the stars folks have done  so there's a stars academy yeah what
03:31:45 are your thoughts about them are they i talk to them quite a bit i am not a part of to the stars
03:31:51 academy i you know but you know like i talked to lou i just was texting him
03:31:57 before this yeah so he they're what's their mission what's their hope what's their what's there when they started
03:32:04 their mission was to try and don't look at this as little green men but let's look at this as a technology
03:32:11 and let's try and almost reverse engineer and figure out how these things operate and
03:32:16 how can we explain this from using our knowledge you know physics based knowledge to go how would something like
03:32:19 this operate that's really their bottom line was to try and use and then
03:32:24 couple that with because they've got the series unidentified couple that with television
03:32:32 to get the word out so you're actually putting something instead of because everyone has a theory you know
03:32:37 ancient aliens covers all kinds of theories you know it's kind of off of oh my god and i've seen the stuff and i've seen
03:32:44 stuff that i've said taken out of context on shows that i did not talk to  so there's all that because you can
03:32:50 take a clip and go oh it's this it's that you know and if i know about stuff like you can't technically use my
03:32:56 likeness unless i tell you you can so if i haven't signed something you can't do there was a guy who put
03:33:00 something out and i was in it i told him you can take it down and you talk to lawyers because i'm not
03:33:04 i'm not supporting you so they use it to tell some kind of narrative that this is not connected to let's face it if you're
03:33:10 making tv shows there's two reasons to do it one you want to get word out or two you want to make money or three
03:33:16 both and so usually it's i would say the the make money is probably the biggest thing to put a tv
03:33:20 show out and the the mission of the to the stars academy is to not do that
03:33:27 this is is to try to get some when i when they started and i talked to them because i've talked to tom and i've
03:33:31 talked to lou and those are the two main players it was to
03:33:38 basically demystify the fact and get rid of the the stigma that's tied to ufos and let's
03:33:43 look at it from a science base and then use tv to get the word out on the progress and they've done some pretty cool things
03:33:48 i mean you know they've the the italian government gave them all kinds of files that had been you know property their
03:33:55 government they got a bunch from it might have been argentina gave them all kinds of stuff like here's all our
03:34:00 records what can you do with it to try and now pull from country based to a more global
03:34:05 based research which is what you were talking about and then using independent scientists
03:34:10 that are not tied to a government i mean any government but just using independent research agencies to start
03:34:14 looking at some of the metallurgy because you go oh i found this we had this piece of metal what is it and some
03:34:18 of the stuff has been explained they've got some objects artifacts that have not been
03:34:23 explained and that's slowly coming out you know and i think  and your hope is the us government will release
03:34:28 well the government is the government the us government came out a month ago and said you know we have
03:34:32 we have  we have material that we cannot explain the origin they have said that they just haven't
03:34:38 released the wreckage from the roswell thing which i keep joking about i'm like come on it's 70 some years old
03:34:44 i mean let it out i i think he put it beautifully that in this time that would be a heck of an
03:34:50 inspiring hopeful thing to see like people don't just to distract them yeah the division is
03:34:58 i mean nothing will unite us humans descendants of chimps  like  the idea that there's life out
03:35:05 there oh it would literally change i said this a while ago i forget i think as the london
03:35:10 sun times had called me and i said you know personally i think this is a global issue it's not
03:35:14 if there is stuff coming down which we're pretty sure there is there's enough stuff that we can't explain
03:35:19 if there is stuff coming down then this is not a country based thing and it's not about technology and it's not about
03:35:24 who's going to win the next war because you don't know what they're doing so you got really
03:35:31 a couple of theories one you've got e.t or close encounters and the other extreme is you've got independence day
03:35:38 are you going to prepare and bet on et and close encounters or do you actually try and do stuff in
03:35:43 case it is independence that you actually have a game plan and when you get into independence day
03:35:48 that scenario you know and i don't like going too much into sci-fi but
03:35:53 let's just say in theory that that becomes a reality it's not a us russia China  england france spain
03:36:02 name any country and any continent it becomes a global issue and the only way you can deny it's just
03:36:08 like americans we all you know we're divided it it's been that way forever so if you think we won't get
03:36:13 through this we'll get through it because we've had times just like this before until nazi germany pops up but in nazi
03:36:19 germany pops up or someone flies two airplanes into the world trade center and then all of a sudden we're all like
03:36:23 united we also have very very short memories yes we do exactly it's when you look and go  well
03:36:32 we can do this and you go no no if if you think that everyone on the planet is good
03:36:40 you need to stop taking the drugs that you're taking you know we said this there were people during
03:36:46 the rise of hitler no no it's it's okay no no it's okay we're not gonna do we're not gonna stop no no it's okay no no
03:36:51 it's okay and you gotta think the only thing that stopped hitler
03:36:59 was his ego by going into russia if he just stuck with the pact with stalin and not went to the east
03:37:04 and had to fight and it was really the russian winner that crushed him and he would have put all his high
03:37:10 troops to the other side there would have been a totally different outcome the man in the iron
03:37:15 the man in the high tower whatever it's a netflix show where nazi actually wins it and you look you
03:37:19 know we didn't know everything that was going on especially the atrocities with the concentration
03:37:24 camps and what he was doing to to the jews i mean it's you look at that going if you really want to see evil and then
03:37:30 there's the whole side of what stalin did because he actually exterminated more people than hitler did
03:37:36 but that never gets the press and the thing is we forget this we forget this history
03:37:42 in our conflicts today we forget that there is the nature of evil we forget that there's real evil in the
03:37:47 world and the thing to fight that evil is to be united to be
03:37:55  both it's like this interesting line like you talked about joe rogan of being both like kind to each other compassionate
03:38:05 empathetic but also being like strong and a bad when you need to
03:38:11 to make sure that you that like there's a balance between kindness and force that is you you
03:38:18 use force when force is necessary but you don't have to walk around like billy badass all the time i mean some of the
03:38:23 toughest people that i grew up with that literally could kick the out of whoever came near him
03:38:28 they never got in fights because one even people that didn't know them because they were actually
03:38:32 nice guys you know they were they're just good dudes but you know if you cross them like i
03:38:37 had a friend of mine  he was he's a nationally ranked wrestler he went to went to naval academy with me
03:38:43 he's a very very good friend of mine and  he is when you meet him and he wrestled at 190 pounds and he did
03:38:52 not lose a match his senior year until he went to nationals he just had a bad day he actually lost to a guy he had
03:38:57 pummeled the out of and he would cross it was funny we we joke about it even with him because when
03:39:02 you meet him he's like the nicest like lo go hey hey dude you know hey how you doing he's super nice
03:39:08 he would cross that ring on a wrestling mat as soon as he crossed that ring it was like a totally different person
03:39:14 and he would go out there and just destroy people i mean physically destroy like put a
03:39:19 hurt on and he would get done and he's like super humble and they'd raise his hand
03:39:24 and he would he he'd have this blank expression they'd raise his hand and he'd walk off and as soon as he crossed
03:39:28 the line he'd he'd look up and smug hey hi guys how you doing like he literally just went
03:39:33 could rip someone's arms off but as soon as he crossed line he's a totally different person he's like
03:39:37 and he's that way today yeah he wouldn't even tell you he's a wrestler yeah that's kind of a symbol of the best of america
03:39:45 that's what america is oh he's that wrestler he's across the line you're you're  you could be hard but when
03:39:52 once you're off the mat you're just a kind human being yeah i know you're super humble
03:40:01  saying it's better to be lucky than good but your story is inspiring that
03:40:09 the entire trajectory of having a dream of accomplishing that dream of having one hell of a career what advice
03:40:17 would you give to a young person to a young version of yourself today that listens to this and is
03:40:25 inspired that wants to fly or wants to go to space who wants to build the rocket is there advice
03:40:31 you could give them about life about career about anything yeah yeah first let me start with  and you had a
03:40:41 question on inspirational people so my grandfather i had mentioned him earlier a huge funeral
03:40:49 a beer delivery guy was delivering beer and the 60s riots were the the guys the black in the black
03:40:54 neighborhoods where you know white people didn't go and my grandfather's sicilian he was one
03:40:58 of the first ones in his family born in the united states so my great grandmother and i had aunts and
03:41:02 uncles that i knew growing up that actually came over on the boat huge huge guy and just the nicest
03:41:10 friendliest would give you the shirt off his back obviously proven by his funeral and i'm talking at his funeral
03:41:15 the head of the black panthers was at his funeral in in toledo ohio the mafia guys were at his funeral in
03:41:22 toledo ohio  i mean it was literally a mix of of of who's who and he had told me once
03:41:28 you know because when you're little you start looking and i grew up basically i was probably middle class lower middle
03:41:33 class my dad was a fireman you're not rich he's working for the city it was a paycheck to paycheck living is how i
03:41:38 grew up and i was talking my grandfather one day and he said something to me and this is
03:41:41 this is literally how i run my life he said it was about money because you'd see you know back in the day if
03:41:46 you saw someone in a mercedes that was rare you know they weren't everywhere and you know people didn't you couldn't lease a
03:41:50 car you actually bought a car and usually bought a car with cash so it's a totally different than we
03:41:56 are now and he said he goes you know david he goes they're no better than you and you're no better
03:42:01 than anyone else he goes you got to remember that he goes everyone's different he goes treat
03:42:06 everyone with the respect and dignity that they deserve he goes and if they're poor if they're
03:42:10 homeless he goes it doesn't make him a bad person it just that's that's who they chose to
03:42:15 be and you make choices in your life but never ever look down on someone because
03:42:19 you know there will always be someone that will look down on you and you should never ever do that
03:42:23 and i kept that close to me he was a huge influence was my mom's dad just a big big influence in my life
03:42:31 and the way i carried myself and he was one that would say you know you can be anything you want to
03:42:38 be you know he grew up dirt poor you know and the fact that he had bought a house and took good care of my
03:42:43 grandmother and did stuff like that you know to him that was a success and to me it was always you know trying to
03:42:48 better and move on and he was the one you know my parents were a big part of this too
03:42:54 was instilling that anything is possible so when i'm four years and 11 months old in 1969
03:42:59 you know and i'm watching neil armstrong walk on the moon and i'm asking my mom and she says well they were all military
03:43:04 pilots and you know we had an international guard that at the time was flying f-100 so i'm dating myself
03:43:11 and i was just fascinated with flight and i just looked at that going that's really what i want to do and i never
03:43:15 lost sight of that there was always i could do this or do that and when i was going to go to college before
03:43:19 i enlisted in the marine corps i was accepted into natural resources at ohio state and i'm like ah
03:43:24 if i can't fly i'll go be a forest ranger because i wanted to hang out in one of those towers in colorado and look
03:43:29 for fires because that's just i like that stuff you know it was that or be an oceanographer because i was
03:43:33 fascinated with jacques cousteau and i actually that's my degree my undergrad degree is jacques cousteau
03:43:38 so influences are neil armstrong and jack cousteau i have an oceanography degree i got an mba from university of houston
03:43:44 goku's got to mention them and then  and so you're looking people go what are you what are you going to do
03:43:49 with that and i said you know i got an oceanography degree because i go well i'm going to sail on the ocean so at
03:43:53 least if the ship sinks i'll know where i'm at and that was a kind of a running joke
03:43:58 and then and then there's so these passions and underneath it is the is the belief that you can be anything
03:44:05 you want to you can you know i told my kids this you know when they were young you know it was
03:44:09 tough especially for my son so when nate was about five six years we knew nate was
03:44:13 colorblind you know my my wife's brothers are both colorblind it's really color deprived cleared
03:44:17 applying you see black and white he can't tell he has issues with greens reds browns it's funny if you're ever
03:44:22 around someone like that because he'll go i'll go what are you looking at he goes right over there by
03:44:26 the red thing i'm like what are you looking at i go this i like he had a hat on one
03:44:29 dagger which one are you gonna eat he had a hat in his hand it was green he goes i'm gonna get the green one i go oh
03:44:33 this one right here he goes no the one in my head i go nate that one's brown he's like
03:44:37 leave me alone dad he got the brown hat because to him it looked great yeah so he couldn't fly he came he said
03:44:43 i go what do you want to do nate you know you're talking to your kids and what do you want to use i want to be a
03:44:47 pilot no now i got to tell him because he's looking at me because i'm a pilot do you can't be a pilot he's like why
03:44:52 can't i be a pilot i said because you you got eye issues you know so you got to redirect
03:44:58 and the other one was because i had i stopped flying i was 42 years old and i was like and it was my childhood
03:45:03 dream so it's like a pro athlete i know exactly what it feels like when you know brett favre has to walk
03:45:09 away from the nfl when you still can do it good choice of quarterback by the way the greatest of all time but whatever
03:45:15 so you you do when you look at it and you go i understand what those guys feel like
03:45:18 when you have to walk away from something that you love and you think you can still do it
03:45:24 so i told them i said look i was talking to both my kids and i said you know find something that you
03:45:31 want to do that you love to do and that you can do your whole life and you should be able to do good things
03:45:37 for other people you want to be able to help other people that's what i said
03:45:43 so both of my kids and there's no one in my family both of my children one of them is
03:45:47 my daughter is a doctor doing residency in internal medicine right now and my son is in his third year and
03:45:53 they're both going to be doctors and until i look at it is you know people go oh you got two dogs i don't
03:45:58 care i told my kids if you want to be a garbage man or you want to dig ditches i don't care just be
03:46:04 be the best ditch digger that you can be i said and be happy doing it because what you also find is that
03:46:09 we are in this big pursuit of money money money money money might be that's what makes the world go around but
03:46:13 what you realize and i'll go back to my grandfather who didn't have a lot of money and he was probably one of the most
03:46:18 happy people on life and unfortunately he died he died at 65 he had a massive heart
03:46:22 attack because he didn't tell that he he kind of knew what was happening and he just made the choice to
03:46:27 to do and it was devastating to the entire family but he didn't he didn't have a lot of
03:46:32 money but i'll tell you what i know a lot of rich people who have funerals and there's nobody adam
03:46:37 yeah and my grandfather who's a beer delivery guy had i i i it literally it was like three miles
03:46:44 long the pope it was crazy yeah who died that was because it was like he's a catholic he's just you know italian he goes
03:46:48 you know who died the pope and i go now that's my grandfather and then the next funeral i went to was my aunt his sister
03:46:54 and there was like you know 30 people and i looked at my mother and i said where's everybody at
03:47:00 she goes oh no this is normal this is what a normal funeral looks like so it's
03:47:06 you know for young kids bottom line one be nice kindness will get you i'm a big believer in karma
03:47:11 kindness will get you a long way in the world you know it's easy it's it it's easy to be nice it doesn't
03:47:17 cost you anything i said you know and get rid of the hate and number two is
03:47:22 follow your dreams because everyone is capable of everything and there's a there's a self realism like
03:47:27 you know if you really have trouble with math getting a phd in applied math is probably not something you're going to
03:47:33 be able to do but understand yourself what your own capabilities are and you know inside your heart don't let anyone
03:47:38 ever tell you what you can and can't do you have to determine that yourself and go for it and and and you can do anything
03:47:46 it's just it's it's a great the world's incredible it really is let me ask the last yeah big ridiculous question  so you've lived
03:47:56 much of your life your career is kind of at the edge of life and death so let me ask kind of 
03:48:05 several different ways the same kind of question one d do you have you pondered your
03:48:12 mortality the finiteness of it and the bigger question to ask even in the context of
03:48:21 your  tic tac encounter is  what do you think is the meaning of this  thing we got going on here
03:48:26 the meaning of life so let me start with have i pondered my own mortality yes
03:48:37 quite often and i don't get into my religious beliefs or what i am but i will tell you that i do believe in
03:48:44 god i've just seen too many things in the world that i can't explain and some people will explain it by
03:48:49 subconscious so i'll give you a story and this kind of puts in the thing of do i fear death so i had a good friend
03:48:54 of mine that i used to fly with we were stationed in japan together and japan had this incinerator that put
03:49:00 all kinds of dioxins so there's a real high cancer rate for those that served on the base
03:49:10 him and his wife had one son and their son passed away just before his 18th birthday of cancer
03:49:17 and i was hanging out with i'll call him john and i was hanging out with john we were in oil and gas he'd come to the same
03:49:22 company and we were doing an event together and he was opening up to me
03:49:26 because we were actually the demo pilots we do the demonstration for air shows and stuff
03:49:31 and  him and i were sitting there talking and  he was giving me the whole story and and
03:49:39 how he really changed his look on life that we're only here for a finite time and that we're all going to die
03:49:44 well unfortunately after all that when it was really going him and his wife had moved to
03:49:49 a location that fit their you know close to the water where they could do stuff and i won't say where
03:49:55 and he was doing what he loved to do and i was talking to him  it was probably about
03:50:08 maybe two months before he died and i said dude hey you're sad you mean this is your friend
03:50:15 and i'm kind of really bummed out and this is the guy this is a guy that's dying of cancer and
03:50:20 here's what he tells me he says dave dude we're all going to die he goes but i have to look at it i have
03:50:28 to make the best of the time that i have and i said i understand that he goes with the exception
03:50:34 of not being with my wife who he loved dearly he goes i'm okay with dying i've had a really good life and
03:50:46 about because actually the original announcement when he when he finally
03:50:50 passed away a buddy of mine called me because i don't do facebook and his wife had put it on facebook that he
03:50:54 had passed and about the day before he died for some reason i was thinking about him
03:51:02 and i had a dream or i think it was a dream or an altered reality you can get into whatever 
03:51:10 but he was there it was just him and i and i was really sad in the dream i was actually crying
03:51:15 and he was there and he was actually in his uniform he was in his whites and  because he's a navy and we were just
03:51:21 talking and he looked at me and he said and this is in my dream he's like dave it's all gonna be okay and this is this
03:51:28 is like and this is a vivid conversation i have this people are don't think i'm weird about this but
03:51:33 but you know i know what my dream was and you know maybe it's my subconscious creating the dream but in in reality to
03:51:39 me this was real that it was put there for a reason he's and he basically explained
03:51:43 everything he's it's okay i'm gonna be fine my wife is fine he goes this is this is what's meant to be
03:51:50 you know but you know and the bottom line was make use of every day that you have because you don't know and literally two
03:51:57 days later i find out that he passed so but ultimately he accepted the finiteness of it he did
03:52:05 well you have to and it's like i talk about you know money and job position and this and that
03:52:10 i said you can get in any you know you can go to a company just remember when you want to be a vp of a company you
03:52:14 sell your soul to the company you have to i said if you look i joke with people at work and i said
03:52:20 i said you know when you ever think that you're important or this guy has that i said when you're sitting on 93 or 95 128
03:52:26 and you're sitting in traffic and we're stopped which doesn't happen right now because of covet but normally it's stop
03:52:30 it's bumper to bumper and you're sitting here like i was coming down here by the gas tank um
03:52:36 when you're sitting there look left and look right you know and there can be a lamborghini or an s550 mercedes and on
03:52:42 the other side there could be some piece of crap car we're all sitting on the same freeway at
03:52:48 the same time trying to do the same thing which is just get home so we can be with our family
03:52:52 because the most important thing that we have it ain't money it ain't our job it's not our position i go because when it's all
03:52:59 said and done you could be you know you can be with the exception of the presidents of the
03:53:04 united states i mean name the vice presidents most people can't and eventually they're going to die or
03:53:11 eventually you're going to see a statue of a guy from the 1700s in the boston area and you're going to go i don't even
03:53:16 know who that guy was did he impact my life he probably did but eventually people forget
03:53:22 yeah you you realize what's important now and the one thing that you have is your family and your close friends
03:53:28 and that's that's it you can take all the money or everything else if you're down on your luck
03:53:34 you know who is going to be a we is joke who are your true friends it's the person while there's there's
03:53:39 ones that i won't say but you know hey you're broke down on a road in the middle of nowhere and it's three o'clock
03:53:43 in the morning who you gonna call is gonna get in their car without complaining and come and get you
03:53:49 and that's life those that is life the people you love it's it's it's the people you truly care
03:53:54 about and contrary to i have you know oh my god i got 6 000 facebook friends you got about
03:53:59 that many real friends that you can count on and that's it everything else doesn't matter
03:54:04 no it doesn't matter it doesn't mean you might be nice i mean i have there's acquaintance friends that i'll do
03:54:08 anything for and then come to my house and stuff but then there's the people that you know
03:54:12 you know like my cousins who are like my brothers that you know at a moment's notice you know when
03:54:21 when my uncle passed away at a young age you know who lived literally right down the street from me
