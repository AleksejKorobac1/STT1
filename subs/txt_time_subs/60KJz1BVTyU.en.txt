00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Jack Dorsey co-founder and CEO of Twitter and founder and CEO of square
00:00:11 given the happenings at the time related to Twitter leadership and the very limited time we had we decided to focus
00:00:17 this conversation on square and some broader philosophical topics and to save an in-depth conversation on engineering
00:00:24 at AI and Twitter for second appearance in this podcast this conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the
00:00:30 pandemic for everyone feeling the medical psychological and financial burden of this crisis
00:00:36 I'm sending love your way stay strong we're in this together we'll beat this thing as an aside let me
00:00:43 mention the jack moved 1 billion dollars square equity which is 28% of his wealth to form an organization that funds kovin
00:00:53 19 relief first as Andrew yang tweeted this is a spectacular commitment and second it is amazing that it operates
00:01:00 transparently by posting all its donations to a single Google Doc to me true transparency is simple and this is
00:01:10 as simple as it gets this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube review it
00:01:15 with five stars an apple podcast supported on patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter and Lex Friedman
00:01:23 spelled Fri D ma n as usual I'll do a few minutes of as now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of

00:01:43 about masterclass I thought it was too good to be true for $180 a year you get an all-access pass to watch courses from
00:01:51 to list some of my favorites Chris Hadfield on space exploration Neil deGrasse Tyson and scientific thinking
00:01:58 communication will write creator of Sim City and Sims both one of my favorite games on game design Jane Goodall on
00:02:07 conservation Carlos Santana on guitar on my favorite guitar players Gary Kasparov on chess Daniel Negreanu on poker and many
00:02:15 many more chris hadfield explaining caracas work and the experience of being launched into space alone is worth the
00:02:22 money for me the key is to not be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice pick three courses you want to complete
00:02:28 watch each all the way through it's not that long but it's an experience that will stick with you for a long time it's
00:02:35 easily worth the money you can watch it on basically any device once again sign up on master class comm / Lex to get a
00:02:43 discount and to support the spot cast and now here's my conversation with Jack Dorsey you've been on several podcasts
00:02:53 Joe Rogan Sam Harris rich roll others excellent conversations but I think there's several topics that you didn't
00:03:00 talk about that I think of fascinating that I love to talk to you about sort of machine learning artificial intelligence
00:03:05 both the the narrow kind and the general kind and engineering at scale so there's a lot of incredible engineering going on
00:03:14 the year part of crypto cryptocurrency a blockchain ubi all kinds of philosophical questions maybe we'll get
00:03:20 to while life and death and meaning and beauty so you're involved in building some of the biggest network systems in
00:03:28 the world sort of trillions and interactions a day the cool thing about that is the infrastructure the
00:03:35 engineering scale you started as a programmer with C by building yeah so I'm a hacker I'm not really an engineer
00:03:43 not not a legit software engineer and I'm a tracker at heart but to achieve scale you have to do some unfortunately
00:03:50 legit large-scale engineering so how do you make that magic happen hire people that I can learn from number one I mean
00:04:00 I'm a hacker in the sense that I you know my approach has always been do whatever it takes to make it work so
00:04:07 that I can see and feel the thing and then learn what needs to come next and oftentimes what needs to come next is a
00:04:15 matter of being able to bring it to more people which is scale and there's a lot of great people out there that either
00:04:25 have experience or are extremely fast learners that we've been lucky enough to find and with for four years but I think a lot of
00:04:38 it we benefit a ton from the open source community and just all the learnings there that are laid bare in the open all
00:04:46 the mistakes all the success all the problems it's a very slow-moving process usually open source but it's very
00:04:56 deliberate and you get to see because of the the pace you get to see what it takes to really build something
00:05:04 meaningful so I learned most most of everything I learned about hacking and programming and engineering has been due
00:05:14 to open source and and the the generosity that people have given to give up their time sacrificer time
00:05:24 without any expectation in return other than being a part of something much larger than themselves yeah just great
00:05:32 open-source movement is amazing but if you just look at the scale like Square has to take care of is this a
00:05:38 fundamentally a software problem or hardware problem you mentioned hiring a bunch of people but said it's not maybe
00:05:46 from our perspective not often talked about how incredible that is to sort of have a system that doesn't go down often
00:05:54 that secure is able to take care of all these transactions like maybe I'm I'm also a hacker at heart and it's
00:06:01 incredible to me that that kind of scale could be achieved is there some insight some lessons some interesting tidbits
00:06:10 that you can say about how to make that scale happen is it the hardware fundamentally challenge is it a software
00:06:21 challenge is it like is it a social challenge of building large teams of engineers that work together that kind
00:06:26 of thing that quotes is there what's the interesting challenges there by the way you're the best Russ hacker I've ever
00:06:34 met I think thank you both if the enumeration you just went through I don't think there's one you have to kind
00:06:41 of focus on all and the ability to focus on all that really comes down to how you these problems and whether you can break
00:06:53 them down into parts that you can focus on because I think the biggest mistake is trying to solve or address too many
00:07:04 at once or not going deep enough with the questions or not being critical of the answers you find or not form not
00:07:14 taking the time to form credible hypotheses that you can actually test and you can see the result of so all of
00:07:24 those fall in the face of ultimately critical thinking skills problem-solving skills and if there's one skill I want
00:07:31 to improve every day it's that that's that's what contributes to learning and the only way we can evolve any of these
00:07:40 things is learning what is currently doing and and how to take it to the next the next step and questioning
00:07:46 assumptions the first principle is kind of thinking it seems like the fundamentals this whole process yeah but
00:07:53 if you get to overextend it into well this is a hardware issue you miss all the software solutions and you know vice
00:08:01 versa if you focus too much on the software there are hardware solutions that can 10x the thing so I I try to
00:08:13 resist the categories of thinking and look for the underlying systems that make all these things work but those
00:08:22 only emerge when you have a skill around creative creative thinking problem-solving and being able to ask
00:08:34 critical questions and having the patience to like go deep so one of the amazing things if you look at the
00:08:41 mission of square is to increase people's access to the economy maybe maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong
00:08:48 that's from my perspective so from the perspective of merchants peer-to-peer payments even crypto cryptocurrency
00:08:55 digital cryptocurrency what do you see as the major ways our society can increase but this
00:09:00 patient in the economy so if we look at today in the next 10 years next 20 years you going to Africa maybe in Africa and
00:09:06 all kinds of other places outside in North America if there was one word that I think represents what we're trying to
00:09:18 do at square it's it is that word access one of the things we found is that we weren't expecting this at all when we
00:09:25 started we thought were just building a a piece of hardware to enable people to plug it into their phone and swipe
00:09:33 credit card and then as we talked with people who actually tried to accept credit cards in the past we found a
00:09:40 consistent theme which many of them weren't even enabled and enabled but allowed to process credit cards and we
00:09:49 dug a little bit deeper again asking that question and we found that a lot of them would go to banks or these
00:09:58 merchants acquirers and waiting for them was a credit check and looking at a FICO score and many of the businesses that we
00:10:09 talked to and many small businesses they don't have good credit or a credit history they're entrepreneurs were just
00:10:17 getting started taking a lot of personal risk financial risk and it just felt ridiculous to us
00:10:28 that for for for the for the job of being able to accept money from people you had to get your credit checked and
00:10:36 as we dug deeper we realized that that wasn't the intention of the financial industry but it's the only tool they had
00:10:43 available to them to understand authenticity intent predictor of future behavior so that's the first thing we
00:10:51 actually looked at and that's where the you know we built the hardware but the software really came in terms of risk
00:10:59 modeling and that's when we started down the path that eventually leads to AI we started with a very strong data science
00:11:09 discipline because we knew that our business was not necessarily about making hardware it was more about
00:11:17 enabling more people to come into the system so the fundamental challenge there is so to enable more people to
00:11:24 come into the system you have to lower the barrier of checking that that person would be a legitimate vendor is that the
00:11:33 fundamental problem yeah and a different mindset I think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset of kind of
00:11:46 distrust and just constantly looking for opportunities to prove why people shouldn't get into the system whereas we
00:11:55 took on a mindset of trust and then verify verify verify verify verify so we moved you know when we when we entered
00:12:06 the space only about thirty to forty percent of the people who apply to accept credit cards would actually get
00:12:10 through the system we took that number than 99% and that's because we reframe the problem we built
00:12:22 credible models and we had this mindset of we're going to watch not at the merchant level but we're going to watch
00:12:30 at the transaction level so come in perform some transactions and as long as you're doing things that feel high
00:12:38 integrity credible and don't look suspicious we'll continue to to serve you if we see any interestingness in how
00:12:47 you use our system that will be bubbled up to people to review to figure out if there's something nefarious going on and
00:12:56 that's when we might ask you to leave so the change in the mindset led to the technology that we needed to enable more
00:13:07 people to get there and to enable more people to access system what  what role does machine learning
00:13:14 play into that in that context of you said first of all that's a beautiful shift anytime you shift your viewpoint
00:13:21 into seeing that people are fundamentally good and then you just have to
00:13:27 verify and catch the ones who are not as opposed to assuming everybody's bad this is a beautiful thing so what role does
00:13:35 the to you throughout the history of the company has machine learning played in doing
00:13:41 that verification it was it was a media I mean we weren't calling it machine learning but it was data science and
00:13:47 then as the industry evolved machine learning became more of the nomenclature and and as that evolved it became more
00:13:56 sophisticated with deep learning and as I continues continues to evolve it'll be nobody another thing but they're all in
00:14:02 the same vein but we built that discipline up within the first year of the company because we also had you know
00:14:11 we have to we had to partner with a bank we had to partner with Visa MasterCard and we had to show that by bringing more
00:14:19 people into the system that we could do so in a responsible way that would not compromise their systems and that they
00:14:26 would trust us how do you convince this upstart company with some cool machine learning tricks is able to deliver on
00:14:34 the sort of a trustworthy set of merchants we we stage it out in tears we had a bucket of you know five hundred
00:14:42 people using it and then we showed results in a thousand and then ten thousand that fifty thousand and then
00:14:50 the constraint was left was lifted so again it's it's kind of you know getting something tangible out there I want to
00:14:56 show what we can do rather than talk about it and that put a lot of pressure on us to do the right things and it also
00:15:07 created a culture of accountability of a little bit more transparency and I think incentivized all of our early folks and
00:15:18 the company in the right way so what does the future look like in terms of increasing people's access or if you
00:15:25 look at IO T Internet of Things there's more and more intelligent devices you can see there's some people even talking
00:15:32 about our personal data as a thing that we could monetize more explicitly versus implicitly sort of everything can become
00:15:38 part of the economy you see so what what is the future of square look like instead of giving
00:15:45 people access in all kinds of ways to being part of the economy as merchants and as consumers I believe that the
00:15:55 currency we use is is a huge part of the answer and I believe that the Internet deserves and requires a native currency
00:16:04 and that's why I'm I'm such a huge believer in in Bitcoin because it just our our biggest problem is a company
00:16:14 right now is we cannot act like an Internet company opened a new market we have to have a partnership with local
00:16:21 bank we have to pay attention to different regulatory onboarding environments and a digital currency like
00:16:31 Bitcoin takes in a bunch of that away where we can potentially launch a product in every single market around
00:16:38 the world because they're all using the same currency and we we have consistent
00:16:46 understanding of regulation and onboarding and-and-and what that means so I think you know the the internet
00:16:55 continuing to be accessible to people is number one and then I think currency is is number two and it will just allow for
00:17:05 a lot more innovation a lot more speed in terms of what we can build and others can build and it's just it's just really exciting
00:17:13 so I mean I would I want to be able to see that and feel that in my lifetime so in this aspect in other aspects you have
00:17:22 a deep interest in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger tech in general I talked to metallic butterman yesterday
00:17:28 on this podcast he says hi by the way hey he's a brilliant brilliant person talking a lot about Bitcoin and
00:17:37 aetherium of course so can you maybe linger on this point what what do you find appealing about Bitcoin about
00:17:44 digital currency where do you see it going in the next 10 20 years and what are some of the challenges with respect
00:17:50 to Square but also just bigger far for a globally farah world for the way we we think
00:18:00 about money I I think the most beautiful thing about it is there's no one person setting the direction and there's no one
00:18:08 person on the other side that can stop it so we have something that is pretty organic in nature and very principled in
00:18:21 its original design and I you know I think the Bitcoin white paper is one of the most seminal works of computer
00:18:28 science in the last 20 30 years it's it's poetry I mean it's a really cool technology I mean that's not often
00:18:34 talked about sort of there's so much sort of hype around digital currency about the financial impacts of it but
00:18:40 the actual technology is quite beautiful from a computer science perspective yeah and the underlying principles behind it
00:18:46 that went into it even to the point of releasing it under a pseudonym I think that's a very very powerful statement
00:18:53 the timing of when it was released is powerful it was it was a total activist move I mean it's it's moving the world
00:19:03 forward and in a way that I think is extremely noble and honorable and enables everyone to be part of the story
00:19:13 which is also really cool so you ask the question around 10 years in 20 years I mean I think the amazing thing is no one
00:19:21 knows and it can emerge and every person that comes into the ecosystem whether they be a developer or someone who uses
00:19:31 it can change its direction in small and large ways and that's what I think it should because that's what the the
00:19:38 Internet has shown is possible now there's complications with that of course and there's you know certainly
00:19:44 companies that own large ports so the you know net and conducted more than others and there's not equal access to
00:19:51 every single person in the world just yet but all those problems are visible enough to speak about them and to me
00:19:58 that gives confidence that they're solvable in a relatively short timeframe I think the world changes a lot
00:20:08 as we get these satellites projecting the internet down down earth because it just removes a bunch of the former
00:20:16 constraints and and really levels the playing field but a global currency which a native currency for the Internet
00:20:25 is a proxy for is a very powerful concept and I don't think any one person on this planet truly understands the
00:20:32 ramifications of that I think there's a lot of positives to it there's some negatives as well but I think it's
00:20:37 possible sorry to interrupt do you think it's possible that this kind of digital currency would redefine the nature of
00:20:45 money so become the main currency of the world as opposed to being tied to fiat currency of different nations and to
00:20:53 really push the decentralization of control of money definitely but I think the the bigger ramification is how it
00:21:02 affects how society works and I think there were there there are many positive ramifications outside around money
00:21:09 just outside of just money money money is a foundational layer that enables so much more I was meeting with an
00:21:16 entrepreneur in Ethiopia and payments is probably the number one problem to solve across a continent
00:21:23 both in terms of moving money across borders between nations on the continent or the amount of corruption within the
00:21:36 current system but the lack of easy ways to pay people makes starting anything really difficult I met an entrepreneur
00:21:46 who started the the lyft / uber of Ethiopia and one of the biggest problems she has is that it's not easy for her
00:21:55 writers to pay the company it's not easy for her to pay the drivers and that definitely has stunted her growth and
00:22:03 made everything more challenging so the fact that she's she even has to think about payments instead of thinking about
00:22:10 the best writer experience and the best driver experience is is pretty telling so I think as we get
00:22:22 a more durable resilient and global standard we see a lot more innovation everywhere and I think there's no better
00:22:30 case study for this than the various countries with and within Africa and and their entrepreneurs who are trying to
00:22:36 start things within health or sustainability or transportation or a lot of the companies that we've seen
00:22:44 that we've seen here so the majority of companies I met in November when I spent a month on the continent were payments
00:22:53 oriented you mentioned there's a small tangent you mentioned the anonymous launch of Bitcoin is a sort of profound
00:23:02 philosophical statement sudama's what's that even means there's a pseudonym for said there's an identity tied to it it's
00:23:10 not just anonymous it's a Nakamoto so a Nakamoto might represent one person or multiple people but let me ask are you
00:23:16 Satoshi Nakamoto just just checking thank you I wear what I tell you yes sure but maybe you slip a pseudonym
00:23:25 is constructed identity anonymity is just kind of as you know ran random like drop something off and leave there's no
00:23:34 intention to build an identity around it and well the identity being built was a short time window it was meant to stick
00:23:47 around I think and to be known and it's being honored in you know how the community thinks about building out like
00:23:55 the concept of Satoshi Toshi's for instance is one such an example but I think it was smart not to do it
00:24:04 anonymous not to do it as a real identity but to do it as soon an MB because I think it builds tangibility
00:24:11 and a little bit of empathy that this was a human or a set of humans behind it and there's there's this natural
00:24:20 identity that I can imagine but there is also sacrifice of an ego that's a pretty powerful thing from beautiful would you
00:24:29 do sort of philosophically to ask you the question would you do all the same things you're doing now if
00:24:35 your name wasn't attached to it sort of if if you had to sacrifice the ego put another way is your ego deeply tied in
00:24:45 the decisions you've been making I hope not I mean I I believe I would certainly attempt to do the things without my name
00:24:55 having to be attached with it but it's hard to do that in a corporation legally that's the issue if I were to do more
00:25:06 open-source things then absolutely like I don't don't need my particular identity my real identity associated
00:25:15 with it but I think you know the appreciation that comes from doing something good and being able to see it
00:25:23 and see people use it is is pretty overwhelming and powerful more so than maybe seeing your name in the in the
00:25:32 headlines let's talk about artificial intelligence a little bit if we could 70 years ago Alan Turing formulated the
00:25:39 Turing test to me natural language is one of the most interesting spaces of problems that are tackled by artificial
00:25:46 intelligence it's the canonical problem of what it means to be intelligent he formulated as the Turing test me ask
00:25:53 sort of the broad question how hard do you think is it to pass the Turing test in the space of language just from a
00:26:02 very practical standpoint I think where we are now and and for at least years out is one where the artificial
00:26:12 intelligence machine learning the deep learning models can bubble up interestingness very very quickly
00:26:22 and pair that with human discretion around severity around depth around nuance and and meaning I think for me
00:26:35 the chasm the cross for general intelligences to be able to explain why and the meaning behind something
00:26:45 behind a decision mm-hmm for being behind the decision so we got a sub so Delta so the explained ability part is
00:26:52 kind of essential to be able to explain using natural language why the decisions were made that kind of thing yeah I mean
00:26:58 I think that's one of our biggest risk and artificial intelligence going forward is we are building a lot of
00:27:04 black boxes that can't necessarily explain why they made a decision or what criteria they used to make the decision
00:27:10 and we're trusting them more and more from lending decisions to content recommendation to driving to health like
00:27:20 you know a lot of us have watches that tell us to understand how was it deciding that I mean that that one's
00:27:26 pretty pretty simple but you can imagine how complex they get and being able to explain the reasoning behind some of
00:27:33 those recommendations seems to be an essential part although it's a very hard problem because sometimes even we can't
00:27:41 explain why we make this that's what I was I think we're being us sometimes a little bit unfair for to artificial
00:27:46 intelligence systems because we're not very good at these some of these things do you think a project for the ridiculous
00:27:55 romanticized question but on that line of thought do you think we'll ever be able to build a system like in the movie
00:28:03 her that you could fall in love with so have that kind of deep connection with hasn't that already happened hasn't
00:28:09 someone in Japan fallen in love with this who's AI there's always going to be somebody that does that kind of thing I
00:28:18 mean at a much larger scale of actually building relationships of being deeper connections it doesn't have to be love
00:28:24 but it just deeper connections with artificial intelligence systems you mentioned explained it there's lots
00:28:29 of function of the artificial intelligence and more a function of the individual and how they find meaning and
00:28:35 where they find meaning do you think we humans can find meaning in technology in this kind of way yeah 100 percent 1
00:28:41 percent and I don't necessarily think it's a negative but I you know it's it's constantly going to evolve so I don't
00:28:54 know but I meaning is is something that's entirely subjective and I I don't think it's going to be a
00:29:02 function of finding the magic algorithm that enables everyone to love it but maybe but that question really gets that
00:29:11 the difference between human and machine the you had a little bit of an exchange with Elon Musk basically I mean it's a
00:29:20 trivial version of that but I think there's a more fundamental question of is it possible to tell the difference
00:29:28 between a bot and a human and do you think it's if we look into the future 10 20 years out do you think it would be
00:29:35 possible or is it even necessary to tell the difference in the digital space between a human and a robot can we have
00:29:42 fulfilling relationships with each or do we need to tell the difference between them I think it's certainly useful and
00:29:49 certain problem domains to be able to tell the difference I think in others it might not be as useful I think it's
00:29:58 possible for us today tell that difference as the reverse the meta of the Turing test well what's interesting
00:30:09 is I think the technology to create is moving much faster than the technology to detect you think so so if you look at
00:30:16 like adversarial machine learning there's a lot of systems that try to fool machine learning systems and at
00:30:23 least for me the hope is that the technology to defend will always be right there at least your sense is that
00:30:31 I don't know if they'll be right there I mean it's it's a race right so the detection technologies have to be 2 or
00:30:41 10 steps ahead of the creation technologies this is a problem that I think the financial industry will face
00:30:48 more and more because a lot of our risk models for instance are built around identity payments ultimately comes down
00:30:55 to identity and you can imagine a world where all this conversation around deep fakes goes towards the direction of
00:31:05 driver's license or passports or state identities and people construct identities in order to get
00:31:12 through a system such as ours to start accepting credit cards or into the cash shop and those technologies seem to be
00:31:20 moving very very quickly our ability to detect them I think is probably lagging at this point but certainly with more
00:31:33 focus we can get ahead of it but this is going to touch everything so I think it's it's it's like security and we're
00:31:40 never going to be able to build a perfect detection system we're only going to be able to you know what we
00:31:49 should be focused on this is the speed of evolving it and being able to take signals that show correctness or errors
00:32:00 as quickly as possible and move and to be able to build that into our newer models or the or the self learning
00:32:06 models you have other worries like some people like Elon and others have worries of existential threats of artificial
00:32:12 intelligence of artificial general intelligence or if you think more narrowly of all threats and concerns
00:32:20 about more narrow artificial intelligence like what are your thoughts in this domain do you have concerns are
00:32:28 you more optimistic I think you've all and his in this book 21 boilin lessons for the 21st century yeah his last
00:32:36 chapters around meditation and you look at the title of the chapter and you're like oh it's kind of old meditation but
00:32:43 the was interesting about that chapter is he believes that you know kids being born today growing up today Google has a
00:32:58 stronger sense of their preferences than they do which you can easily imagine I can easily imagine today that Google
00:33:07 probably knows my preference is more than my mother does maybe not me per se but for someone growing up only knowing
00:33:17 you know not only knowing what Google is capable of or Facebook or Twitter or square or any of these things
00:33:27 the self-awareness is being offloaded to other systems and particularly these these algorithms and his concern is that
00:33:37 we lose that self-awareness because the self-awareness is now outside of us and it's doing such a better job at helping
00:33:45 us direct our decisions around should I stand should I walk today what doctor should I choose who should I date all
00:33:52 these things were now seeing play out very quickly so he sees meditation as a tool to build the self awareness and to
00:34:01 bring the focus back on why do I make these decisions why do I react in this way why did I have this thought where
00:34:07 did that come from that's the way to regain control or awareness maybe not control but put
00:34:14 awareness so that you can be aware that yes I am offloading this decision to this algorithm that I don't fully
00:34:23 understand and can't tell me why it's doing the things that's doing because it's so complex that's not to say that
00:34:29 the algorithm can't be a good thing and to me recommender systems the best of what they can do is to help guide you on
00:34:37 a journey of learning new ideas of learning period it can be a great thing but do you know you're doing that are
00:34:44 you aware that you're inviting it to do that to you I think that's that's a little risky identifies right is that's
00:34:53 perfectly okay but are you aware that you have that invitation and it's it's being acted upon and so that that's your
00:35:01 that's a concern you're kind of highlighting that without a lack of awareness you can just be like floating
00:35:08 at sea so awareness is key in just the future these artificial intelligence systems in the other movie wall-e well
00:35:14 Richard I think is one of Pixar's best movies besides ratatouille right you had me until the ratatouille okay that error is
00:35:27 incredible all right we've come to the first point where we disagree okay the entrepreneurial story in the
00:35:32 form of a wrath mm-hmm I just remember just the soundtrack was really good so excellent
00:35:42 what are your thoughts sticking on artificial intelligence a little bit about the displacement of jobs that's
00:35:48 another perspective that candidates like Andrew yang talked about in getting forever yang Yang so he unfortunately
00:35:56 speaking of yang Yang has recently dropped out I know it was very disappointing and depressing
00:36:02 yeah but the on the positive side he's I think launching a podcast so really cool yeah that's he just announced that I'm
00:36:09 sure he'll try to talk you into trying to come on to the podcast so about Reddit Tori yeah maybe he'll be more
00:36:17 welcoming of the ratatouille argument what are your thoughts on his concerns of the displacement of jobs of
00:36:23 automations of the of course there's positive impacts that could come from automation in the eye and but there
00:36:29 could also be negative impacts and within that framework what are your thoughts about universal basic income so
00:36:36 these interesting new ideas of how we can empower people in the economy I I think he was a hundred percent right on
00:36:47 almost every dimension we see this in squares business I mean he identified truck drivers I'm from Missouri and he
00:37:00 certainly pointed to the concern and the issue that people from where I'm from feel every single day that is often
00:37:08 invisible and not talked about enough you know the next big one is cashiers this is where it pertains to squares
00:37:17 business we are seeing more and more of the point-of-sale moved to the individual customers hand in the form of
00:37:25 their phone and apps and pre-order and order ahead we're seeing more kiosks we're seeing more things like Amazon go
00:37:37 and the number of workers in as a cashier and Rito's immense and you know there's there's no real answers on how they
00:37:49 transform their skills and and work and into something else and I think that does lead to a lot of really negative
00:37:57 ramifications and the important point that he brought up around universal basic income is given that this shift is
00:38:05 going to come and given it's going to take time to set people up with new skills and new careers they need to have
00:38:18 a floor to be able to survive and this $1,000 a month is such a floor it's not going to incentivize you to
00:38:25 quit your job because it's not enough but it will enable you to not have to worry as much about just getting on day
00:38:38 to day so that you can focus on what I'm what am I going to do now and what am I going to what skills do I need to
00:38:47 acquire and I think I think that you know a lot of people point to the fact that you know during the industrial age
00:38:54 we we had the same concerns around automation factory lines and everything worked out okay
00:39:02 but the the biggest change is just the velocity and the centralization of a lot of the things that make this work which
00:39:13 is the data and the algorithms that work on this on this data I think the the second biggest scary thing is just how
00:39:23 around AI is just who actually owns the data and who can operate on it and are we able to share the insights from the
00:39:34 data so that we can also build algorithms that help our needs or help our business or what not so that's where
00:39:44 I think regulation could play a strong and positive part first looking at the primitives of AI and the tools we use to
00:39:52 build these services that will ultimately touch every single aspect of the human experience and then how data
00:40:04 where data is owned and how its how its shared so those those are the answers that as a society as a world we need to
00:40:13 have better answers around which we're currently not they're just way too centralized into a few very very large
00:40:20 companies but I think he was spot-on with identifying the problem and proposing solutions that would actually
00:40:28 work at least that we'd learn from that you could expand or evolve but I mean it's I think it's ubi is well well past
00:40:40 its it's do I mean it was certainly trumpeted by Martin Luther King and even even before him as well and like you
00:40:47 said like you know the exact thousand dollar mark might be might not be the correct one but you should take the
00:40:54 stuffs to try to to implement these solutions and see see what works so I think you and I eat some more diets and
00:41:02 at least I was the first time I've heard this yeah so I was doing it first time anyone has said that to me yeah but it's
00:41:12 becoming more and more cool and but I was doing it before was cool so the intermittent fasting and fasting
00:41:18 in general I really enjoyed I love food but I enjoy the the I also love suffering because I'm Russian so fasting
00:41:29 kind of makes you appreciate makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow so but I have a outside the
00:41:37 philosophical stuff I have a more specific question it also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker like
00:41:43 stifling that from a scientific perspective to sit there for many hours and focus deeply maybe you were a hacker
00:41:51 before you were CEO what have you learned about diet lifestyle mindset that helps you maximize mental
00:42:00 performance to be able to focus for this thing deeply in this world of distractions I think I just took it for
00:42:10 granted for too long which aspect just a social structure of we eat three and there's snacks in between and I just
00:42:18 never really asked the question why oh by the way in case people don't know I think a lot of people know who you you
00:42:25 at least you famously eat once a day yeah you still eat once a day yep sooner by the way what made you decide
00:42:33 to eat once a day like cuz to me that was a huge revolution that you don't have to eat breakfast that was like I
00:42:38 felt like I was a rebel like I yeah like abandoned my parents or something and it doesn't an artist when you when you
00:42:43 first like the first week you start doing it feels you kind of like have a superpower yeah then you realize it's
00:42:49 not really a superpower but it I think you realize at least I realize like it just how much is how much our mind
00:43:00 dictates what we're possible of and and sometimes we have structures around us the incentivize like you know there's
00:43:08 three may thing which was purely social structure versus necessity for our health and for our bodies and I I did it
00:43:19 just I started doing it because I played a lot with my diet when I was a kid and I was vegan for two years and just went
00:43:28 all over the place just because I you know a health is the most precious thing we have and none of us really understand
00:43:35 it so being able asked the question through experiments that I can perform on myself and learn about I is
00:43:45 compelling to me and I heard this one guy on the podcast wim HOF who's famous for doing ice baths and holding his
00:43:55 breath and all these things he said he only eats one meal a day I'm like wow that sounds super challenging and
00:44:02 comfortable I'm gonna do it so I I just I learned the most when I make myself I want to say suffer but when I make
00:44:10 myself feel uncomfortable because everything comes to bear in those moments and and you really learn what
00:44:19 your what you're about or what you're not so I been doing that my whole life like when I was a kid I could not like
00:44:28 I could not speak like I had to go to a speech therapist and it made me extremely shy and then one day I
00:44:35 realized I can't keep doing this and I signed up for the for the speech Club and you know it was a the most
00:44:45 uncomfortable thing I could imagine doing getting a topic on a note card having five minutes to write a speech
00:44:53 about whatever that topic is not being able to use the note card while speaking and speaking for five minutes about that
00:45:03 topic so but it just it puts so much it gave me so much perspective around the power of communication around my own
00:45:12 deficiencies and around if I set my mind to do something I'll do it so it gave me a lot more confidence so I see fasting
00:45:19 in the same light this is something that was interesting challenging uncomfortable and has given me so much
00:45:30 learning and benefit as a result and it will lead to other things that I experiment with and play with but um
00:45:37 yeah it does feel a little bit like a superpower sometimes the most boring superpower one can imagine no it's quite
00:45:45 incredible the clarity of mind is it's pretty interesting speaking of suffering you kind of talk
00:45:53 about facing difficult ideas you meditate you think about the broad context of life of our society let me
00:46:02 ask sort of apologize again for the romanticized question but do you ponder your own mortality do you think about
00:46:12 death about the finiteness of human existence when you meditate when you think about it and if you do what how do
00:46:19 you make sense of it that this thing ends well I don't try to make sense of it I do think about it every day I mean
00:46:28 it's it's a daily multiple times a day any afraid of death no I'm not afraid of it I I think it it's a transformation I
00:46:38 don't know to what but it's also a tool to feel the importance of every moment so I just use as a reminder like I have an hour
00:46:50 is this really what I'm going to spend the hour doing like I only have so many more sunsets and sunrises to watch like
00:46:58 I'm not going to get up for it I'm not going to make sure that I that I that I try to see it so it's it just puts a lot
00:47:07 into perspective and it helps me prioritize I think it's I don't I don't see it as something that's like that I
00:47:16 dread or is dreadful it it's a it's a tool that is available to every single person to use every day because it shows
00:47:22 how precious life is and there's reminders every single day whether it be your own health or a friend or a
00:47:28 co-worker or something you see in the news so it's to me it's just a question of what we do with that daily reminder
00:47:38 and for me it's am I really focused on what matters and sometimes that might be work sometimes that might be
00:47:45 friendships or family or relationships or whatnot but that that's it's the ultimate clarifier in that sense so on
00:47:53 the question of what matters another ridiculously big question of once you try to make sense of it what do you
00:48:00 think is the meaning of it all the meaning of life what gives you purpose happiness meaning
00:48:10 a lot does I mean I mean just being able to be aware of the fact that I'm alive is pretty pretty meaningful the
00:48:22 connections I feel with individuals whether they people I just meet or long lasting friendships or my family is
00:48:32 meaningful seeing people use something that I helped build it is really meaningful and powerful to me but but
00:48:40 that sense of I mean I think ultimately comes down in a sense of connection and just feeling like I am bigger I am part
00:48:49 of something that's bigger than myself and like I can feel it directly in small ways or large ways
00:48:57 however manifest this is probably  it's probably a last question do you think we're living in a simulation I
00:49:07 don't know it's a pretty fun one if we are but also crazy and random and brought with tons of problems but yeah
00:49:18 would you have it any other way yeah I mean I just think it's taken us way too long to as a planet to realize
00:49:27 we're all in this together and we all are connected in in in very significant ways I think we we hide our connectivity
00:49:39 very well through ego through you know whatever or whatever it is of the day but that is the one thing I would want
00:49:49 to work towards changing and that's how I would have it another way because if if we can't do that then how we're going
00:49:54 to connect to all the other simulations because that's the next step is like what's happening in the other simulation
00:50:03 escaping this one and yeah spanning across the multiple simulations and sharing it and on the fun I don't think
00:50:10 there's a better way to end it Jack thank you so much for all the work you do there's probably other ways that
00:50:14 we've ended this and other simulations that may have been better well that's a wait and see thanks so much for talking
