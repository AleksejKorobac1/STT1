00:01:48 seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world and now here's my conversation with Grant Sanderson
00:01:58 if there's intelligent life out there in the universe do you think their mathematics is different than ours
00:02:06 jumping right in I think it's probably very different there's an obvious sense the notation is different right I think
00:02:13 notation can guide what the math itself is I think it has everything to do with the form of their existence right do you
00:02:20 think they have basic arithmetic sorry interrupt yeah so I think they count right I think notions like 1 2 3 the
00:02:26 natural numbers that's extremely well natural that's almost why we put that name to it as soon as you can count you
00:02:33 have a notion of repetition right because you can count by two two times or three times and so you have this
00:02:40 notion of repeating the idea of counting which brings you addition and multiplication I think the way that we
00:02:47 extend to the real numbers there's a little bit of choice in that so there's this funny number system called the
00:02:54 serial numbers that it captures the idea of continuity it's a distinct mathematical object you could very well
00:03:00 you know model the universe and motion of planets with that as the backend of your math right and you still have kind
00:03:07 of the same interface with the front end of what physical laws you're trying to or what physical phenomena you're trying
00:03:14 to describe with math and I wonder if the little glimpses that we have of what choices you can make along the way based
00:03:19 on what different mathematicians have brought to the table is just scratching the surface surface of what the
00:03:24 different possibilities are if you have a completely different mode of thought right or a mode of interacting with the
00:03:31 universe and you think notation is the key part of the journey that we've taken through math I think that's the most
00:03:35 salient part that you'd notice at first I think the mode of thought is going to influence things more than like the
00:03:41 notation itself but notation actually carries a lot of weight when it comes to how we think about things more so than
00:03:47 we usually give it credit for I would I would be comfortable saying give a favor or least favorite piece of notation in
00:03:53 terms of its effectiveness yes yeah well so at least favorite one that I've been thinking a lot about that will be a
00:03:58 video I don't know when but we'll see the number e we write the function e to the X this general exponential function
00:04:06 with a notation e to the X that implies you should think about a particular number this constant of nature
00:04:11 you repeatedly multiply it by itself and then you say well what's e to the square root of two and you're like oh well
00:04:16 we've extended the idea of repeated multiplication that's and that's all nice that's all nice and well but very
00:04:21 famously you have like e to the PI you're like well we're extending the idea of repeated multiplication into the
00:04:27 complex numbers yeah you can think about it that way in reality I think that it's just the wrong way of notationally
00:04:34 representing this function the exponential function which itself could be represented a number of different
00:04:39 ways you can think about it in terms of the problem it solves a certain very simple differential equation which often
00:04:46 yields way more insight than trying to twist to the idea of repeated multiplication like take its arm and put
00:04:51 it behind its back and throw it on the desk and be like you will apply to complex numbers right that's not I don't
00:04:56 think that's pedagogically helpful and so the repeater multiplication is actually missing the main point the
00:05:03 power of e to the S I mean what it addresses is things where the rate at which something changes depends on its
00:05:10 own value but more specifically it depends on it linearly so for example if you have like a population that's
00:05:16 growing and the rate at which it grows depends on how many members of the population are already there it looks
00:05:21 like this nice exponential curve it makes sense to talk about repeated multiplication because you say how much
00:05:25 is there after one year two years three years you're multiplying by something the relationship can be a little bit
00:05:29 different sometimes where let's say you've got a ball on a string like a like a game of tetherball going around a
00:05:39 rope right and you say it's velocity is always perpendicular to its position that's another way of describing its
00:05:45 rate of change is being related to where it is but it's a different operation you're not scaling it it's a rotation
00:05:51 it's this 90 degree rotation that's what the whole idea of like complex exponentiation is trying to capture but
00:05:57 it's obfuscated in the notation when what it's actually saying like if you really parse something like e to the PI
00:06:03 I what it's saying is choose an origin always move perpendicular to the vector from that origin to you okay
00:06:12 then when you walk PI times that radius you'll be halfway around like that's what it's saying it's kind of the u-turn
00:06:19 90 degrees and you walk you'll be going in a circle that's the phenomenon that it's describing but trying
00:06:24 to twist the idea of repeatedly multiplying a constant into that like I I can't even think of the number of
00:06:31 human hours of like intelligent human hours that have been wasted trying to parse that to their own liking and
00:06:38 desire among like scientists or electrical engineers if students have we were which if the notation were a little
00:06:43 different or the way that this whole function was introduced from the get-go were framed differently I think could
00:06:50 have been avoided right and you're talking about the most beautiful equation in mathematics but it's still
00:06:55 pretty mysterious isn't it like you're making it seem like it's a notational it's not mysterious I think I think the
00:07:02 notation makes it mysterious I don't think it's I think the fact that it represents it's pretty it's not like the
00:07:06 most beautiful thing in the world but it's quite pretty the idea that if you take the linear operation of a 90 degree
00:07:13 rotation and then you do this general exponentiation thing to it that what you get are all the other kinds of rotation
00:07:21 which is basically to say if you if your velocity vector is perpendicular to your position vector you walk in a circle
00:07:26 that's pretty it's not the most beautiful thing in the world but it's quite pretty
00:07:30 the beauty of it I think comes from perhaps the awkwardness of the notation somehow still nevertheless coming
00:07:36 together nicely because you have like several disciplines coming together in a single equation well in a sense like
00:07:43 historically speaking but that's true you've got so like the number E is significant like it shows up in
00:07:48 probability all the time it like shows up in calculus all the time it is significant you're seeing is sort of
00:07:53 mated with PI this geometric constant and I like the imaginary number and such I think what's really happening there is
00:08:00 the the way that a shows up is when you have things like exponential growth and decay right it's when this relation that
00:08:06 that something's rate of change has to itself is a simple scaling right a similar law also describes circular
00:08:16 motion because we have bad notation we use the residue of how it shows up in the context of self-reinforcing growth
00:08:22 like a population growing or compound interest the constant associated with that is awkwardly placed into the context of how
00:08:30 rotation comes about because they both come from pretty similar equations and so what we see is the e and the pi juxtaposed
00:08:38 a little bit closer than they would be with a purely natural representation I would think
00:08:42 here's how I would describe the relation between the two you've got a very important function we might call X
00:08:46 that's like the exponential function when you plug in one you get this nice constant called EE that shows up in like
00:08:53 probability and calculus if you try to move in the imaginary direction it's periodic and the period is tau so those
00:09:00 are these two constants associated with this the same central function but for kind of unrelated reasons right and not
00:09:07 unrelated but like orthogonal reasons one of them is what happens when you're moving in the real direction one's what
00:09:11 happens when you move in the imaginary direction and like yeah those are related they're not as related as the
00:09:18 famous equation seems to think it is it's sort of putting all of the children in one bed and they kind of like to
00:09:22 sleep in separate beds if they have the choice but you see them all there and you know there is a family resemblance
00:09:28 but it's not that close so actually think of it as a function is  this is the better idea and that's a
00:09:37 notational idea and yeah and like here's the thing the constant e sort of stands is this numerical representative of
00:09:44 calculus right yeah calculus is the like study of change mm-hmm so it's very at least there's a
00:09:50 little cognitive dissonance using a constant to represent the science of change never thought of it that way yeah
00:09:59 yeah it makes sense why the notation came about that way yes because this is the first way that we saw it in the
00:10:03 context of things like population growth or compound interest it is nicer to think about as repeated multiplication
00:10:09 that's definitely nicer but it's more that that's the first application of what turned out to be a much more
00:10:14 general function that maybe the intelligent life your initial question asked about would have come to recognize
00:10:19 as being much more significant than the single use case which lends itself to repeated multiplication notation but let
00:10:28 me jump back for a second to aliens and the nature of our universe okay do you think math is discovered or invented so
00:10:36 we're talking about the different kind of mathematics that could be developed by the alien species the implied
00:10:45 question is is yeah it's math discovered or invented is you know is fundamentally everybody going to discover
00:10:53 the same principles of mathematics so the way I think about it and everyone thinks about it differently but here's
00:10:56 my take I think there's a cycle at play where you discover things about the universe
00:11:02 that tell you what math will be useful and that math itself is invented in a sense but of all the possible maths that
00:11:12 you could have invented it's discoveries about the world that tell you which ones are so like a good example here is the
00:11:18 Pythagorean theorem when you look at this do you think of that as a definition or do you think of that as a
00:11:22 discovery from the historical perspective right a discovery because there were but that's probably because
00:11:29 they were using physical object to build their intuition and from that intuition came the mathematics so the mathematics
00:11:37 was some abstract world detached from physics but I think more and more math has become detached from you know we
00:11:46 when you even look at modern physics from string theory so even general relativity I mean all math behind the
00:11:54 20th and 21st century physics kind of takes a brisk walk outside of what our mind can actually even comprehend
00:12:02 in multiple dimensions for example anything beyond three dimensions maybe four dimensions no higher dimensions can
00:12:09 be highly highly applicable I think this is a common misinterpretation the if you're asking questions about like a
00:12:15 five dimensional manifold that the only way that that's connected to the physical world is if the physical world
00:12:21 is itself a five dimensional manifold or includes them wait wait wait a minute wait a minute you're telling me you can
00:12:31 imagine a five dimensional manifold no no that's not what I said I I'm I would make the claim that it is useful to a
00:12:36 three dimensional physical universe despite itself not being three dimensional so it's useful meaningful
00:12:41 even understand a three dimensional world it would be useful to have five dimensional manifolds yes absolutely
00:12:47 because of state spaces but you're saying there in some in some deep way for us humans it does it does always
00:12:52 come back to that three dimensional world for the useful usefulness that the dimensional world and therefore it
00:13:00 starts with a discovery but then we invent the mathematics that helps us make sense of the discovery in
00:13:07 a sense yes I mean just to jump off of the Pythagorean theorem it feels like a discovery you've got these beautiful
00:13:13 geometric proofs where you've got squares and you're modifying there is it feels like a discovery if you look at
00:13:19 how we formalize the idea of 2d space as being r2 right all pairs of real numbers and how we define a metric on it and
00:13:26 define distance okay hang on a second we've defined distance so that the Pythagorean theorem is true so then
00:13:32 suddenly it doesn't feel that great but I think what's going on is the thing that informed us what metric to put on
00:13:40 r2 to put on our abstract representation of 2d space came from physical observations and the thing is there's
00:13:45 other metrics you could have put on it we could have consistent math with other notions of distance it's just that those
00:13:51 pieces of math wouldn't be applicable to the physical world that we study because they're not the ones where the
00:13:56 Pythagorean theorem holds so we have a discovery a genuine bona fide discovery that informed the invention the
00:14:02 invention of an abstract representation of 2d space that we call r2 and things like that and then from there you just
00:14:09 study r2 is an abstract thing that brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries which themselves might
00:14:14 yield discoveries those discoveries might give you insight as to what else would be useful to invent and it kind of
00:14:21 feeds on itself that way that's how I think about it so it's not an either/or it's not that math is one of these or
00:14:27 it's one of the others at different times it's playing a different role so then let me ask the the Richard Fineman
00:14:36 question then along that thread is what do you think is a difference between physics and math there's a giant overlap
00:14:45 there's a kind of intuition that physicists have about the world that's perhaps outside of mathematics it's this
00:14:52 mysterious art that they seem to possess we humans generally possess and then there's the beautiful rigour of
00:15:00 mathematics that allows you to I mean just like what as we were saying invent frameworks of understanding our
00:15:09 physical world so what do you think is the difference there and how big is it well I think of math as being the study
00:15:15 of like abstractions over patterns and pure in logic and then physics is obviously grounded in a desire to understand the
00:15:22 world that we live in yeah I think you're going to get very different answers when you talk to different
00:15:26 mathematicians because there's a wide diversity and types of mathematicians there are some who are motivated very
00:15:31 much by pure puzzles they might be turned on by things like combinatorics and they just love the idea of building
00:15:37 up a set of problem-solving tools applying to pure patterns right there are some who are very physically
00:15:46 motivated who who tried to invent new math or discover math in veins that they know will have applications to physics
00:15:52 or sometimes computer science and that's what drives them right like chaos theory is a good example of something that it's
00:15:57 pure math that's purely mathematical a lot of the statements being made but it's heavily motivated by specific
00:16:05 applications to largely physics and then you have a type of mathematician who just loves abstraction they just love
00:16:10 pulling into the more and more abstract things the things that feel powerful these are the ones that initially
00:16:15 invented like topology and then later on get really into category theory and go on about like infinite categories and
00:16:21 whatnot these are the ones that love to have a system that can describe truths about as many things as possible right
00:16:30 people from those three different veins of motivation into math are going to give you very different answers about
00:16:34 what the relation at play here is because someone like flightmare Arnold who is this he's written a lot of great
00:16:41 books many about like differential equations and such he would say math is a branch of physics that's how he would
00:16:47 think about it and of course he was studying like differential equations related things because that is the
00:16:52 motivator behind the study of PDEs and things like that well you'll have others who like especially the category
00:16:59 theorists who aren't really thinking about physics necessarily it's all about abstraction and the power of generality
00:17:05 and it's more of a happy coincidence that that ends up being useful for understanding the world we live in and
00:17:12 then you can get into like why is that the case that's sort of surprising that that which is about pure puzzles and
00:17:20 abstraction also happens to describe the very fundamentals of quarks and everything else so what do you think the
00:17:28 fundamentals of quarks and and the nature of reality is so compressible and too clean beautiful
00:17:36 equations that are for the most part simple relatively speaking a lot simpler than they could be so you have we
00:17:44 mentioned somebody like Stephen Wolfram who thinks that sort of there's incredibly simple rules underlying our
00:17:53 reality but it can create arbitrary complexity but there is simple equations what I'm asking a million questions that
00:18:02 nobody knows the answer to but no idea why is it simple I it could be the case that there's like a filter iteration I
00:18:09 played the only things that physicists find interesting other ones little simple enough they could describe it
00:18:13 mathematically but as soon as it's a sufficiently complex system like now that's outside the realm of physics
00:18:19 that's biology or whatever have you and of course that's true all right you know maybe there's something what's like of
00:18:25 course there will always be some thing that is simple when you wash away the like non important parts of whatever it
00:18:33 is that you're studying just some like an information theory standpoint there might be some like you you get to the
00:18:39 lowest information component of it but I don't know maybe I'm just having a really hard time conceiving of what it
00:18:44 would even mean for the fundamental laws to be like intrinsically complicated like some some set of equations that you
00:18:52 can't decouple from each other well no it could be it could be that sort of we take for granted that they're the the
00:19:01 laws of physics for example are for the most part the same everywhere or something like that right as opposed to
00:19:10 the sort of an alternative could be that the rules under which are the world operates is different everywhere it's
00:19:20 like a like a deeply distributed system or just everything is just chaos like not not in a strict definition of cast
00:19:28 but meaning like just it's impossible for equations to capture for to explicitly model the world as cleanly as
00:19:37 the physical does any we're almost take it for granted that we can describe we can have an equation for gravity
00:19:43 for action in a distance we can have equations for some of these basic ways the planets moving just the the
00:19:52 low-level at the atomic scale all the materials operate at the high scale how black holes operate but it doesn't it it
00:20:00 seems like it could be there's infinite other possibilities where none of it could be compressible into such equation
00:20:07 so it just seems beautiful it's also weird probably to the point you're making that it's very pleasant that this
00:20:15 is just for our minds right so it might be that our minds are biased to just be looking at the parts of the universe
00:20:22 that are compressible and then we can publish papers on and have nice e equals mc-squared equations right well I wonder
00:20:30 would such a world with uncompressible laws allow for the kind of beings that can think about the kind of questions
00:20:38 that you're asking that's true right like an anthropic principle coming into play at some weird way here I don't know
00:20:44 like I don't know what I'm talking about it or maybe the universe is actually not so compressible but the way our brain
00:20:52 the the way our brain evolved were only able to perceive the compressible parts I mean we are so this is a sort of
00:20:59 Chomsky argument we are just the sentence of apes over like really limited biological systems so totally
00:21:05 make sense there were really limited little computers calculators that are able to perceive certain kinds of things
00:21:11 in the actual world is much more complicated well but we can we can do pretty awesome things right like we can
00:21:20 fly spaceships and that we have to have some connection of reality to be able to take our potentially oversimplified
00:21:26 models of the world but then actually twist the world to our will based on it so we have certain reality checks that
00:21:33 like physics isn't too far afield simply based on what we can do and the fact that we can fly is pretty good it's
00:21:43 great the laws were working with our are working well so I mentioned to the internet that I'm talking to you and so
00:21:50 the internet gave some questions so I apologize for these but do you think we're living in a simulation
00:21:57 that the universe is a computer or the universe is the computation running a computer it's conceivable what I don't
00:22:05 buy is you know you'll have the argument that well let's say that it was the case that you can have simulations then the
00:22:13 simulated world would itself eventually get to a point where it's running simulations yes and then the the second
00:22:18 layer down would create a third layer down and on and on and on so probabilistically you just throw a dart
00:22:22 at one of those layers we're probably in one of the simulated layers I think if there's some sort of limitations
00:22:28 unlike the information processing of whatever the physical world is like it quickly becomes the case that you have a
00:22:35 limit to the layers that could exist there because like the resources necessary to simulate a universe like
00:22:42 ours clearly is a lot just in terms of the number of bits at play and so then you can ask well what's more plausible
00:22:49 that there's an unbounded capacity of information processing in whatever they like highest up level universe is or
00:22:55 that there's some bound to that capacity which then limits like the number of levels available how do you play some
00:23:01 kind of probability distribution on like what the information capacity is I have no idea but I I don't mean like people
00:23:07 almost assume a certain uniform probability over all of those metal layers that could conceivably exist when
00:23:14 it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager on like you're not giving a low enough prior to the mere existence of that
00:23:21 infinite set of layers yeah that's true but it's also very difficult to contextualize the amount so the amount
00:23:28 of information processing power required to simulate like our universe seems like amazingly huge what you can always raise
00:23:38 two to the power of that exactly yeah like numbers bit big and we're easily humbled but basically everything around
00:23:47 us so it's very difficult to to kind of make sense of anything actually when you look up at the sky and look at the stars
00:23:54 in the immensity of it all to make sense of us the smallness of us the unlikeliness of everything that's on
00:24:02 this earth coming to be then you could basically anything could be all laws of probability go out the window
00:24:13 to me because I guess because the amount of information under which we're operating is very low we basically know
00:24:21 nothing about the world around us relatively speaking and so so when I think about the simulation hypothesis I
00:24:29 think is just fun to think about it but it's also I think there is a thought experiment kind of interesting to think
00:24:35 of the power of computation where there are the limits of a Turing machine sort of the limits of our current computers
00:24:42 when you start to think about artificial intelligence how far can we get with computers and that's kind of where the
00:24:51 simulation hypothesis useless me as a thought experiment is is the universe just the computer is it just the
00:24:59 computation is all of this just the computation and so the same kind of tools we apply to analyzing algorithms
00:25:05 can that be applied you know if we scale further and further and further well the arbitrary power of those
00:25:10 systems start to create some interesting aspects that we see in our universe or something fundamentally different needs
00:25:19 to be created well it's interesting that in our universe it's not arbitrarily large the power that you can place
00:25:24 limits on for example how many bits of information can be stored per unit area right like all of the physical laws
00:25:31 we've got general relativity and like quantum coming together to give you a certain limit on how many bits you can
00:25:38 store within a given range before it collapses into a black hole like the idea that there even exists such a limit
00:25:43 is that the very least thought-provoking when naively you might assume oh well you know technology could always get
00:25:49 better and better we could get cleverer and cleverer and you could just cram as much information as you want into like a
00:26:00 small unit of space that makes me think it's at least plausible that whatever the highest level of existence is
00:26:10 doesn't admit too many simulations or ones that are at the scale of complexity that we're looking at obviously it's
00:26:15 just as conceivable that they do and that there are many but I I guess what I'm channeling is the surprise that I felt
00:26:23 learning that fact that there are the information is physical in this way is that there's a finance to it okay let me
00:26:29 just even go off on that from mathematics perspective and the psychology perspective how do you mix
00:26:38 are you psychologically comfortable with the concept of infinity I think so are you okay with it I'm pretty okay
00:26:45 yeah okay no not really it doesn't make any sense to me I don't know like how many how many
00:26:51 words how many possible words do you think could exist that are just like strings of letters so that that's a sort
00:26:59 of mathematical statement as beautiful and we use infinity basically everything we do everything we do inside in science
00:27:08 math and engineering yes but you said exist my the question is well you said letters of words
00:27:17 I said words words the to bring words into existence to me you have to start like saying them or like writing them or
00:27:22 like listing them that's an instantiation okay combination how many abstract words exist it was the idea of
00:27:29 abstract yeah the the idea of abstract notions and ideas I think we should be clear around terminology I mean you
00:27:35 think about intelligence a lot like artificial intelligence would you not say that what it's doing is a kind of abstraction
00:27:42 they're like abstraction is key to conceptualizing the universe you get this raw sensory data you need I need
00:27:48 something that every time you move your face a little bit and the they're not pixels but like analog of pixels on my
00:27:55 retina change entirely yeah that I can still have some coherent notion of this is Lex and planet Lex yes right what
00:28:01 that requires is you have a disparate set of possible images hitting me that are unified in a notion of Lex yeah
00:28:08 right that's a kind of abstraction it's a thing that could apply to a lot of different images that I see and it
00:28:14 represents it in a much more compressed way and one that's like much more resilient to that I think in the same
00:28:20 way if I'm talking about infinity as an abstraction I don't mean non-physical woowoo it like ineffable or something what I
00:28:28 mean is it something that can apply to a multiplicity of situations that share certain common attribute in the same way
00:28:33 that the images of like your face on my retina Sharon common attributes that I can put the
00:28:39 single notion to it like in that way infinity is an abstraction and it's very powerful and and it's a it's only
00:28:44 through such abstraction that we can actually understand like the world and logic and things and in the case of
00:28:49 infinity the way I think about it the key entity is the property of always being able to add one more like no
00:28:56 matter how many words you can list you just throw an A at the end of one and you have another conceivable word you
00:29:01 don't have to think of all the words at once it's that property the oh I could always add one more that gives it this nature
00:29:08 of infinite enos in the same way that they're certain like properties of your face that give it the Lexx miss right so
00:29:15 like infinity should be no more worrying than the I can always add one more sentiment that's a really elegant much
00:29:23 more elegant way than I could put it so thank you for doing that as yet another abstraction and yes indeed that's what
00:29:30 our brain does that's what intelligence systems do this what programming does that's what science does is build
00:29:36 abstraction on top of each other and yet there is at a certain point abstractions that go into the quote whoo right sort
00:29:48 of and because we're now it's like it's like we built this stack of you know the the only thing that's true is the stuff
00:29:55 that's on the ground everything else is useful for interpreting this and at a certain point you might start floating
00:30:04 into ideas that are surreal and difficult and and take us into areas that are disconnected from reality in a
00:30:11 way that we could never give back what if instead of calling these abstract how different would it be in your mind if we
00:30:16 call them general and the phenomenon that you're describing is over generalization when you try them
00:30:21 channelization yeah have a concept or an idea that's so general as to apply to nothing in particular in a useful way
00:30:28 does that map to what you're thinking of when you think of first of all I'm playing a little just for the fun of it
00:30:33 yeah and that devil's advocate and  I I think our cognition our mind is unable to visualize so you do some incredible
00:30:42 work with visualization and video I think infinity is very difficult to visualize for our mind
00:30:51 we can delude ourselves into thinking we can visualize it but we can't I don't that means I don't I would venture to
00:30:58 say it's very difficult and so there's some concepts of mathematics like maybe multiple dimensions we could sort of
00:31:05 talk about that are impossible for us to truly into it like and it just feels dangerous to me to use these as part of
00:31:17 our toolbox of abstractions on behalf of your listeners I almost fear we're getting too philosophical oh no I I
00:31:25 think to that point for any particular idea like this there's multiple angles of attack
00:31:30 I think the when we do visualize infinity what we're actually doing you know you write dot dot dot one two three
00:31:37 four dot dot right that's those are symbols on the page that are insinuating a certain infinity what you're capturing
00:31:47 with a little bit of design there is the I can always add one more property right I think I'm just as uncomfortable with
00:31:52 you are if you try to concretize it so much that you have a bag of infinitely many things
00:32:00 that I actually think of no not one two three four dot dot dot one two three four five six seven eight I try to get
00:32:05 them all and I had and you realize oh I you know your your brain would literally collapse into a black hole all of that
00:32:12 and and I honestly feel this with a lot of math that I tried to read where I I don't think of myself as like
00:32:19 particularly good at math in some ways like I get very confused often when I am going through some of these texts and
00:32:25 often when I'm feeling my head is like this is just so damn have strict I just can't wrap my head around I just wanted
00:32:31 to put something concrete to it that makes me understand and I think a lot of the motivation for the channel is
00:32:38 channeling that sentiment of yeah a lot of the things that you're trying to read out there it's just so hard to connect
00:32:44 to anything that you spend an hour banging your head against a couple of pages and you come out not really
00:32:50 knowing anything more other than some definitions maybe and a certain sense of self defeat right one of the reasons I
00:32:58 focus so much on visualizations is that I'm a big believer in I'm sorry I'm just really hampering out
00:33:04 this idea of abstraction being clear about your layers of abstraction yes right it's always tempting to start an
00:33:11 explanation from the top to the bottom yeh you you give the definition of a new theorem you're like this is the
00:33:16 definition of a vector space for example we're gonna that's how well start of course these are the properties of a
00:33:21 vector space Yuma first from these properties we will derive what we need in order to do the math of linear
00:33:27 algebra or whatever it might be I don't think that's how understanding works at all I think how understanding works is
00:33:32 you start at the lowest level you can get it where rather than thinking about a vector space you might think of
00:33:37 concrete vectors that are just lists of numbers or picturing it as like an arrow that you draw which is itself like even
00:33:45 less abstract the numbers because you're looking at quantities like the distance of the x-coordinate the distance of the
00:33:49 y-coordinate it's as concrete as you could possibly get and it has to be if you're putting it in a visual right like
00:33:56 that it's an actual arrow it's an actual vector you're not talking about like a quote-unquote vector that could apply to
00:34:02 any possible thing you have to choose one if you're illustrating it and I think this is the power of being in a
00:34:08 medium like video or if you're writing a textbook and you force yourself to put a lot of images is with every image you're
00:34:15 making a choice with each choice you're showing a concrete example with each concrete example you're eating someone's
00:34:21 path to understanding you know I'm sorry to interrupt you but you just made me realize that that's exactly right so the
00:34:28 visualization is you're creating while you're sometimes talking about abstractions the actual visualization is
00:34:36 a explicit low-level example yes so there there's an actual like in the code you have to say what the what the vector
00:34:43 is what's the direction of the arrow what's the magnitude of the yeah so that's you're going the visualization
00:34:50 itself is actually going to the bottom I think and I think that's very important I also think about this a lot in writing
00:34:56 scripts where even before you get to the visuals the first instinct is to I don't know why I just always do I say the
00:35:03 abstract thing I say the general definition the powerful thing and then I fill it in with examples later always it
00:35:09 will be more compelling and easier to understand when you flip that and instead you let someone's brain do the
00:35:16 pattern recognition you just show them a bunch of examples the brain is gonna feel a certain similarity between them
00:35:22 then by the time you bring in the definition or by the time you bring in the formula its articulating a thing
00:35:29 that's already in the brain that was built off of looking at a bunch of examples with a certain kind of
00:35:34 similarity and what the formula does is articulate what that kind of similarity is rather than being a high cognitive
00:35:42 load set of symbols that needs to be populated with examples later on assuming someone still with you what is
00:35:51 the most beautiful or on inspiring idea you've come across in mathematics I don't know maybe it's an ID you've
00:35:58 explored in your videos maybe not what mike just gave you pause it's the most beautiful idea small or big so I think
00:36:06 often the things that are most beautiful are the ones that you have like a little bit of understanding of but certainly
00:36:14 not an entire understanding it's a little bit of that mystery that is what makes it beautiful almost a moment of
00:36:20 the discovery for you personally almost just that leap of haha moment so something that really caught my eye I
00:36:27 remember when I was little there were these I come I think the series was called like wooden books or something
00:36:33 these tiny little books that would have just a very short description of something on the left and then a picture
00:36:37 on the right I don't know who they're meant for but maybe it's like loosely children or something like that but it
00:36:41 can't just be children because of some of the things I was describing on the last page of one of them some were tiny
00:36:48 in there was this little formula the on the left hand had a sum over all of the natural numbers you know it's like 1
00:36:54 over 1 to the s plus 1 over 2 to the s plus 1 over 3 to the s on and on to the infinity then on the other side had a
00:37:01 product over all of the primes and it was a certain thing I had to do with all the primes and like any good young math
00:37:07 enthusiast I'd probably been indoctrinated with how chaotic and confusing the primes are which they are
00:37:13 and seeing this equation where on one site you have something that's as understandable as you could possibly get
00:37:18 the counting numbers yes and on the other side is all the prime numbers it was like this whoa they're related like
00:37:24 this there's there's a simple description that includes like all the primes getting wrapped together
00:37:30 this this is like the Euler product for zeta function as I like later found out the equation itself essentially encodes
00:37:37 the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that every number can be expressed as a unique set of primes to me still there's
00:37:44 I mean I certainly don't understand this equation or this function all that well the more I learn about it the prettier
00:37:52 it is the idea that you can this is sort of what gets you representations of primes not in terms of Prime's
00:37:58 themselves but in terms of another set of numbers they're like the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function and again I'm
00:38:04 very kind of in over my head in a lot of ways as I like try to get to understand it but the more I do its it always
00:38:10 leaves enough mystery that it remains very beautiful to me so whenever there's a little bit of mystery just outside of
00:38:17 the understanding that and by the way the process of learning more about it how does that come about just your own
00:38:24 thought or are you reading reading yes or is the visualization itself revealing more to you visuals help I mean in one
00:38:30 time when I was just trying to understand like analytic continuation and playing around with visualizing
00:38:37 complex functions this is what led to a video about this function it's titled something like visualizing the riemann
00:38:43 zeta function it's one that came about because i was programming and tried to see what a certain thing looked like and
00:38:49 then i looked at it like well that's elucidating and then i decided to make a video about it but i mean you try to get
00:38:57 your hands on as much reading as you can you you know in this case i think if anyone wants to start to understand it
00:39:05 if they have like a math background of some like they studied some in college or something like that like the
00:39:10 princeton companion to math has a really good article on analytic number theory and that itself has a whole bunch of
00:39:16 references and you know anything has more references and it gives you this like tree to start pawing through and
00:39:22 like you know you try to understand I try to understand things visually as I go that's not always possible but it's
00:39:28 very helpful when it does you recognize when there's common themes like in this case cousins of the Fourier transform I come
00:39:36 into play and you realize oh it's probably pretty important to have deep intuitions of the fourier transform even
00:39:41 if it's not explicitly mentioned in like these texts and you try to get a sense of what the common players are but I'll
00:39:48 emphasize again like I feel very in over my head when I try to understand the exact relation between like the zeros of
00:39:55 the Riemann zeta function and how they relate to the distribution of primes I definitely understand it better than I
00:40:00 did a year ago I definitely understand it 1/100 as well as the experts on the matter do I assume but the slow path
00:40:09 towards getting theirs it's fun it's charming and like to your question very beautiful and the beauty is in the what
00:40:16 in the journey versus the destination well it's that each each thing doesn't feel arbitrary I think that's a big part
00:40:22 is that you have these unpredictable none yeah these very unpredictable patterns were these intricate properties
00:40:30 of like a certain function but at the same time it doesn't feel like humans ever made an arbitrary choice in
00:40:36 studying this particular thing so you know it feels like you're speaking to patterns themselves or nature itself
00:40:43 that's a big part of it I think things that are too arbitrary it's just hard for those to feel beautiful because and
00:40:49 this is sort of what the word contrived is meant to apply to right and the one they're not arbitrary means it could be
00:41:00 you can have a clean abstraction an intuition that allows you to comprehend it well to one of your first questions
00:41:07 it makes you feel like if you came across another intelligent civilization that they'd be studying the same thing
00:41:13 it may be with different notation but personally yeah but yeah like that's what I think you talk to that other
00:41:19 civilization they're probably also studying the zeros of the Riemann zeta function or it's like some variant
00:41:26 thereof that is like a clearly equivalent cousin or something like that but that's probably on their on their
00:41:34 docket whenever somebody does a lot of something amazing I'm gonna ask the question that that you've already been
00:41:41 asked a lot that you'll get more and more asked in your life but what was your favorite video to create
00:41:49 Oh favorite to create one of my favorites is the title is who cares about topology you want me to pull it up
00:41:59 or not if you want sure yeah it is about well it starts by describing an unsolved problem that still unsolved in math
00:42:05 called the inscribed square problem you draw any loop and then you ask are there four points on that loop that make a
00:42:10 square totally useless right this is not answering any physical questions it's mostly interesting that we can't answer
00:42:15 that question and it seems like such a natural thing to ask now if you weaken it a little bit and you ask can you
00:42:23 always find a rectangle you choose four points on this curve can you find a rectangle that's hard but it's doable
00:42:31 and the path to it involves things like looking at a torus this surface with a single hole in it like a donut we're
00:42:37 looking at a mobius strip in ways that feel so much less contrived to when I first as like a little kid learned about
00:42:43 these surfaces and shapes like a mobius strip and a torus like what you learn is oh this mobius strip you take a piece of
00:42:50 paper put a twist glue it together and now you have a shape with one edge and just one side and as a student you
00:42:59 should think who cares right like how does that help me solve any problems I thought math was about problem solving
00:43:05 so what I liked about the piece of math that this was describing that was in this paper by a mathematician named
00:43:12 Vaughan was that it arises very naturally it's clear what it represents it's doing something it's not just
00:43:18 playing with construction paper and the way that it solves the problem is really beautiful so kind of putting all of that
00:43:26 down and concretizing it right like I was talking about how when you have to put visuals to it it demands that what's
00:43:32 on screen is a very specific example of what you're describing the cut the construction here is very abstract in
00:43:37 nature you describe this very abstract kind of surface in 3d space so then when I was finding myself in this case I
00:43:43 wasn't programming I was using Grapher that's like built into OSX for the 3d stuff to draw that surface you realize
00:43:51 oh man the topology argument is very non constructive I have to make a lot of you have to do a lot of extra work in order
00:43:57 to make the surface show up but then once you see it it's quite pretty very satisfying to see a specific
00:44:02 instance of it and you also feel like I've actually added something on top of what the original paper was doing that
00:44:08 it shows something that's completely correct it's a very beautiful argument but you don't see what it looks like and
00:44:15 I found something satisfying and seeing what it looked like that could only ever have come about from the forcing
00:44:20 function of getting some kind of image on the screen to describe the thing I was talking abut your most weren't able
00:44:24 to anticipate what its gonna look like I don't know idea I had no idea and it was wonderful right it was totally it looks
00:44:30 like a Sydney Opera House or some sort of Frank Gehry design and it was you knew it was gonna be something and you
00:44:36 can say various things about it like oh it it touches the curve itself it has a boundary that's this curve on the 2d
00:44:43 plane it all sits above the plane but before you actually draw it so it's very unclear what the thing will look like
00:44:50 and to see it it's very it's just pleasing right so that was that was fun to make very fun to share I hope that it
00:44:57 has elucidated for some people out there where these constructs of topology come from that it's not arbitrary play with
00:45:04 construction paper so that's I think this is good a good sort of example to talk a little bit about your process so
00:45:11 you have you have a list of ideas so that sort of the the curse of having having an active and brilliant mind is
00:45:19 I'm sure you have a list that's growing faster than you can utilize and but there's some sorting procedure depending
00:45:30 on mood and interest and so on but okay so pick an idea then you have to try to write a narrative arc it's sort of how
00:45:39 do I elucidate how how do I make this idea beautiful and clear and explain it and then there's a set of visualizations
00:45:47 that'll be attached to it sort of you've talked about some of this before but sort of writing the story attaching the
00:45:54 visualizations can you talk through interesting painful beautiful parts of that process well the most painful is if
00:46:02 you've chosen a topic that you do want to do but then it's hard to think of I guess how to structure the script this
00:46:10 is sort of where I have been on one for like the last two or three months and I think the ultimately the right resolution
00:46:16 just like set it aside and instead do some other things where the script comes more naturally because you sort of don't
00:46:23 want to overwork a narrative that the more you've thought about it the less you can empathize with the student who
00:46:27 doesn't yet understand the thing you're trying to teach who is the judger in your head sort of
00:46:36 the person the creature the essence that's saying this sucks er this is good and you mentioned kind of the student
00:46:43 you're you're thinking about what can you  who is that what is that thing that's Chris that is the perfections
00:46:50 that says this thing sucks you need to work on it in front of the two three months I don't know I think it's my past
00:46:57 self I think that's the entity that I'm most trying to empathize with is like you take who I was because it's kind of
00:47:02 the only person I know like you don't really know anyone other than versions of yourself so I start with the version
00:47:08 of myself that I know who doesn't yet understand the thing right and then I just try to view it with fresh eyes a
00:47:17 particular visual or a particular script like is this motivating does this make sense which has its downsides because
00:47:24 sometimes I find myself speaking to motivations that only myself would be interested in I don't like it I did this
00:47:31 project on quaternions where what I really wanted was to understand what are they doing in four dimensions can we see
00:47:36 what they're doing in four dimensions right and I can way of thinking about it that really answered the question in my
00:47:44 head that maybe very satisfied and being able to think about concretely with a 3d visual what are they doing to a 4d
00:47:49 sphere and some like great this is exactly what my past self would have wanted right and I make a thing on it
00:47:53 and I'm sure it's what some other people wanted to it but in hindsight I think most people who want to learn about
00:48:00 quaternions are like robotics engineers or graphics programmers who want to understand how they're used to describe
00:48:07 3d rotations and like their use case was actually a little bit different than my past self and in that way like I
00:48:11 wouldn't actually recommend that video to people who are coming at it from that angle of wanting to know hey I'm a
00:48:18 robotics program or like how do these quarter neon things work to describe position in 3d space I would say other
00:48:26 great resources for that if you ever find yourself wanting to say but hang on in what sense are they
00:48:31 acting in four dimensions then come back but until then it's a little different yeah it's interesting because so you
00:48:38 have incredible videos on your networks for example and for my certain perspectives have probably I mean I
00:48:47 looked at the is served my field and I've also looked at the basic introduction of neural networks like a
00:48:51 million times from different perspectives and it made me realize that there's a lot of ways to present it so
00:48:58 you were sort of you did an incredible job I mean sort of the but you could also do it differently and
00:49:07 also incredible like to create a beautiful presentation of a basic concept is requires sort of creativity
00:49:16 requires genius and so on but you can take it from a bunch of different perspectives in that video and you'll
00:49:21 know which mean you realize that and just as you're saying you kind of have a certain mindset a certain view but from
00:49:29 if you take a different view from a physics perspective from a neuroscience perspective talking about neural
00:49:37 networks or from robotics perspective or from let's see from a pure learning statistics perspective so you you can
00:49:46 create totally different videos and you've done that with a few actually concepts where you've have taken
00:49:52 different costs like at the at the at the Euler equation right the you've taken different views of that I think
00:49:58 I've made three videos on it and I definitely will make at least one more never enough never enough so you don't
00:50:05 think it's the most beautiful equation in mathematics no like I said as we represent it it's one of the most
00:50:12 hideous it involves a lot of the most hideous aspects of our notation I talked about II the fact that we use PI instead
00:50:19 of tau the fact that we call imaginary numbers imaginary and then and actually wonder if we use the I because of
00:50:25 imaginary I don't know if that's historically accurate but at least a lot of people they read the eye and they
00:50:31 think imaginary like all three of those facts it's like those are things that have added more confusion than they
00:50:35 needed to and we're wrapping them up in one equation like boy that's just very hideous right the idea is that it does
00:50:41 tie together when you want away the notation look it's okay it's pretty it's nice but it's not like
00:50:48 mind-blowing greatest thing in the universe which is maybe what I was thinking of when I said like once you
00:50:54 understand something it doesn't have the same beauty like I feel like I understand Euler's formula and I feel
00:51:02 like I understand it enough to sort of see the version that just woke up it hasn't really gotten itself dressed
00:51:08 in the morning that's a little bit groggy and there's bags under its eyes so years like it's their past yeah the
00:51:14 the the dating stage you know we're no longer dating right instead of dating Bizet des function this head like she's
00:51:19 beautiful and right and like we have fun and it's that that high dopamine part for like maybe at some point will settle
00:51:26 into the more mundane nature the relationship where I like see her for who she truly is and she'll still be
00:51:30 beautiful in her own way but it won't have the same romantic pizzazz right well that's the nice thing about
00:51:37 mathematics I think as long as you don't live forever there will always be enough mystery and fun with some of the
00:51:44 equations even if you do the rate at which questions comes up is much faster than the rate at which answers come up
00:51:50 so if you could live forever would you I think so yeah do you think you don't think mortality is the thing that makes
00:51:57 life meaningful would your life be four times as meaningful if you died at 25 so this goes to infinity I think you and I
00:52:05 that's really interesting so what I said is infinite not not four times longer mm-hmm I said infinite so the the actual
00:52:15 existence of the finiteness the existence of the end no matter the length is the thing that may sort of
00:52:22 from my comprehension of psychology it's such a deeply human it's such a fundamental part of the human condition
00:52:30 the fact that there is that we're mortal that the the fact that things and they see it seems to be a crucial part of
00:52:39 what gives them meaning I don't think at least for me like it's a very small percentage of my time that mortality is
00:52:46 salient that I'm like aware of the end of my life what do you mean by me I'm trolling is it the ego is that the aid
00:52:54 there's that the super-ego is a so you're the reflective self the Verna Keys area that puts all this stuff into
00:53:01 words yeah a small percentage of your mind that is actually aware of the true motivations that drive you but my point
00:53:08 is that most of my life I'm not thinking about death but I still feel very motivated to like make things and to
00:53:13 like interact with people like experienced love or things like that I'm very motivated and I it's strange that
00:53:20 that motivation comes while death is not in my mind at all and this might just be because I'm young enough that it's not
00:53:25 salient force in your subconscious or that you were instructed an illusion that allows you to escape the fact of
00:53:32 your mortality by enjoying the moment so to the existential approach life would be gun to my head I don't think that's
00:53:39 it yeah another another sort of would say gun to the head it's the deep psychological introspection of what
00:53:46 drives us I mean that's  in some ways to me I mean when I look at math when I look at science is the kind of an escape
00:53:53 from reality in a sense that it's so beautiful it's such a beautiful journey of discovery that it allows you to
00:54:02 actually is it allows you to achieve a kind of immortality of explore ideas and sort of connect yourself to the thing
00:54:12 that is seemingly infinite like the universe right that allows you to escape the the limited nature of our little of
00:54:24 our bodies of our existence what else would give this podcast meaning that's right if not the fact that it will end
00:54:31 this place closes in in 40 minutes and it's so much more meaningful for it how much more I love this room because we'll
00:54:40 be kicked out so I understand just because you're trolling me doesn't mean I'm wrong but I take your point I take
00:54:48 your point boy that would be a good Twitter bio just because you're trolling me doesn't
00:54:56 mean I'm wrong yeah and and sort of difference in backgrounds I'm a bit Russian so we're a bit melancholic and
00:55:03 it seemed to maybe assign a little too much value just suffering immortality and things like that
00:55:09 make makes for a better novel I think oh yeah you need you need some sort of existential threat yeah to drive a plot
00:55:17 so when do you know when the video is done when you're working on it that's pretty easy actually because I'm
00:55:24 you know I'll write the script I want there to be some kind of aha moment in there and then hopefully the script can
00:55:29 revolve around some kind of aha moment and then from there you know you're putting visuals to each sentence that
00:55:35 exists and then you narrate it you edit it all together so given that there's a script the the end becomes quite clear
00:55:43 and you know you're as I as I animated I often change the certainly the specific words but sometimes the structure itself
00:55:51 but it's a very deterministic process at that point it makes it much easier to predict when something will be done how
00:55:57 do you know when a script is done it's like for problem-solving videos that's quite simple it's it's once you feel
00:56:02 like someone who didn't understand the solution now could for things like neural networks that was a lot harder
00:56:06 because like you said there's so many angles at which you could attack it and there it's it's just at some point you
00:56:15 feel like this this asks a meaningful question and it answers that question right what is the best way to learn math
00:56:21 for people who might be at the beginning of that journey I think that's a it's a question that a lot of folks kind of ask
00:56:27 and think about and it doesn't even for folks who are not really at the beginning of their journey like there
00:56:33 might be actually is deep in their career some type they've taken college a taking calculus and so on but still
00:56:39 wanna sort of explore math well what would be your advice instead of education at all ages your temptation
00:56:46 will be to spend more time like watching lectures or reading try to force yourself to do more problems than you
00:56:53 naturally would that's a big one like the the focus time that you're spending should be on like solving specific
00:57:00 problems and seek entities that have well curated lists of problems so go into like a textbook almost in and the
00:57:07 problems in the back of a text and back of a chapter so if you can take a little look through those questions at the end
00:57:11 of the chapter before you read the chapter a lot of them won't make sense some of them might and those are those
00:57:16 are the best ones to think about a lot of them won't but just you know take a quick look and then read a little bit of
00:57:20 the chapter and maybe take a look again and things like that and don't consider yourself
00:57:25 done with the chapter until you've actually worked through a couple exercises right and and this is so
00:57:31 hypocritical right because I like put out videos that pretty much never have associated exercises I just view myself
00:57:37 as a different part of the ecosystem which means I'm kind of admitting that you're not really learning or at least
00:57:44 this is only a partial part of the learning process if you're watching these videos
00:57:49 I think if someone's at the very beginning like I do think Khan Academy does a good job they have a pretty large
00:57:55 set of questions you can work through just a very basic sort of just picking picking out getting getting comfortable
00:58:02 is a very basically algebra calculus fun Khan Academy programming is actually I think a great like learned to program
00:58:08 and like let the way the math is motivated from that angle push you through I know a lot of people who
00:58:15 didn't like math got into programming in some way and that's what turned them on to math maybe I'm biased cuz like I live
00:58:20 in the Bay Area so I'm more likely to run into someone who has that phenotype but I am willing to speculate that that
00:58:28 is a more generalizable path so you yourself kind of in creating the videos are using programming to illuminate a
00:58:35 concept but for yourself as well so would you recommend somebody try to make a sort of almost like try to make videos
00:58:42 like you do what's the one thing I've heard before I don't know if this is based on any actual study this might be
00:58:46 like a total fictional anecdote of numbers but it rings in the mind as being true you remember about 10 percent
00:58:52 of what you read you remember about 20% of what you listen to remember about 70% of what you actively interact with in
00:58:59 some way and then about 90% of what you teach this is a thing I heard again those numbers might be meaningless but
00:59:04 they bring true don't they right I'm willing to say I learned the nine times better than reading that
00:59:12 might even be a lowball yeah right so so doing something to teach or to like actively try to explain things is huge
00:59:17 for consolidating the knowledge outside of family and friends is there a moment you can remember that you would like to
00:59:25 relive because it made you truly happy or it was transformative in some fundamental way a moment that was transformed
00:59:35 or made you truly happy yeah I think there's times like music used to be a much bigger part of my life than it is now
00:59:40 like when I was a let's say a teenager and I can think of sometimes in like playing music there was one way at my
00:59:47 command my brother and a friend of mine this slightly violates the family and friends but there was a music that made
00:59:54 me happy they were just company we like played a gig at a ski resort such that you like take a gondola to the top
01:00:01 and like did a thing then on the gondola ride down we decided to just jam a little bit and it was just like I don't
01:00:08 know the the gondola sort of over came over a mountain and you saw the the city lights and were just like jamming like
01:00:14 playing some music I wouldn't describe that nice transformative I don't know why but that popped into my mind as a
01:00:20 moment of in a way that wasn't associated with people I love but more with like a thing I was doing something
01:00:26 that was just it was just happy and it was just like it a great moment I don't think I can give you anything deeper
01:00:32 than that though well as a musician myself I'd love to see as you mentioned before music enter back into your work
01:00:40 and back into your creative work I'd love to see that I'm certainly allowing you to enter back into mine and it's
01:00:46 it's a it's a beautiful thing for mathematician for scientists to allow music to enter their work I think only
01:00:54 good things can happen all right I'll try to promise you a music video by 2021 but by 20 by the end of 2020 I give
01:01:02 myself a longer window all right maybe we can like collaborate on a band type situation what instruments do you play
01:01:08 the main instrument I play is violin but I also love to devil around on like guitar and piano for me to eat our own
01:01:16 piano so in in a mathematicians limit Paul Lockhart writes the first thing to understand is that mathematics is an art
01:01:23 the difference between math and the other arts such as music and painting is that our culture does not recognize it
01:01:31 as such so I think I speak for millions of people myself included in saying thank you for revealing to us the art of
01:01:40 mathematics so thank you for everything you do and thanks for talking today well thanks for saying that and thanks for
