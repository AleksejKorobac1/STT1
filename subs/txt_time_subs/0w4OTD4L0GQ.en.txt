00:00:28 what are you doing right now if you're watching this video chances are you'll be sitting down
00:00:34 somewhere and when you're sat down you're stationary right wrong well
00:00:41 sort of wrong while you may be stationary on earth's surface right now earth itself is moving
00:00:47 hurtling through space at speeds of around 30 kilometers per second
00:00:59 similarly the sun is also moving at speeds of around 220 kilometers per second dragging our entire solar system with it
00:01:07 as it orbits the galactic tide of the milky way of course we don't feel either of these movements
00:01:14 gravity keeps us bolted down for the ride but elsewhere in space and given enough time everything moves and everything flows
00:01:26 nothing remains stationary in space but what is it that makes the galaxy move well that's going to be our topic today
00:01:35 and it makes for one of astronomy's most intriguing mysteries as you are watching this video
00:01:41 everything in our local universe for millions of light years including the milky way and the local
00:01:48 group is being dragged through space pulled through the void towards a gravitational focal point which we
00:01:53 cannot see and whatever it is it exerts an astonishing almost godlike influence on the vast
00:02:02 swathes of space around it the milky way is a vast ancient and structured collection
00:02:20 of hundreds of billions of stars known as a galaxy the universe is teeming with them many
00:02:27 larger and more densely packed with stars than our own and when this many stars come together
00:02:33 gravity allows them to work as a coherent structure with a much stronger gravitational influence
00:02:41 galaxies are so incredibly massive that they can attract one another from millions of light years across space
00:02:46 sometimes getting close enough to collide producing new larger galaxies however the space between galaxies is
00:02:55 significantly more voluminous than the galaxies themselves and there is another force at work space
00:03:01 itself is expanding including the space between galaxies which pushes them apart
00:03:07 faster than they can attract one another spreading the contents of the universe more sparsely
00:03:14 this is known as the hubble flow galaxies are for the most part receding away from all other galaxies
00:03:21 uniformly as the universe grows consequently most galaxies are not close enough to collide with their neighbours
00:03:29 only very small localized pockets of space like our local group will be dense enough to collapse into a
00:03:35 single structure however while they may not be destined to collide
00:03:41 dense concentrations of galaxies can still exert influences on one another bringing them close enough that the
00:03:47 combined gravitational potential of the galaxies attracts more remote galaxies creating denser concentrations and emptying out
00:03:53 the space in between in a self-sustaining process this forms the overarching structure
00:04:01 that stretches across our entire universe the cosmic web kind of like a sponge there are areas of matter which branch
00:04:09 in every direction and large empty swathes in between the cosmic web is composed of enormous
00:04:17 walls of interacting galaxies known as galaxy filaments and these can contain hundreds of thousands of galaxies
00:04:26 and span over billions of light years the galaxies within these filaments migrate through paths within the structure
00:04:33 and streams of interacting galaxies flow converge and diverge like great cosmic water flows over distances difficult to comprehend
00:04:42 the individual thread-like components of a galaxy filament are known as galaxy clusters and superclusters
00:04:49 smaller groupings of tens hundreds or perhaps thousands of galaxies which are more concentrated than the
00:04:55 overall density of the filament and thus have more substantial interactions with one another
00:05:01 in truth the lines between clusters superclusters and filaments are slightly fuzzy primarily because we didn't realize that
00:05:08 galaxy structures of filament size could exist when we coined the other terms we knew galaxies could
00:05:13 cluster up but we never thought that they would be able to interact over billions of light years
00:05:24 over the past 40 years we have managed to build up a comprehensive three-dimensional map
00:05:29 of intergalactic space and we now know a considerable amount about our large-scale surroundings
00:05:35 not bad for a tiny world existing in the blink of an eye on a galactic time scale we know that our local group which
00:05:43 contains us andromeda the triangulum galaxy and more than 100 other small satellite dwarf galaxies
00:05:49 is situated in a relatively outlying region to a cluster of more than 1 300 galaxies known as the virgo cluster
00:05:58 this cluster happens to be the gravitational core of a much larger colony containing over a hundred galaxy groups
00:06:04 like ours called the virgo supercluster one of more than an
00:06:10 estimated 10 million galaxy the virgo supercluster extends over an area of more than 110
00:06:21 million light years and it is thought to be over 7 thousand times as massive as the local group
00:06:28 enough to exert a considerable influence on its intergalactic neighborhood but the cluster network doesn't end here either
00:06:37 a groundbreaking study in 2014 published by scientists at the university of hawaii
00:06:43 revealed that the virgo supercluster is just one component of an even greater network of almost unknowable
00:06:50 intricacy and scale our home galactic supercluster laniakea the lanikia supercluster extends over
00:07:11 half a billion light years across space and is home to more than a hundred thousand galaxies it is so vast
00:07:20 that for a long time we didn't realize that its constituent superclusters were connected laniakia consists of four main galaxy superclusters
00:07:30 us and the rest of the virgo supercluster the hydra centaurus supercluster the parvo indus supercluster and the
00:07:38 southern supercluster and despite their enormous cosmic distances from each other
00:07:43 they interlink to create a plethora of because the lanikia supercluster is so large it is not dense enough to be
00:07:53 gravitationally bound and so as the universe expands instead of coming together and condensing further
00:08:00 it should instead get caught up in the hubble flow dispersing the supercluster but that's not what we are observing in practice
00:08:09 or at least not all of what we're observing in addition to the universe's expansion elongating the structure
00:08:17 the entirety of the supercluster appears to be being attracted to whatever is in this area the question is
00:08:26 what could possibly be there that is powerful enough to unite galactic superstructures of this size
00:08:33 flows of galaxies aren't uncommon within galaxy wolves but this is more than just the flow
00:08:40 there is a gravitational anomaly here with enormous power which is anchoring the entire cluster
00:08:46 together and making it move like a sinkhole to a half a billion light-year basin
00:08:52 this anomaly is what we mean when we say the great attractor is the somewhat ominous name given to the gravitational
00:09:07 focal point of the lanikia supercluster thought to lie somewhere around
00:09:14 250 million light years away from the milky way and it is attracting the contents of the
00:09:20 cluster towards it everything for hundreds of millions of light years is attracted to
00:09:26 and flowing towards this one region which means one of two things either there is an unusually high
00:09:32 concentration of mass there like an ultramassive or dense galaxy cluster or perhaps something stranger like a monstrous
00:09:41 intergalactic black hole or a mysterious dark force which is counteracting the universe's expansion
00:09:48 in reality it is likely to be the product of a dense galaxy supercluster so massive that it is
00:09:54 influencing the entirety of the virgo supercluster as well as the other clusters around it but whatever it is
00:10:02 there is one fundamental issue we can't see it in addition to the nature of the source
00:10:09 itself one of the main things that makes the greater tractor mystery so intriguing yet infuriating is its location
00:10:19 it lies in an area of the sky which is blocked out by the milky way's galactic plane from the point of view of the earth
00:10:27 because of where the solar system lies in relation to the milky way's galactic plane its bright illuminated core and dark
00:10:34 dusty clouds extinguish the light reaching the galaxy from behind blocking out approximately one-fifth of our field
00:10:44 this area is known as the zone of avoidance where the galaxy's features make it virtually impossible to see or detect
00:10:53 anything within or beyond it there's nothing different about the space behind the zone of avoidance
00:10:59 it is just our position relative to the galactic core this is the problem in fact in about 100 million years or so
00:11:07 the sun will have orbited the galaxy's central black hole taking us to the other side of the milky
00:11:12 way where the backdrop of the zone of avoidance will be revealed but that's going to take a very very
00:11:19 long time and so for all intents and purposes we are stuck on this side and it just so happens that the largest gravitational
00:11:27 anomaly in the local universe which is dragging us and everything around us towards it
00:11:32 happens to lie behind this obstructed region ironic right it certainly makes for a genuinely interesting and somewhat
00:11:41 unnerving mystery in astronomy which troubled scientists for around 40 years the first signs of the greater tractor
00:11:51 were detected in the 1970s when we realized that the milky way galaxy is moving through space
00:11:56 back then there was no way to see or detect anything behind the zone of avoidance they didn't have the sophisticated
00:12:04 technology that we have at our disposal today and so around 40 degrees of the sky remained unmapped and unknowable
00:12:13 however as scientists began producing the first detailed maps of the cosmic microwave background
00:12:19 that is the primordial microwave radiation left over from the big bang which permeates all of space
00:12:25 they discovered what is known as the cmb dipole a gradient in the temperature of the sky from one side to the other
00:12:34 scientists quickly realized that this disparity is the result of the milky way moving through space
00:12:40 and the motion in the direction of the red area compresses the oncoming waves of radiation
00:12:46 ever so slightly causing that direction to appear slightly warmer as we know galaxy's moving through space
00:12:53 is not that unusual as all galaxies are moving apart largely in accordance with the hubble flow
00:13:01 but things can affect this flow namely gravity and the gravity of objects around a galaxy the discrepancy between a galaxy's
00:13:09 actual movement through space due to gravity when compared with what one would expect in an expanding
00:13:15 universe is known as its peculiar velocity in layman's terms the speed at which a galaxy moves through
00:13:21 space because of something other than the universe's expansion when we tried to measure our peculiar
00:13:29 velocity by tracking the sun relative to the cmb we discovered that we are moving towards
00:13:34 the constellation of centaurus at a speed of about 600 kilometers per second and this isn't by chance either
00:13:43 something in that area is attracting us but wherever we were headed it was situated behind the zone of avoidance
00:13:49 and so the cause of this peculiar velocity remained a topic of fierce initial hypotheses were that they were
00:14:02 just simply more galaxies in the direction of the zone of avoidance which we just couldn't see
00:14:08 the milky way's outlying position to the much denser virgo cluster was also attributed as a possible cause
00:14:16 however while the virgo cluster could attract us with its gravity it is not nearly massive enough to
00:14:22 explain the speed at which we are moving something considerably more massive was to blame
00:14:29 and then the mystery got even bigger quite literally as redshift surveys began mapping the
00:14:35 universe in 3d during the 1980s we realized that not only are we moving towards this
00:14:42 gravitational anomaly in centaurus but so are the galaxies both above and below the zone of avoidance
00:14:49 the power of the source was much greater than once thought in 1986 it was estimated that the source
00:14:58 of this anomaly lies between 150 million and 220 million light years away and two years later an international
00:15:04 team of researchers led by donald lyndon bell proposed that the observed motions of 400 elliptical galaxies
00:15:13 were best fitted by a large bulk flow of galaxies towards a so-called great attractor lurking behind the zone of avoidance
00:15:22 and thus the term was coined while we didn't know what was causing the great attractor in order to explain
00:15:28 our peculiar velocity as well as the motions of so many galaxies around us
00:15:33 the source of the great attractor was predicted to be around 10 quintillion times the mass of the sun
00:15:41 that's 10 million billion suns equivalent to many thousands of massive galaxies and so naturally astronomers were keen
00:15:49 to establish exactly what was lurking in the dark back when it was first noted our search
00:15:57 for the greater tractor was severely hindered by the zone of avoidance but times have changed and technology
00:16:03 has vastly improved for one thing we're not simply limited to observing visible light anymore
00:16:10 while the milky way's plane might be opaque to light that we can see radio and infrared emissions from galaxy
00:16:17 superclusters outside of the milky way are capable of penetrating the galaxy's clouds even if only slightly this gives us some
00:16:25 idea of what could lie beyond the avoidance zone albeit a very limited picture instead the best means we have of seeing
00:16:33 behind the zone of avoidance is through x-rays x-rays are another kind of electromagnetic radiation
00:16:43 like visible light radio and infrared like the latter x-rays can also pass through the opaque galactic plane
00:16:51 and are emitted by galaxy superclusters in addition there are far fewer x-ray emitting sources in space than there are
00:16:58 sources of infrared and radio waves making supercluster x-ray emitters easier to identify
00:17:07 in 1996 using data from the rosat microwave mission a team of researchers led by south
00:17:13 african astrophysicist renee krohn cortez discovered evidence for a galaxy supercluster within the zone of
00:17:20 avoidance that had previously evaded detection now thought to be a key galactic concentration at the heart of the great attractor
00:17:29 while the cluster had been undetectable through visible light within an area spanning just two degrees of the
00:17:35 sky by plotting the x-ray sources identified by rosat onto the area a significant galaxy cluster is revealed
00:17:42 in the backdrop known as arbul 3627 also known as the norma cluster
00:17:51 the norma cluster lies around 220 million light years away from the earth and is thought to be very close to the
00:17:58 proposed heart of the greater tractor and it is thought to have a mass in the region of one quadrillion times that of
00:18:04 our sun and so we realized that the great attractor was probably a supercluster with
00:18:11 arbol 3627 near its core however even at the time the team knew that the norma cluster probably didn't
00:18:19 account for the full picture while it is massive it didn't seem massive enough to account for the
00:18:26 peculiar velocity of the milky way something else must be at work but unfortunately we were still limited in
00:18:32 what we could observe due to the obscured zone and so the mystery remained inconclusive
00:18:43 while many scientists agree that the great attractor is the result of a dense galaxy concentration
00:18:49 i should take this opportunity to mention that it is by no means the only theory there were those who refuted the idea of
00:18:58 a galaxy supercluster being responsible due to the incomparable scale of its influence when compared with other
00:19:04 cosmic structures in fact because the universe's expansion is thought to be powered and accelerated
00:19:12 by a phenomenon known as dark energy there are those who suggest that only something equally as
00:19:18 dark would be sufficient to overcome it dark in the sense that it is unknown and beyond our realm of understanding
00:19:26 this brings us onto a branch of alternate explanations for the great attractor the idea that instead of a galaxy
00:19:33 supercluster attracting us a mysterious undiscovered force is responsible for the bulk flows of
00:19:38 galaxies that we see in lanikia like enormous jet stream air currents in the vacuum of space
00:19:48 this idea is called dark flow and it is defined as a non-random component of the universe's expansion which
00:19:55 deviates from the hubble flow causing galaxies to stream towards a single point
00:20:00 like the greater tractor rather than receding away from one another as one might expect
00:20:06 if this is the case and there is something darker at play than we yet realize then perhaps we might be able to see
00:20:13 evidence of a gigantic flow mechanism by searching for something at the opposite end of the great
00:20:19 attractor a great repeller if you would while that might sound a bit outlandish
00:20:26 in 2017 we did see something just like this the dipole repeller just as all galaxies in the lanikia supercluster
00:20:36 are flowing towards the great attractor they all seem to be flowing away from an area on the opposite end of the supercluster
00:20:43 a region which appears to be pushing its galaxies outwards and setting them on their galactic paths towards the greater tractor
00:20:51 perhaps the greater tractor and the dipole repeller are part of some dark cosmic system
00:20:56 capable of overcoming the effects of the universe's expansion however while the dipole repeller may
00:21:03 seem anomalous and indicative of something more spooky dark flow certainly doesn't need to
00:21:10 exist to explain it in fact the dipole repeller probably isn't even an anomaly
00:21:16 but rather a natural byproduct of galaxy cluster formation as the compound process of galaxies
00:21:23 gathering and attracting more galaxies creates denser galaxy clusters this process in turn empties out the
00:21:29 space around the cluster creating voids between clumps of galaxies the more populous and massive the galaxy
00:21:37 cluster the more voids will form around it as areas are raided for their galaxies to feed the structure
00:21:45 and so while it may seem like galaxies are being pushed away from the dipole repeller in reality nothing is pushing them only
00:21:53 the pulling force of gravity and the dipole repeller is merely just an area which has had its galaxies
00:21:58 emptied out by massive influences which holds the appearance of so then if there is no dark force at
00:22:09 work to produce these flows then what is causing us to move so fast if not the clusters in the region of the
00:22:20 in the early 2000s a study called the clusters in the zone of avoidance project or caesar selected x-ray signatures
00:22:27 recorded by the rosat mission for follow-up and investigation with newer more effective x-ray technology
00:22:36 the aim of the project was to map this final portion of the sky in the zone of avoidance that remained
00:22:41 uncharted for so many years and also to focus in on what makes the region of the great attractor so
00:22:49 great in doing so they identified over 200 previously undiscovered galaxy clusters in galactic
00:22:56 no-man's land including in the proposed region of the great attractor
00:23:03 however these clusters were found to be significantly less massive than what was once predicted to account for our
00:23:08 peculiar velocity only a tenth of the proposed mass in fact in reality the great attractor is not
00:23:18 nearly as great as we once thought while it is the focal point of the lanikia supercluster which is dragging
00:23:23 us towards it it is not the only thing influencing us instead the caesar survey revealed a
00:23:32 substantial concentration of galaxies much further beyond the greater tractor the shapley supercluster is one of the
00:23:45 most studied of its kind with its 25 constituent galaxy clusters marked here in
00:23:55 blue it is situated around 650 million light years away from the milky way and while it was discovered in the 1930s
00:24:01 by harlow shapley it didn't become a topic of interest until the late 90s and the advent of
00:24:07 better technology but from 1997 until 2001 no less than 40 scientific papers were
00:24:15 published on the cluster and in 2005 caesar discovered a concentrated region of galaxies in the
00:24:23 vicinity of the shapley supercluster nicknamed the shapley attractor an even greater a more massive galactic
00:24:32 over density than the great attractor lying around half a billion light years away in total shapley is home to more than 8
00:24:42 and has a mass equivalent to about 10 four times greater than the mass observed in the region of the greater
00:24:51 tractor by the same project and so it is now believed that this supercluster is contributing the lion's
00:24:57 share of influence responsible for the milky way's peculiar velocity while everything in our supercluster is
00:25:05 flowing towards the greater tractor the greater tractor itself is being pulled towards the shapley supercluster
00:25:12 yes the reason that the milky way is being pulled so quickly towards centaurus is due to the fact
00:25:18 that it is not just the greater tractor attracting us in that direction our peculiar velocity
00:25:24 is likely the result of a compound effect with the greater tractor responsible for about 44
00:25:31 of the motion being closer to us and the remaining 56 percent of our velocity owes to the much more massive and remote
00:25:37 shapley supercluster which is dragging the greater tractor and thus the galaxies in our supercluster
00:25:45 along with it and so it was with this crucial piece of the puzzle that astronomers at hawaii university
00:25:51 were able to redefine the boundaries of our local supercluster using the great attractor and the
00:25:56 effects of the more remote shapley attractor to map our galactic colony and define but there was one more piece of the
00:26:10 mystery which we had yet to discover when the shapley attractor was identified astronomers speculated that
00:26:15 there may be another even more remote galaxy supercluster which is also contributing to our
00:26:23 perceived movement across space and only five years ago did renee cron cortez and her team
00:26:29 the same team that discovered the norma cluster some 20 years prior finally solved the mystery that they had
00:26:37 been studying for many decades in 2016 kron courtferg and her team announced the discovery of a new
00:26:44 supercluster in the zone of avoidance region even further beyond than the shapley supercluster using data from the anglo-australian
00:26:54 telescope and the southern african large telescope they identified a region of over-density consistent with a galactic supercluster
00:27:03 around 800 million light years away this galaxy cluster termed the velar supercluster is the final piece of the puzzle thought
00:27:11 to contribute at least 50 kilometers a second to our peculiar velocity with the influence of the norma cluster
00:27:20 the shapley attractor and a little help from the velar supercluster the observed effects of the great
00:27:26 attractor that were noticed all those years ago can finally be explained
00:27:55 so with all these things considered what will be the outcome for us will we be pulled into the center of the
00:28:01 greater tractor will the rest of the lenny kia supercluster will it destroy
00:28:08 our galaxy in the process well the answer is almost certainly no while we are being lugged in the
00:28:15 direction of these superclusters against the expansion of the universe the force that drives the hubble flow is accelerating
00:28:23 we will never reach the shapley supercluster or even the greater tractor for that matter
00:28:29 as before long dark energy will have inflated the universe so aggressively that the influences of the great and
00:28:35 shapley attractors will no longer be able to overcome it though we are moving towards centaurus
00:28:42 right now the only thing we are headed for is a collision with andromeda and anything else which remains in the
00:28:48 local group our only eventual destination is the void the great attractor like all galaxy
00:28:56 clusters and groups will be dispersed into its constituent galaxies each being cast into its own section of
00:29:03 space thanks to the force that drives the universe's inflation but hey right now the separation of
00:29:11 galaxies hasn't occurred yet and it's going to be a pretty long time before it does
00:29:16 and we are fortunate enough to exist at a time when we can observe brilliant cosmic structures like leniencia
00:29:24 without them vanishing over the cosmic horizon there's just something about galaxies flowing like great lakes across space
00:29:33 that seems tantalizing and beautiful and it is remarkable just how far gravity propagates and though the great
