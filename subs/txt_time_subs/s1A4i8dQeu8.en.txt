00:00:01 if you want develop a thick upper back at home you'd be wise to do inverted rows guys pull-ups are my favorite back
00:00:07 exercise of all time but I don't think that doing them exclusively is the way to go maximize programming is about
00:00:13 eliminating potential weak links we got to do it all in this case you can't neglect the horizontal movement pattern
00:00:18 if you want to movement where you're moving through space while providing additional benefits inverted rules are
00:00:25 where it's at so first things first the difficulty you probably don't need weights for this it's all about
00:00:31 adjusting your torso angle basically how elevated your feet are and where you're grabbing on to the barbell or rinks if
00:00:37 you elevate your feet it's gonna become a lot more challenging simple as that so most of you even on the standard version
00:00:44 will struggle to get 10 20 reps which makes it a perfect strengthen muscle builder and if you strategically employ
00:00:49 right after your pull-ups even better because now your reps gonna be that much lower so difficulty is not a problem you
00:00:55 probably don't have to put weight plates on your chest just saying you probably won't have to add bands either this is
00:01:00 really a tough exercise by itself especially if the range of motion is somewhat decent now the requirement is
00:01:06 not that your body touches the bar nor your hands reaching the gymnastic rings I just want you to contract that upper
00:01:12 back pull your squeeze as hard as you possibly can and you keep going man this will give you tremendous carryover to
00:01:17 not only pull-ups believe it or not because it is a bodyweight movement there is carryover to certain extent if
00:01:23 you're strong enough but also the front lever holding yourself in that position absolutely beautiful and it's just a
00:01:30 great exercise to do for your overall upper back stability especially if you're doing a lot of push-ups
00:01:34 especially if you're doing a lot of bench press weight etcetera this is the best way to complement in fact we're
00:01:40 talking about specificity this is literally it what better moment then lying down on your back pulling yourself
00:01:47 up basically the reversal even grabbing on to the exact position if you choose to do that that's what I'm talking about
00:01:52 feasible effective and simple setup for mostly washingtons video you can do this on top you pull the bar by suspending
00:01:59 towels or even the pillow sheets you can do this by grabbing onto a desk elevating your feet on some chairs there
00:02:05 are many creative options the best way is with gymnastic rinks or one of my secret techniques doing it upside down a
00:02:10 power rack and there's the ways to customize that too so there's lots of variations to choose from
00:02:15 you can do it quickly you can do with pause at the top rings barbell upside down desk you name it
00:02:22 inverted rows will take care of back thickness and I strongly recommend you do them and the best part in all this is
00:02:30 that recovery is not compromised there's no strain on the lower back which means you have a body weight exercise that
00:02:35 puts you in the right intensities perfect progression but no strain in the area which can potentially cause
00:02:42 injuries in the area that can affect you for your squat and deadlift performance this means you can do inverted rows on
00:02:48 Monday squats and deadlifts on Tuesday you'll be absolutely fine a per back might be sore obviously but lower is
00:02:54 gonna be no problem cuz you're not doing a heavy barbell row but you're getting the same training effect now that's not
00:02:59 stimulus to fatigue I don't know what is and for bigger guys especially you can use that recovery edge for guys we're
00:03:06 just lifting very heavy in general you can use that we do strain in the lower back that's one of the reasons why I
00:03:11 transition into doing a lot of band roles but I eventually realized that this gets the job done too and it's fast
00:03:17 I just do it upside down a power rack or using rings I'm just removing the bench doing it that way you know so it's fast
00:03:23 it gets the job done you guys are gonna love it start doing your rolls I don't care what type of athlete you are you
00:03:28 can never go wrong with this time proven exercise by the way this exercise would do wonders for yoke especially if you
00:03:34 combine it what handstand push-up some gymnastic rings man you're gonna have some crazy chat the Velma if you do this
00:03:39 combination so that said give me feedback down below let me know we have a lot of experience with this exercise
