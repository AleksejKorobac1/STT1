00:00:01 this is a video that people have asked me to watch is this it right here all final fantasy mounts and how to get
00:00:07 them is this it okay here we go hey buttons today i'm taking on the mountainous task
00:00:12 of showing you how to get every single mount in final fantasy 14. remember that to mount up at all you'll
00:00:17 need to have done the quest my little chocobo at level 20. and that's after you pick a grand
00:00:22 company if you see this symbol my little straightaway so you might be able to find it on the marketboard
00:00:27 if amount is an achievement reward you'll need to pick it up from jonathas near abkhalu falls in gardenia
00:00:33 i'll also talk about mounts that are no longer obtainable at the end of this video all right first stop gold saucer here
00:00:39 you'll play mini games to get a special currency called mgps you can trade for mounts and other loot
00:00:45 here are the various mounts and their costs okay wait holy that's cool that's a big boy
00:00:56 so you can get wait what the wait this is a mount how do you ride her oh never mind oh man i thought the girl was
00:01:03 the mount man that's some damn dude bro that's some that's
00:01:12 they had to play me like that okay what the oh that's cool that looks like the monsters in doom
00:01:39 what the those are actually bad ass what the hell is this it's cactus jack holy this is actually
00:01:46 wait and you're on his shoulder you can ride this around what the hell it's a cactar
00:01:57 next up pvp now as long as you are above level 30 you are good to pvp everybody's stats in hp are equalized
00:02:05 right so gear and levels beyond 30 don't matter pvp is a great way to get mounts such as the aerodynamics
00:02:12 system this comes from winning 100 fields of glory front line pvp matches to get the achievement in a blaze of
00:02:18 glory five next you can get the gloria class airship by winning 200 meters
00:02:25 that's not an airship that's an a that that's like an air like a little baby baby airplane
00:02:32 what is how is this it was just an airplane for ants look at it they're so small it's a hobby
00:02:39 yeah this is a little hoverboard what the hell is this of the feast the logistics system mount
00:02:45 is awarded when you win to okay thank i'm so happy to see this so it's not just blizzard that does recolors
00:02:53 this is literally a recolor of the blue one so it's it's not just it's not just blizzard everybody does it yes final fantasy does
00:03:03 it too you've got the the blue star and you've got the death star
00:03:08 good frontline matches with the same grand company magitek avenger is from winning rival
00:03:14 wings 100 times wow avenger a1 is obtained by winning hidden gorge 100 times
00:03:24 tech sky armor costs 20 000 wolf marks from the storm sergeant school's den provisioner at the wolves den
00:03:30 pier that is really you can get wolf marks just by participating in pvp the safeguard system is obtained by
00:03:37 winning 100 of frontline matches the serpent war steed is from winning 100 frontline matches with order of this win
00:03:43 that one sucks for the storm more steed you'll need to win 100 frontline matches with the maelstrom
00:03:48 for the flame more steed you'll need to win 100 frontline matches with the immortal flames
00:03:53 and for construct seven you'll need to win 100 onsol jacquere matches and i just want to add that in
00:03:58 the course of me making this video and getting all the footage that i needed of the different
00:04:02 pvp mounts all of the people that i met from the pvp wait it is like gmod
00:04:09 this actually is just like gmod what the i i think gmod looks way cooler than that
00:04:14 one okay i'm gonna be honest i think gmod looks way cooler however it's a hundred victories i'd have to
00:04:22 farm the out of that one you can get this mountain yeah extremely nice way out of their way to help me
00:04:29 find the mounts that i needed to record and they were just super cool overall they told me to send people over
00:04:35 to the pv paisa discord server which is like the balance but for pvp okay with a bit of guidance from them you
00:04:41 might rank top 100 and get yourself a menacious mount those mounts will be released to the top
00:04:45 100 players per data center after the current season ends and will not be obtainable after that
00:04:50 the mentor roulette is a special duty roulette that you'll unlock by being a pve mentor and completing
00:04:56 every dungeon trial guildhust and rey so they have the mentor system in final fantasy wait did wow take this from
00:05:01 final fantasy damn well they should have done it better because like the wow version
00:05:08 sucks piers in mentor roulette i'll put a complete list of the content you need to complete to unlock mentors
00:05:14 but if you do it 2 000 times then you will get the astro holy it's a unicorn
00:05:22 it's a unicorn dude what the hell that's crazy is it it's a it's a pegasus unicorn pegasus
00:05:29 it looks pretty great but i asked the person who was posing for this how long it took them to get the astro
00:05:33 and they said they did mentor roulette all day every day for a year
00:05:41 so you betta stroke in for a grind every tank can get a basic mount and an armored version of it
00:05:48 so for warriors i want to say right here if you look at tanking classes every time
00:05:54 these are for alpha males okay and so you look at the these are the alpha male classes tanks
00:05:59 are obviously the alpha male class these are the coolest mounts you have look at that tiger look at the
00:06:06 saber-tooth tiger he this guy he's on steroids like this the tiger works out
00:06:12 it's not just a guy the tiger does too look at that bear look at that what even is that
00:06:16 that's like a like a legendary pokemon at the bottom right
00:06:23 i think it can get a basic mountain and an armored version of it so warrior there's a war bear and battle bear
00:06:31 that's badass battle lion the dark knight the war panther and battle panther wait that was the one i
00:06:37 was going to play was dark knight wasn't it because it that's the one that has like the big sword
00:06:49 holy all mounts fly how the is this gonna fly please explain to me
00:06:56 how this flies because it couldn't even evolve enough to stay alive until whenever we're here
00:07:01 oh it's magic gun breaker the war tiger and battle tiger damn that's badass paladin and dark
00:07:07 knight's first mount the ones with achievements that say high level duties i'm gonna get that can be
00:07:12 farmed on anything level 50 plus that's extreme or savage i'm going to get that a solo garuda x
00:07:19 and sync would work i i will get that announced for that and both gun breaker kitties will require i think that the armored
00:07:27 version sucks i like the unarmored version the unarmored version is like the last phase in a boss fight
00:07:33 whenever he's like at full power and he's fighting for his life this for this is like the first part of
00:07:38 the boss fight where like he just easy mechanics that are you know not that hard to avoid
00:07:42 but like nah i i don't give a about that i want to get the the unarmored version i think it looks way
00:07:46 more badass fire at level 16 content or or lovely roulette that's so bad why did
00:07:54 those beauty roulettes have bonus active so if you want to grind for the armored tank mounts
00:08:01 or for the two sabretooth tigers farming stormblood trials unsynced would be a pretty effective way to do that
00:08:07 and to collect totems for dogs which i will get to in a minute there's the unicorn which comes from this one's for girls
00:08:14 this is not for me like can we please get back can we please get back to the
00:08:20 bears that are on steroids that have like five tails coming out of them and they're on fire like what is this i
00:08:28 i'm not i'm not the target audience for this okay level 30 conjurer class quest
00:08:35 unicorn power and the marble which is a reward for the true blue achievement this is a pretty tough one requiring
00:08:41 that you clear turn five of the binding coil of bahamut turn four of second coil of bahamut
00:08:48 turn for a final coil of bahamut burden of the father's side it's a piranha the sun savage and soul of the creek
00:08:56 look at the guy's face he's like yeah yeah bro it is what it is man yeah bro it is what it is this guy's
00:09:04 yeah he's cold chilling now i i think it's not a tentacle monster right it's not like that
00:09:09 if it was there'd be there's something holding the cat only party synced that's badass silence echo turned
00:09:16 off that's really cool that's a cool ass thing no joke you'll need a dedicated group for these
00:09:21 and so i'm going to leave some blue mage raiding discords in the description box below if you're
00:09:27 ready to take on what i've been referring to on stream is project hentai good luck and finally yeah we're gonna
00:09:33 do that that sounds like something that i'm interested in doing  yeah so we'll try that and we'll see
00:09:39 what it is project hentai yeah so  i do want to announce  that i will be playing this game  quite
00:09:48 quite soon  turns out there's some new information that's come to light that has made me  feel like it's a
00:09:53 little bit more  more pressing for me to more pressing for me to insert myself into this game
00:10:03 the jobs category if you get all battle jobs to level 80 you will get an omaro mount it's
00:10:09 basically level until you can say i'm a wrong stupid who the wants this piece of trash
00:10:15 look at this stupid mouth job's still level next up recruiter how much of an idiot
00:10:21 you have to be a ride that stupid dumb bird around a stupid ass
00:10:29 that's like a scuffed chompy dark knight's not available until heavensward listen bro like you gotta
00:10:34 understand something what do you think i do whenever i stop streaming oh wow you're gonna have to
00:10:39 put 50 hours into this great i can do that in two days that's nothing friend to join the game by sending them
00:10:46 your recruit a friend code they can only redeem it after buying the game
00:10:51 and within their first free 30 days of play time if they redeem your code and then
00:10:55 subscribe for 90 days yeah after their first 30 days you'll get a draft jacob
00:11:05 in the mail oh it's a two-seater okay  that's kind of cool i like that that's all right
00:11:11 do remember that that 90 days that they pay for does not include the first or free 30 days that
00:11:16 they got for buying the game if you recruit one friend you will get five gold chocobo feathers
00:11:23 if your friend subscribes for 150 days you will get five gold chocobo feathers and gold
00:11:27 chocobo feathers can be traded for mounts so there's the mana garm which costs eight feathers
00:11:33 what's this it looks like diablo with a small head hey guys i'm the lord of terror
00:11:43 it's it's like a small headed diablo what the brother this is a loser mount i don't
00:11:48 want to look at this guy anymore the guy looks like a dumbass looks like a let's look at the
00:11:54 next one you wash your hands nah bro why would i wash my hands dude i got a clean dick
00:12:00 i never wash my hands because i never get my hands dirty i never get my dick dirty either actually not ma
00:12:06 actually that doesn't no i don't mean no  all right let's watch the video man shut up shut the up you save
00:12:13 him because it's ugly i think he's ugly the two-seater amber drop
00:12:19 this is stupid cause eight gold feathers i thought amber meant yellow but it's red i don't know why and twin tonia
00:12:26 costs 15 gold feathers so good luck recording no why what the 15. holy that's so badass that's a lit
00:12:41 that's a little mouth the old featherstone the swirly thing around his neck is kind of stupid but like the
00:12:46 yeah that's a straight-up dragon main story quest will award you you know what makes me mad about wow
00:12:50 is like the fact that they only let you ride on drakes it's like they're like oh it's a bronze drake
00:12:57 oh it's the red drake it's the emerald drake i want a dragon i want a i want a full grown
00:13:05 big ass like where you're on it i want to be like this where's that where's like  i'm not
00:13:10 fine i can't find it man i can't find it so i want to be like this i want to be like this and i'm the whole
00:13:17 mount is i'm the whole mount and i'm riding and i'm the raccoon right
00:13:25 and and i'm the dragon too and i'm i'm falling off give me a minute but you see what i'm saying so like it's me
00:13:32 like and that's how big it is and like i'm on a i'm that dragon and i'm flying around with the raccoon
00:13:38 on my back that's actually me but i'm a dragon with several mounts just for playing through it
00:13:44 the first one you get is your first mountain the company chocobo this is how you do your own reborn story
00:13:49 quest pick a grand company and pay company seals for a checkerboard license you can decorate your company chocobo
00:13:55 with various fun chocobo bardings but there's wait so they could do wait so you were able to
00:14:00 do the same thing that i said that wow should do with mounts where you have like base mounts
00:14:05 and you can put special on the mount so this literally has the thing that i want wow to have
00:14:12 only chocobos that's fine can you give it a like a like a strap-on dick is there something like that you could
00:14:22 yes a lot of them and that's kind of beyond the scope of this video the magitek
00:14:31 armor comes from the realm reborn mate's request the ultimate weapon the black chocobo comes from the heavens
00:14:39 you just don't skip over that mainstream request does that do damage ultimate weapon that's really cool from the heavensward
00:14:45 main story quest divine interest mana cutter comes from the heavens
00:14:51 holy look at that word made for requests into the earth midgard stormer from the heavensward main story quest
00:14:59 fetters of lament what y'all from stormblood's main story quest in the footsteps of barbara yeah this one's dumb
00:15:05 so just another reason for you actually no it's not that's really cool to do the main story dungeon is one of
00:15:12 my favorite activities in the game and it's a great way to get some super rare amounts deep main story best fetters look at that
00:15:22 and that's a giant ass massage look at that what is this the yule from stormblood's
00:15:30 main story quest in the footsteps of bardum the brave yeah just another reason for y'all to do
00:15:38 to do it oh the y'alls deep dungeon is one of my favorite activities in the game and it's a great
00:15:43 way to get some super rare amounts if you're committed to it there are two types of deep dungeon in the game currently
00:15:51 palace of the dead which you can unlock from the level 17 side quest the house that death built in new
00:15:57 gradania you can obtain a disembodied head what the that's badass yeah it's like a dark souls mount or some
00:16:11 ten gal morin potts shirts you get one gal more and pot shirt for clearing floor 50 of palace of the dead and
00:16:17 the pot shirts have a random chance to drop from bronze coffers anywhere in pals of the dead
00:16:22 also in palace of the dead you can get a knight pegasus this one honestly looks like trash
00:16:29 like this actually looks like dog like i would i would turn in currency to not have this
00:16:37 i would turn it i would be like please do not do not put this upon me do not
00:16:45 inflict me with this illness do not hurt me with this thing you can sell it
00:16:56 this drops from gold trimmed sacks which come from floors 151 to 200 but you will need a dedicated
00:17:02 group of the same four people like a mini mini static of four people
00:17:09 to go with you from 151 to 200 it might take you a couple of days and you will probably need to read up
00:17:14 about the monsters in there because once you die it resets you it's like game over you
00:17:18 gotta start over that's not anyway have fun don't die also there's heaven on high
00:17:24 that's a deep dungeon added in storm blood you unlock with a level 61 quest knocking on heaven's door in the ruby
00:17:30 sea okay the dutto is heaven on high's version of night pegasus i suppose what the
00:17:46 what the is this dude look at that it drops from platinum haloed sacks to progress through on your save
00:18:12 each time you reach floor 100 you will get an empyrean relic damn we'll give it a 4 100 four
00:18:17 separate times and you can trade your four imperium reliquaries to the confederate npc for four empyrean accessories equip them
00:18:27 and talk to him again and he will give you the mount next up raid and dungeon drops now there's only
00:18:33 one mount that drops from a dungeon that is the magitek predator it has a chance to drop from zenos
00:18:39 in the alamigo dungeon now so this is literally a gmod this mount is literally a g mod
00:18:49 straight it is a straight up new g mod oh god oh you god dude all right
00:18:58 all right all right it's more like shred yeah whatever all the rest of the mounts that i'm
00:19:02 gonna mention in this section are raid mounts that have a 100 chance to drop they're all guaranteed to drop
00:19:08 and depending on when you're watching this video after it was released some of the raids may be easier than
00:19:13 they are now so wait a minute so like if y'all said about master lute
00:19:19 does it drop for one person or does it drop for everybody okay can you masturbute that to yourself
00:19:33 is that right huh let's see what we're going to be able to get i get a higher i can't even say it
00:19:46 i sure hope i get a high roll on the item any of these mounts unsynced recently leave a comment saying
00:19:53 how hard it was and how many people you needed or if you needed to know any mechanics just to help your fellow mount hunters
00:19:58 with the most that's cool alexander oh that was that one ball
00:20:17 that's cool oh look at that it's what the hell that's honestly bro this is some
00:20:26 scuffed ass comic that thomas the tank engine like what is this
00:20:34 what's this what arnold the the airplane the what does this guy even look like this is our it's like corky yeah what
00:20:43 the the darkmoon dariable bro this looks like what is that this looks like it's
00:20:51 straight this is like a bad guy in a pixar movie that's cool i like that okay
00:21:25 wait you can have other people in the mount so you can have other people in this mount that's a four-seater mount
00:21:37 that's bad that damn that's bad i like that's really cool beast thanks for a hundred dollars
00:21:49 thank you man rama so it's zeus but he's a centaur with wings wait a minute the player
00:22:13 isn't the nine-year-old anime girl is it oh my god that's me oh god okay
00:22:34 wow that is really cool though trial amounts and for trial amounts unlike the raid mounds they do not have a guaranteed
00:22:40 chance to drop they have a rare chance to drop from the boss itself i'm familiar with every time you
00:22:45 kill the boss you get a totem which you can eventually trade in to an item exchange npc
00:22:50 for the mounts you can trade in 99 totems or amount okay that's cool takes a couple of major
00:22:55 content patches after that trial boss was released before you can actually
00:23:02 buy the mount with totems so with all of that said here are the trial mounts and where they
00:23:06 drop okay let's see them that's stupid that's so dumb i don't even want to look at that that's the
00:23:11 dumbest mount i've ever seen my whole life that's the dumbest this is the second dumbest mound i've ever seen in my whole life
00:23:18 this is so stupid like these unicorns are dumb as hell what is this epona what what what's it
00:23:25 what's this e ponies going on oh it's vaporeon that's great that yeah these suck thank god they're
00:23:36 hard to get apparently  this is just they're all just recallers all right that's that's that that one's badass
00:23:56 that that that yeah okay that that's that's that that one's it yeah that one's what it's about man
00:24:02 that zapdos yeah what the hell this is cool with a stupid little red horn man okay the red one is cool
00:24:26 yeah i guess i'm about the red one damn actually that one looks really nice what
00:24:40 the hell yeah what do you guys think about that one i feel like the design on that looks
00:24:45 really good no it's not just because it's purple it's because it looks cool what do you mean
00:24:53 yeah it looks cool guys like stop it's but it does help that it's purple yeah it does help
00:25:17 yo dab him thanks for 100 appreciate it man thank you that's cool
00:25:29 wait this is like the heart of the aspects wait so this is like wait so you don't this is the heart of the aspects but you
00:25:38 don't buy it on the store so realistically realistically just be could i get this mount
00:25:56 yes e i could get it easy i could get it super easy so do they have mounts in final fantasy
00:26:01 that are like the mounts that like they look so badass and they're so
00:26:08 cool and they can you guys 20 people can ride on the mount and and it's like a really cool
00:26:15 and it's big and it's like super hard to get because like that's what i want to see i want to see like the the mega
00:26:20 dick mounts like this one is so badass though this is actually really cool
00:26:29 wow this is dumb this is dumb this is honestly this is so dumb this is
00:26:36 this is from deviantart i saw this yeah this is from db this is from deviantart cerberus no it's not servers got three
00:26:44 heads bro like what the do you mean spot
00:27:01 that one does look cool to be fair that one doesn't cool all right
00:27:36 damn yeah damn bruh that's like a  it reminds me of the demon of hatred in sakiro
00:27:46 that's so cool man small head though that's okay man that's totally okay that's so badass see
00:27:53 this mount i like a lot this is an actual cool mountain you need to get so i have to collect all
00:27:58 the all the other mounts in order to get this one so it's like the emerald drake
00:28:02 and you like awake the drake's achievement in wow it's the same thing bro that's so badass that's
00:28:17 i like it yeah that is cool too this is actually really cool  what really kills it for me is the face

00:28:51 he got like it's all the way up against the face like this that's the way it looks man it looks
00:29:07 innocent this one looks stupid oh that looks cool but look at his face man he's got no pixels on his face
00:29:16 that one's cool i like that one's way cooler that's actually badass with like the effect and everything but
00:29:22 like what's so weird to me is like look at that character man that's like the character at the
00:29:26 beginning of legend of zelda ocarina of time this is like the little girl that link talks to
00:29:33 and she's like oh sorry i've gotta my mom wants me to plant flowers wait what is this bro like it's it's
00:29:40 cute nah man it's weird like i don't want to see some
00:29:45 six-year-old anime girl riding on a dragon like the guy that needs to be riding on dragon needs to be like at least 250
00:29:54 solid muscle huge beard a giant like dragon slayer great sword just right now no no no gnomes
00:30:01 that's their stup gnomes are stupid man no i don't want gnomes in the game to get rid of them
00:30:12 now for the b-stride mounts as before i'll be separating the tribes by expansion and i'll show where you can
00:30:18 unlock those tribes and what reputation you need to get their mount
00:30:34 oh my god that's actually cool too i damn okay
00:31:19 this one looks kind of stupid i don't even know what this is what even is this
00:31:33 what the hell is this what the is this wait bro this is a dan that's literally a dandelion the only
00:31:45 good thing about this mount is you get to look up her skirt like that's the only good thing about
00:31:50 what oh you're going to literally you're going to fly around on a dandelion like that's it look at this look at this
00:31:57 it's not a mailman it glows yeah of course it glows it's a dandelion they glow on their own
00:32:05 yeah that's the only good thing about it yo it's soundless oh my god oh
00:32:45 oh whoa okay all right so the elephant is really cool but it's dumbo
00:32:56 yeah true see like this in my opinion i think this is stupid
00:33:03 but i don't like how the how the elephant can fly well i don't care if it's a magic
00:33:10 elephant this got helium in his in his horns and so he gets to fly i
00:33:16 it's magic i'm just i just i think it's like it is crazy man you can fly around on an elephant you fly around on an
00:33:27 elephant dude how are you gonna fly around on an elephant is too even dumbo doesn't dumbo have wings
00:33:39 dumbo has wings doesn't he he has ears so where's this is he are here his ears aren't even moving

00:34:29 i'm totally okay with this one because you can clearly see that it's using like its ears to fly
00:34:35 right like it makes sense this is a yeah this is an actual because it makes it this is cool
00:34:42 even though i'm not gonna be riding this right but like it's it's just it's a little bit much

00:35:06 what the next up hunts these are different world bosses that you'll need a big group to take down
00:35:11 to find such a group and to know when the bosses are up i recommend you join the centurio hunt discord server that's cool
00:35:17 i've got it set up to ping me anytime there's an s rank and that's pretty cool to unlock hunts for all expansions
00:35:22 you'll need to make sure you've done all the quests that i'm showing on screen now you can pause it if you need to and
00:35:28 really you shouldn't miss the opportunity to do the best named quest in the game what is it
00:35:35 the wyvern is sold for six clan mark logs you get the clan mark logs for 500 centurio seals each from artelane no
00:35:41 actually i don't know i kind of like him in a way because he's unique he's like he's like
00:35:47 he's like if wawa luigi was a mount in foundation you'd then trade the clan mark logs to bertana and idol
00:35:53 abstract the centurio tiger comes from killing 3 000 a ranks and 2 000 s ranks yeah that's
00:35:58 the thing you got game the triceratops is from killing two thousand a ranks and one thousand springs
00:36:08 zones nah man look at that bro what the killing two thousand a ranks and one thousand s ranks in norwant
00:36:16 bro what the how'd he do that how he do that magic nah bro well you can't use magic for everything
00:36:24 you can't use magic for anti-gravitational tech nah bro it's not how are we going to do that how malmos
00:36:31 fight what the how are you going to do with flying around what he does like at least give him like if
00:36:36 you're going to have some mount at least give him like a jet pack on like his tail or something
00:36:43 that's why it's just like it i don't know it's weird man and forgiven reticence is purchased from zile at the crystarium
00:36:51 or ilfroy at yulmore for 3200 sacks of nuts you can get your hands on some nut sacks by killing elite marks
00:36:59 sort of related to hunts wait should you say nuts nut sacks 200 sacks of nuts
00:37:16 that's good okay so this mount is it just it looks like it's missing a little bit too many pixels i'm gonna be honest
00:37:28 by killing elite marks sort of related to hunts are special fates that are big bosses that appear very rarely
00:37:36 you can also track these through the centurio hunt discord server ixian is a mound purchased with 12 ixan horns
00:37:44 the horns are obtained from the rare fate a horse outside in the logs that what is this dude this mount you

00:48:48 what do you how do you guys come up with this it says it's complicated bro yeah right yeah
00:48:55 right dude there is the magic bed crafted by a carpenter which requires three enchanted elm lumber
00:49:01 four undyed velveteen and four clouds breath and there is the high bodice which you get by scoring at least
00:49:09 10 000 points on an ocean fishing trip ocean fishing being a new feature that was added then there's sky builder

00:49:58 gorilla in order to get that mount that's the way it works you have to yeah you have to kill a gorilla
00:50:04 and the doll mill is a possible reward from the cupola fortune mini game in the firmament the hell
00:50:11 there's also the terran which requires you to earn 500 000 points
00:50:17 towards your skyward score as every disciple of the hand and land this is an absolutely monumental agreement and i
00:50:28 it's okay anyone that would have this mount that i could record for footage for this video wait a minute with the help of a
00:50:34 friend who speaks in japanese i hopped over to the only wait so is this mount like so why is this mount so
00:50:41 hard to get is it hard to get because it's like a special like ju it's like a jumping
00:50:47 puzzle thing it's a it's a massive grind oh oh it's a grind okay never may have to craft forever it
00:50:54 takes nine years to do yeah thank god it's not that cool person that i knew
00:50:59 had it in the entire world a person on a jp server and they put up with me allowing me
00:51:05 to get a bit of footage of the tyrannodon so i'm happy to show that footage to you now

00:51:33 introduced in stormblood i'm gonna direct you to a discord for this one as well which i will drop in
00:51:38 the description box below tyrannosaur drops in a nemo's via nemo's lock boxes
00:51:43 see this is the same thing that i was talking about with the with the drakes dude
00:51:49 it was the same thing because look you get to ride on these little you know but you never get to ride on a tyrannosaurus
00:52:02 like and and he doesn't fly like there's no way he gonna fly like i swear to god if he flies don't
00:52:07 you fly i nemo's fates don't you fly the eld thor
00:52:13 that's what i thought yeah yeah he can nah nah he can't how would he fly man look that was a that was actually a really
00:52:20 cool mount i like that this one is cool too i i really like this mount drops from gold bunny chests from bunny face he's just
00:52:28 like the other guy the other absolutely the eureka petrol drops from gold bunny chests
00:52:36 from bunny fates in high dados and demi osman okay drops from the final boss of baldessian arsenal in high dados
00:52:45 dude that's really good that is a 56 man raid it's gonna take wait did you say 56 man raid oh wait wait
00:52:53 one second in high dottos and that is a 56 man raid it's gonna take a bit of organization
00:52:59 and work with other players to get next up airship expedition dude that's badass it's easy i bet it
00:53:04 probably that's cool why 56 because 56 divided which is a prime number additions
00:53:18 there's only one mount for this because kind of a miscellaneous category you get a zoo for one iron voyage spoil
00:53:25 at all this is like the other taker in any housing district you get the iron voyage spoil by sending
00:53:30 your free company's airship on an expedition to sector 24. next player commendations you get 500
00:53:37 commendations from other players you'll get a gilded magic and the parade chocobo is rewarded for getting 3 000 player accommodations
00:53:47 oh wait that wait the chocobo is actually no way so they they really just went all the
00:53:53 way with this they said he doesn't even fly for lettuce but you get a cake out and this is going to go all the
00:53:58 way to the moon he's a chunker yeah this is great for getting 3 000 player accommodations
00:54:08 achievement points is another way to get mounts you'll need to talk to jonathas in gradient near abkhalu falls to
00:54:15 exchange your points for achievement certificates which you can then exchange for mounds this is also the npc you'll
00:54:20 need to talk to to get mounts that you've earned from different achievements here are all the mounts you can buy with
00:54:28 achievement certificates what is this what is it a claw machine you know if they wanted to make it
00:54:37 realistic they'd have it drop you halfway whenever you're up in the air because that's what happens like and you
00:54:44 know what i mean like you ever had those claw machines back whenever you were a kid and you'd
00:54:49 get like the good toy and like somebody else would do it
00:54:53 and it would like go and it would like grab it and it would be like this you'd see some other kid they'd be like
00:54:58 it like grabs it's like yep all right there it is and you get it and then somehow whenever you go to get yours
00:55:10 just all right let me try and try to get one come on all right one more okay that's another quarter all right
00:55:24 you know what i've had that happen to me like 50 times at gotti town man cotty town buffet pizza
00:55:34 they stole my goddamn money they stole my they stole my dad's money to be fair
00:55:40 my mom's money but did you get it in the end no i didn't get it in the end hell no i want to go play jurassic park
00:55:46 i'm not going to waste my money on that ready thanks for a hundred dollars guys is god g-a-t it's like nah got it
00:55:56 gaddy time that's  nah man how's he gonna do that no bro how's he gonna how's he gonna do
00:56:16 how's it gonna do that nah yeah right dude how's it gonna do there's no way
00:56:24 there's no way he's jacked this actually does look pretty cool like i i like this mount
00:56:37 okay this one is like i actually like this one i think this is cool it's like those mobs in anor londo
00:56:43 and dark souls one to grab your ass except without the eye obviously i wanted to show you all of
00:56:49 the unobtainable mounts that are no longer available in the game okay but are still pretty nice to look
00:56:59 there's no way dude imagine them adding fat black chocobo in america like there's no chance
00:57:09 that they would add that like literally no chance wait it's a bbc
00:57:22 i actually never mind i could see blizzard adding in a bbc yeah i could see them doing that well i
00:57:28 could see old boys are doing that nowadays probably not going to happen but yeah this is ridiculous oh
00:57:41 my god jesus original fat chocobo oh my god with the cake dude just
00:57:55 they dangle it right over his face to where like probably just a few little crumbs like
00:58:01 hit his beak and they fall off that's actually badass stupid that one's yeah that is really cool what the hell
00:58:30 okay garrow mounts i like the colors on that the wings the wings that's really cool
00:58:41 damn and this has got the yeah it's got the wings too the gold one looks way better
00:58:53 that's really cool that this actually is really really cool like it what's what's crazy for me to
00:58:59 see about this is like i would like to see blizzard look at these mounts and stuff like this
00:59:05 like obviously so like final fantasy is like so like blizzard doesn't take enough chances final fantasy i think in some cases
00:59:15 takes too many it's like what if we had a unicorn okay what if we had a unicorn with lightning
00:59:20 on it okay what if we had a unicorn with lightning on it that has
00:59:25  like little clouds as his feet what if we had a unicorn with lightning with clouds on his feet
00:59:29 that also had little strings of lightning coming off of him okay that's good what if we had a unicorn with a horn on
00:59:34 its head that had another horn on top of the horn that it already had on its head it's like okay and with the lightning
00:59:39 and the clouds yeah yeah that too okay what if we had all that and then on top of that he has two more
00:59:44 wings it's like okay all right how about that that's cool okay now what if you give him two more horns but now he's not a
00:59:49 unicorn it we call him a a triple corn it's a it's a tricorn and it's a three-horned unicorn
00:59:55 and like that's what they would do and so they just take it so far right and i wish that blizzard a triple
01:00:02 yeah whatever the you want to call it right it's a tricorn yeah what i'm saying is like the whole idea
01:00:09 is like it's just it's like escalation you know escalation escalation escalation and i wish blizzard would like try and
01:00:16 like take a little bit more chances with their mounts you know it's like the long boy you know
01:00:20 like the long boy was out of nowhere like you'd never expect blizzard to make something like that like a wait
01:00:25 was a brontosaurus like what the hell but like the long boy was one of the coolest mounts because
01:00:30 like they take chances they do crazy whisper go thank god that one's not in the game
01:00:45 that's so dumb that's the dumbest mount i've ever seen my whole life this actually the dumbest one do you
01:00:51 know what this looks like this looks like a knockoff version of a mcdonald's happy meal toy
01:01:03 this is scuffed this is this is the luigi's mansion knockoff that didn't even make it to america
01:01:22 okay oh now it's got a little thing on its head cool very cute
01:01:35 that that animation is cool okay you got ourselves another chonker oh okay so that's like a that's like an
01:02:04 wow wow that's cool so wait is this like a is this like a
01:02:17 so yeah is this like a gladiator mount basically like yeah it is i guess so give me one sec i took a piss
01:02:25 i'm back sorry about that somebody somebody dropped 250 for them for the kids somebody just dropped 250 for the kids
01:02:35 oh my god thank you so much man like i want to say right now by i'm not trying to set any
01:02:40 expectations but we are actually farther ahead than where we were at last time for our last goal
01:02:48 but we are already farther ahead guys we are popping off we are absolutely completely popping off
01:02:53 keep that in mind we gotta do a giveaway for y'all yeah we gotta do a giveaway if y'all
01:03:08 this one looks really cool so these are all  i guess these are like pvp seasonal mounts
01:03:30 yeah yeah yeah what the hell man that's badass and it makes sense
01:03:45 see this one makes sense because it's got like a bunch of robot on the bottom so it's like oh it's not magic it's
01:03:52 robot it makes sense what the that is really cool that's actually badass
01:04:25 you know what this reminds me of is back in the day i saw a picture of some guy who had a um
01:04:32 so he had a cpu tower right so it's the same as like a computer but it wasn't an actual computer and
01:04:38 what he had for a case was a taxidermied beaver and he could push the thing and then
01:04:45 part of the beaver would come out and there was a cd-rom it was a taxidermy beaver
01:04:51 and this is exactly what i'm thinking about whenever i see that what the is where's
01:04:56 that was funny dude that it was funny like  literally 20 years ago it's a
01:05:00 long time ago it was a real real long time ago that's so cool yeah it was funny as hell
01:05:08 this is the first thing reminds me of that one's really cool too yeah i like this damn that actually is nice
