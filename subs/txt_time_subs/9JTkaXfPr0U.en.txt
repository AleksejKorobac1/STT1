00:00:07 beyond the warmth of the Sun past the four rocky planets further than the gas giants at the very distant edge of our
00:00:15 solar system like two worlds that we are only just beginning to explore and understand they are the ice giants
00:00:23 Uranus and Neptune these planets are dozens of times the mass of the earth and are so distant that we've only
00:00:30 managed to visit them once in 1977 the Voyager 2 spacecraft took to the skies embarking on a 12-year mission to reach
00:00:37 what was once considered unreachable but as we learned more about these massive icy worlds we learned more about the
00:00:44 satellites that orbit them to the iciest the most far-out moons in the solar system and in the Neptunian system one
00:00:52 moon stands out from the rest triton Triton is a special moon with properties we never imagined objects so far from
00:00:59 the Sun possessing but it wasn't until we reached the moon in 1989 that we finally began to understand its true
00:01:06 origins Triton is a captured world plucked from its original position by Neptune and today we will relive that
00:01:12 story and how Triton came to be the Tritan was discovered just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself on the
00:01:30 10th of October 1846 by astronomer William LaSalle on his own self constructed telescope as a result it was
00:01:36 originally named the satellite of Neptune which had remained for over a hundred years it wasn't until 1949 that a second
00:01:42 moon was discovered around the mysterious planet and so the first had to be renamed where as planets are
00:01:49 typically named after Roman deities their lunar counterparts are often named after their Greek equivalents Neptune is
00:01:55 the Roman interpretation of the Greek god Poseidon as so Neptune satellite was named after the son of Poseidon giving
00:02:01 it the name we know by today Triton our first glance it would seem as if Triton is a child of the ice giant
00:02:09 Neptune at 2,700 kilometers in diameter is the largest of Neptune's 14 known moons and it's mass accounts for over
00:02:16 99% of the mass of all the satellites that orbit the planet this size makes it the seventh largest moon in the solar
00:02:23 system and 20% larger than the dwarf planet Pluto is made of mostly ice and metal with a rocky metallic core
00:02:30 encapsulated by layers of water ice as some have speculated that subsurface oceans may exist beneath its frozen
00:02:37 surface the moon is estimated to be composed of between 1/6 and 1/3 water ice but on the surface another frozen
00:02:45 material exists nitrogen this far away from the warmth and light of the Sun even nitrogen gas turns into a solid as
00:02:52 such Triton is covered in a sheet of frosty frozen nitrogen with cracks and icy lava flows ingrained on his surface
00:03:00 this nitrogen layer reflects over 70% of the precious little light that reaches the moon but even so the faint light of
00:03:06 the Sun still makes its mark on the surface the nitrogen covering exists in a very fragile equilibrium frozen by
00:03:13 Triton's average surface temperature of minus 235 degree Celsius however only a difference of a few
00:03:20 degrees and this equilibrium is broken and it gives the planet a feature we never thought we would find on the
00:03:32 Tritan is covered in geysers erupting material over eight kilometers into the air which is carried and deposited
00:03:38 hundreds of kilometers away by light winds this process is driven by the faint sunlight when it reaches the
00:03:44 surface of the thin sheets of nitrogen ice it heats the top layer an increase in temperature of less than five degrees
00:03:50 Celsius is enough to stir the material below turning the frozen nitrogen back into gas which bursts up through the
00:03:56 frozen surface with water ice and dark material these deposits mean that Triton's surface is constantly changing
00:04:02 and being reshaped but it also gives the moon an atmosphere Triton's atmosphere consists of mostly nitrogen from the
00:04:08 geysers and the geological activity with traces of methane also it is a very thin atmosphere but it is still enough for
00:04:15 clouds to exist within and wind currents to transport these dark materials downwind from the geysers geyser
00:04:25 activity does not explain all of the surface features we see the process is too light to explain the craters we see
00:04:31 distributed sparsely across its surface and so to find the origin of these features you have to look at Triton's
00:04:39 unusual orbit like most moons Triton is locked into a synchronous rotation with Neptune it orbits as fast as it rotates
00:04:45 meaning one side permanently faces the planet while the other side faces out into space however unlike most moons it
00:04:52 is the only large moon in the solar system which orbits in the opposite direction to its parent planet in what
00:04:58 is known as a retrograde orbit this unusual direction and the inclination of it provides insight into titans origins
00:05:05 if Triton was truly a moon of Neptune and formed at the same time and from the same collapsing cloud of gas then you
00:05:10 would expect to see the planet and its moons orbiting in the same direction we see this among all other large moons and
00:05:17 we also see seven so-called normal moons of Neptune orbiting in the same direction of the planet along its
00:05:22 orbital disk Triton on the other hand orbits much further away than these inner satellites and does so an unusual
00:05:29 angle and not along the orbital disk and what this indicates is that Triton is not truly a moon of Neptune scientists
00:05:37 now believe that Triton may actually be an object which formed beyond the orbit of Neptune
00:05:42 in the Kuiper belt a massive orbital ring of icy material and the very edge of our solar system leftover from its
00:05:49 formation it extends from Neptune's orbit to over 50 astronomical units away from the Sun so that's 50 times the
00:05:55 distance Earth orbits the star and there's more evidence for this theory as further out from Neptune across the
00:06:01 boundary of the Kuiper belt the moon has an estranged twin Pluto Pluto is the most famous Kuiper belt object due to
00:06:09 its famous reclassification to the status of dwarf planet but Pluto is not alone the Kuiper belt contains trillions
00:06:16 of lumps of ice ammonia and rock which are forming and destroying tiny dwarf planets and minor planets all the time
00:06:22 we now believe that this is how Triton formed - as mentioned is only 1/5 larger than Pluto and their compositions are
00:06:30 extremely similar so you would assume that if anything is made of the same stuff as Pluto it may have formed under
00:06:36 the same conditions but then if Triton was born in the Kuiper belt how did it come to be a moon of Neptune the theory
00:06:44 now states that Triton formed on the inner edge of the Kuiper belt but would have comes within touching distance of
00:06:49 Neptune's orbit as it traveled through the outer reaches of the solar system usually when this happens these minor
00:06:55 planets are moving too fast to be captured by a larger planets gravity so when the fledgling planet approached the
00:07:01 orbit of the ice giant something must have slowed it down we don't know for sure what might have caused trying to
00:07:06 lose its momentum but scientists believe the most likely cause would have been that Triton collided with a moon or
00:07:11 proto moon of Neptune or with another dwarf planet on top of this Triton may have formed as a dwarf planet with its
00:07:17 own small satellite moon which would have been displaced by Neptune's gravity further reducing its speed as a cross
00:07:25 paths with the giant planet regardless of how the impact would have halted Triton in its tracks rendering it
00:07:30 powerless as it was sucked into Neptune's orbit but it wouldn't have entered orbit around Neptune in the
00:07:35 circular fashion the Voyager spacecraft observed instead it would have been flung into the Neptunian system in a
00:07:42 chaotic highly eccentric and elliptical orbit which had a profound effect on the displaced dwarf planet when a moon
00:07:48 orbits a larger planet in an elliptical fashion the gravitational influence from the parent planet is constantly
00:07:54 changing as the distance between the planet and the satellite varies and this creates friction on the interior the
00:08:00 gravity of the planet squashes and bends the moon heating the interior through the appropriately named process of tidal
00:08:07 heating this process of friction heat and convection appears to have given Triton a very unique characteristic for
00:08:14 a moon geological activity it is one of only three geologically active moons in the solar system another being IO of
00:08:20 Jupiter which is active through the same tidal processes the gravitational forces of the parent planets can wreak havoc
00:08:26 within a planet's interior and it is a rare sight for a rocky satellite orbiting a planet while io is
00:08:32 considerably more active than Triton the tidal heating effect would have warmed the inner materials in the new surrogate
00:08:38 moon of Neptune causing them to burst through faults in the moon's surface giving it the rocky terrain we see today
00:08:43 which is tended to and reshaped constantly by the active geysers while this tidal heating effect is no longer a
00:08:50 consistent force on the moon Triton could be considered a hive of geological activity despite being billions of
00:08:56 kilometers from the Sun which disproved that once held belief that only silent icy worlds can exist this far away from
00:09:02 the Sun if Triton was captured by Neptune it would also explain the lack of the expected number of other moons
00:09:08 and might explain why not change second moon near yet has such a disturbed orbit around his parent planet
00:09:14 computer simulations have suggested that Triton's initial collision with whatever pulled it from the Kuiper belt caused
00:09:19 follow-on collisions between other moons and so while those moons lost Triton one it had begun life as an orphan destined
00:09:27 to aimlessly wander the vast outer edge of the solar system before being plucked from the darkness by Neptune we're at
00:09:34 now orbits as an adopted child of the massive planet so today we see Triton as a child of Neptune albeit a standout one
00:09:42 but had its fortunes been different it would have remained a dwarf planet orbiting within the Kuiper belt like
00:09:48 Pluto Sedna Eris and many other small suspended objects in this massive icy wall which separates our region of space
00:10:02 Troughton is a distant moon hiding some very unique properties humanity has a consistent present around some of the
00:10:08 nearby planets in our solar system but this secluded corner is still shrouded in mystery and so as humans it is our
00:10:16 nature and some might say our duty to explore beyond and we are planning to go back Voyager 2 is as of the making of
00:10:22 this video the only craft who have flown by the moon and neptune and it made use of a very rare occurrence in planetary
00:10:28 alignment in order to create a pathway to its destination our technology has since of are seeing
00:10:33 proved but reaching a world over 4 billion kilometres away is still an exceedingly difficult task of all the
00:10:40 proposed missions to Triton one that might deliver the best scientific value would be a landing mission when we sent
00:10:46 the Huygens probe to Saturn it landed on its moon of Titan and the photographs taken from the surface are the most
00:10:52 distant photographs from the body of another world ever taken over a decade on and we may be able to go one better
00:10:58 and land on the surface of a moon unfathomably further beyond even the gas giant planets however most of these
00:11:05 proposed landing missions have been snubbed in favour of missions to Jupiter and Saturn to further investigate the
00:11:10 life-supporting properties of there are many moons no Triton mission has yet passed the proposal phase but there have
00:11:17 been some theoretical missions to get us excited one such proposed mission is the aptly named Triton hopper a small craft which
00:11:24 would jump and land on the surface of the moon and harvest its nitrogen ice to use it as a propellant for a small
00:11:30 rocket to achieve small jumps or hops over the surface and while not a surface landing mission in March of this year a
00:11:37 new flyby mission to the moon was proposed to be the subject of NASA's next discovery mission called trident
00:11:43 this flyby would aim to establish whether Triton has a subsurface ocean as some have speculated and if such an
00:11:50 ocean was discovered we could begin to have serious conversations about the prospect of habitability on the moon we
00:11:55 know that Triton likely has organic compounds on his surface and so it is insane to think that even this far away
00:12:01 from the life-giving warmth of the Sun the building blocks for some kind of simple life may
00:12:06 list below the surface of this geologically active wonder despite this conversations of habitability seem to be
00:12:13 a bit premature seeing as we barely have our methods of how to reach the moon established but the more we analyze
00:12:18 moons the more we are learning that they have their own possibilities and features which may make them habitable
00:12:24 several moons of the solar system have their own possibilities for an awakening of life and in the case of Triton
00:12:31 certainly more so than his parent planet Triton is a tiny captured world orbiting a planet of mystery whose story is just
00:12:38 beginning to become clear to us with missions to Mars and Venus and the majesty of the gas giants is easy to
00:12:44 lose sight of just how fascinating this region of the solar system is and who knows what other fascinating discoveries
