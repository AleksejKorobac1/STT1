00:00:03 rome at its peak in the second century a.d the empire dominated
00:00:11 five million square kilometers from the atlantic coast to iberia all the way to the persian gulf
00:00:20 and at its heart was the eternal city cramped bustling filled with the colors sounds smells and fluids of a thousand cultures
00:00:30 poured into one marketplaces saw fine silks from the far east traded alongside artisan chainmail from gaul
00:00:38 and jars full of blood red wine from the roman heartland free men scholars and slaves of every
00:00:44 creed in colour rubbed shoulders in the streets the hub of a giant multicultural empire the perfect place for disease to proliferate
00:00:58 the ultimate super spreader city so it was in the summer of 166 a.d that famed roman physician galen found
00:01:10 himself battling an enemy much deadlier than any barbarian horde limping home from distant parthia in the east
00:01:18 three legions had returned with a cruel gift from those far-off lands their skin covered with sores and pustules
00:01:26 they burned with fever and the entire camp stank of loosened bowels death hung in the air
00:01:36 the plague quickly spread it struck indiscriminately affecting rome's citizens equally with cruel indifference to position or stature
00:01:43 galen tried to treat the afflicted some recovered their skin permanently scarred and their bodies
00:01:48 broken many weren't so lucky he studied the dead and dying he probed their wounds searching for
00:01:56 some common factor some hidden cause but even he the most accomplished physician in the city
00:02:03 failed to find the agent of such destruction the plague continued for years and from the empire's glorious center
00:02:13 outward it spread entire cities and towns wilting under its attack three years after its arrival in rome
00:02:20 the emperor lucius ferris finally succumbed and some 11 years later his co-ruler marcus aurelius also died with the very same
00:02:30 fever and blistered skin galen witnessed it all but was helpless to stop its seemingly
00:02:33 limitless spread by 180 a.d 70 million souls had died totaling more than a quarter of the
00:02:41 roman empire's entire population galen was a visionary of his age but he was trapped in the second century
00:02:53 and could do little more than document the pandemic as it unfolded had he possessed the scientific
00:02:59 understanding and equipment of a 20th century doctor he could have identified the sickness as smallpox
00:03:06 this vicious disease was only conquered in 1980 some eighteen hundred years after the devastating
00:03:12 antanine plague it was caused by a virus a mere particle less than one hundredth
00:03:20 of the width of a human hair this of course was not the first time viruses had changed the course of history
00:03:27 and it wouldn't be the last had galen possessed the understanding of our 21st century scientists he could have peered
00:03:34 into the genes of his fellow citizens to see the legacy of viruses written into our very dna
00:03:41 for what galen did not know what he could not have known was that his parthian gift had been evolving
00:03:49 hand in hand with the life it ravaged for billions of years potentially since before the
00:03:55 very beginning to understand the origins of the enigmatic viruses galen battled 1800
00:04:42 years ago we must first unravel what exactly his silent enemy was
00:04:49 and the first to even get close to this mystery was the russian botanist dmitry ivanovsky at the time
00:04:56 a plant disease was threatening one of the most valuable luxury exports of north and south america
00:05:02 tobacco plants in an effort to find the cause dimitri had taken the leaves of diseased plants and crushed them
00:05:09 reducing them to a liquid extract he then passed this extract through a solid porcelain filter
00:05:14 with pores so small that even the smallest known bacterium couldn't squeeze through
00:05:19 but to ivanovsky's surprise this processed filtered extract still had undiminished potential to
00:05:25 infect new tobacco plants whatever was causing the tobacco mosaic disease it was smaller
00:05:32 than bacteria what on earth could be so small he thought and still contain the essence of such coordinated
00:05:36 destruction it would take another 40 years of scientific advancement
00:05:49 before the virus was actually seen for the very first time if we could shrink our bodies down a
00:05:56 million fold so that we were just a micrometer tall we would be able to see with our naked
00:06:00 eyes the tiny viral particles responsible for such terrible diseases
00:06:07 as smallpox hepatitis and aids there are about 100 million more viruses on earth than there are stars
00:06:14 in the universe each less than a thousandth of a millimeter in size they are denizens of a rich and varied
00:06:20 nano cosmos each miniscule particle is intricately crafted as distinct in form and function
00:06:28 as the macro size life forms they infect in shape alone there are tiny rods smoothed and spiked spheres
00:06:34 angular dodecahedra and upright spidered forms that bear more resemblance to interplanetary probes than any life form
00:06:41 we know they range in size from a mere 20 nanometers to relative giants as large as a bacterium
00:06:48 giant pythoviruses cruise this nanocosmos leviathans searching for amoeba to infect ebola
00:06:56 is a grotesque knotted snake locked in a permanent rectus of torture while tiny bacteriophages seem the most
00:07:01 complex of all with features that resemble legs a head and a deadly
00:07:08 injecting syringe within these alien structures are genetic molecules
00:07:12 similar in construction to our own double-stranded dna or single-stranded rna but shorter simpler more naked and exposed
00:07:21 these are unlike the cells that make up the bodies of every living thing on earth they are little more than a hard protein
00:07:27 shell around a fragment of dna and each one is unique containing its own assortment of genes that tailor it
00:07:33 to a particular host a virus floating freely through the air is inert
00:07:46 and the virus unsuited to our body's chemistry is harmless only when a viral particle encounters
00:07:53 its preferred host will it spring into action with compatible chemistry it will be able to insert its genetic molecule fragment
00:08:00 into an unwitting cell to hijack its living processes to reproduce itself some simply use the
00:08:06 protein machinery suspended in the cell's cytoplasm to blindly reprint the viruses genes for packaging and shipment
00:08:12 back out of the cell but others are more tenacious these so-called retroviruses insert
00:08:19 their dna fragment directly into the dna of their host in reality the viral nanocosmos is made
00:08:25 visible only with the most cutting-edge technology and modern scientists are still working to understand how these seemingly simple
00:08:31 agents can bring about such suffering and how they can be conquered so we have seen the enemy the first step
00:08:41 to understanding its origins but even now a fundamental question remains unanswered what is a virus
00:08:54 and are they even alive answering this question cools into doubt our understanding of what separates life
00:09:01 from non-life on earth and elsewhere in the cosmos classic definitions are taught in
00:09:05 schools that living things all have the independent ability to move grow reproduce sense their surroundings
00:09:11 seek nutrients extract energy from them and excrete waste by this scheme
00:09:18 viruses are certainly not alive they do not grow they don't have any metabolic processes
00:09:22 and they are utterly reliant on a host for reproduction they are parasites as lifeless as dust
00:09:30 without the spark of life stolen from other living things there are of course exceptions though
00:09:37 as always in england in 1992 a new kind of microbe was found in a cooling tower
00:09:47 for ten years scientists thought it was a kind of bacteria because of its large size but high resolution imaging revealed
00:09:54 that it was in fact a virus of unprecedented size and complexity a leviathan floating amongst minnows
00:10:02 nearly 10 times as large as its cousins they named it mimivirus because it
00:10:11 mimicked living bacteria so closely these mimiviruses contained more than just a dna fragment
00:10:16 they also had enzymes and other machinery inside their shells not quite enough independent living but
00:10:23 much more than we had previously thought inert viruses capable of processing although the vast majority of viruses
00:10:30 may not be classically alive they are still undoubtedly of life the fact that they have the same
00:10:34 genetic molecule and the same biochemistry that makes them seamlessly compatible with living cells
00:10:41 must elevate them above the inanimate world even if they don't fully deserve a place in the animated one some scientists have
00:10:48 suggested that we revise our classification of life purely to include these potent organic nanoparticles
00:10:54 perhaps they deserve their own branch on the tree of life rooted at the base next to the origin of the domains of
00:11:01 bacteria and eukaryotes but one thing is clear to understand the viruses place among life on earth
00:11:09 we need to try and trace their history through geological time to know what they are we have to understand
00:11:18 how and when they began but finding the unimaginably small among the unimaginably ancient
00:11:25 is a problem modern scientists are only just beginning to tackle and the solution may not lie in the
00:11:33 rocks beneath our feet but within our very dna at the southeastern tip of england the
00:11:46 green fields of kent meet the blue of the english channel in the white cliffs of dover tower over the
00:11:58 modern day port they are a welcome sight to british travelers returning from the south
00:12:03 and were immortalized in wartime song as a beacon of hope for better things to come and yet these cliffs might just be the
00:12:11 remnant of a series of deadly pandemics that took place 65 million years ago they are made of chalk a form of
00:12:21 limestone or calcium carbonate made up of tiny grains as fine as powder compacted into solid rock every single one of
00:12:29 these grains is a fossil a tiny mineralized scale that once formed part of a spherical shell
00:12:36 around a single celled alga called a coronavirus lithophore when magnified hundreds of times these
00:12:41 individual cochleaths are intricate discs of surprising complexity combined in their many trillions the
00:12:48 discs are the sole constituent of cliffs more than 100 meters tall these hopeful pure white cliffs are nothing more than an immense
00:12:58 graveyard the remnant of death on a spectacular scale coccolithophores protected in their
00:13:04 calcium carbonate spheres are green algae that float in the surface waters of the oceans
00:13:09 soaking up the sun to power photosynthesis inside their cells but coccolithophores like all life on earth
00:13:18 are not immune to viral infection there is a virus tiny in comparison to the already minuscule algal cells
00:13:25 that can penetrate the protective sphere and penetrate the photosynthesizing cell the boneyards
00:13:31 left behind by these algal pandemics are mere sprinklings of coccolith scales among other sediments that wash over the
00:13:36 ocean floor but at the end of the cretaceous period some 70 million years ago
00:13:42 coccolith graveyards accumulated over tens to hundreds of thousands of years algae bloomed and died bloomed and died
00:13:48 over and over again thickening the layer of chalk mud until it was some half a kilometer thick
00:13:55 and this is still the case millions of years later viruses are constant adversaries of
00:14:00 every living thing and we are doomed to grapple with them in the future as we have done in the distant past
00:14:08 but viruses are capable of more than destruction and our shared history is far more complex
00:14:15 the constant threat of viral infection has in fact been a major driver when an infecting virus damages cells
00:14:26 and brings about disease then a species survival depends on it being able to adapt
00:14:31 to weather the storm or eject the offending particle in this way the immune system has
00:14:36 evolved as a defense in animals and been incrementally improved over millions of years
00:14:42 but this only works for so long in response to the immune defense viruses themselves evolve and adapt it
00:14:49 is a military arms race where it's small with both sides improving their advances until the very nature of the warfare evolves
00:14:58 but there is another unexpected role that viruses have to play in the evolution of life
00:15:03 these tiny inanimate particles behave like genetic messengers between otherwise unrelated organisms
00:15:09 produced in one hijacked cell a virus will be released into the world where it can infect
00:15:13 another possibly belonging to an entirely different species the genes that the viruses carry are
00:15:19 shared between the infected giving them all access to unique traits without having to evolve them from
00:15:26 scratch without their own genetic code the retroviruses which reproduce by inserting their genes into
00:15:33 the dna of their host cells inadvertently gift the host with the instructions for new features which may just turn out
00:15:40 to be beneficial scientists think that a retrovirus that infected early mammals gave them the
00:15:46 instructions for making a new kind of protein which eventually led to the creation of the placenta
00:15:59 in 1990 the human genome project was an outrageous and ambitious effort by scientists all over the world
00:16:08 to read the encyclopedia of human dna it was no small task they were trying to determine the order of some 3 billion
00:16:13 base pairs or characters in the instruction manual of life
00:16:18 had these been written on actual pages they would have filled several hundred volumes but just 13 years after
00:16:23 it began after revolutions in genetic techniques and computing analysis
00:16:31 the human genome project was complete but the work was only just beginning although they now had the ordered
00:16:36 characters of dna in hand it would take another international and multi-disciplinary effort to interpret
00:16:42 what these characters meant the results trickled in over the early years of the 21st century
00:16:48 one of the most shocking revelations was that just a tiny fraction four percent of dna
00:16:55 actually corresponded to the genes that determine our features the rest was something of a mystery for
00:17:01 a long time termed junk dna now we think a lot of it controls when the gene is turned on or off
00:17:10 recently cutting edge science has revealed that some eight percent of the total originated in viruses
00:17:21 specifically retroviruses that smuggle their genes into the unknowing host normally the retroviral redraft only
00:17:27 happens in body cells and can be cloned and copied when the host is alive but disappears when the
00:17:32 infected organism dies but if a retrovirus happens upon a sex cell
00:17:39 an egg or a sperm destined for a new generation then its code is carried forward to be preserved ever
00:17:46 more within the genes of the descendants there's just a minuscule chance of this happening but over millions of years
00:17:53 the retroviral inventory in our cells has gradually grown and now there is twice as much virus in us
00:18:02 then there is us this could be the key to tracing viruses back to the very beginning
00:18:14 paleontologists probe ancient rocks for the fossil remnants of living things and microfossils of tiny bacteria have been
00:18:20 found dating to some three and a half billion years ago but there is no prospect of finding
00:18:25 viral fossils preserved in rocks it is hard enough for viruses to be isolated and imaged accurately in modern samples
00:18:31 let alone those crushed and cooked inside rocks ravaged by time so searching for viral fossils becomes a
00:18:38 subject instead for geneticists who compare through time by sequencing the genomes of humans
00:18:48 animals plants and bacteria geneticists can trace the history of viral infections through time
00:18:54 if a viral sequence is shared by an entire group then it's likely that the group's ancestor was the one
00:19:00 who was infected first recently a group of scientists identified a molecular fossil in our
00:19:07 genome that was also shared by about 25 other mammals including aardvarks marmosets and bats
00:19:12 but this viral fossil seemed to be randomly scattered among the different types of mammals
00:19:17 it was as notable in its absence as in its presence this told an intriguing story of not one
00:19:23 ancient infection but of many a series of viral epidemics that cross species back and forth
00:19:30 infecting unsuspecting animals for some 15 million years although we don't know for sure what the
00:19:36 virus did to these animals what is certain is that its genes are now forever part of our story
00:19:42 just as viral genes seem to have been a part of the story of life perhaps since life itself has been around
00:19:49 and their origins are as indistinct as the origin of life so in search of the first virus
00:19:59 it helps to try and consider how viruses came to be how can something obtain some of the features of life but never
00:20:08 all of them in 2002 just a few short years after the human genome project published the
00:20:23 encyclopedia of life for the first time eckhardt vimer and his team at stony brook university in new york
00:20:29 achieved something that had previously only been the stuff of science fiction or conspiracy they created a virus
00:20:38 from scratch like dr frankenstein they used the advanced and seemingly magical genetic techniques that the
00:20:43 genome project had pioneered to stitch together dna sections in the precise order
00:20:49 to make a simple monster a polio virus related to the wild polio that crippled adults and children in the middle of the
00:20:54 last century something like vemma's breakthrough must have happened naturally in the
00:20:58 biological world sometime in the history of life the result is the viral nanocosmos we see today and
00:21:06 the record of their dna in our cells only the first viruses must have arisen without
00:21:13 the 21st century tools at a geneticist's disposal as for how this viral shadow life can arise naturally
00:21:21 scientists still aren't sure but there are the first is of progressive virus evolution there is a strange phenomenon in most
00:21:36 eukaryotic cells in which small sections of genes can move jumping from one area in the genome
00:21:41 to another it is as if the first page in a book could occasionally jump from the beginning
00:21:48 to the end to somewhere in the middle if these sections of dna acquired the ability to move in and out of a cell
00:21:54 too with the help of a little protein protection then they would have had the same transmissible qualities
00:22:00 of a virus from moving between the pages of a single book these progressive genome fragments could
00:22:05 choose any location in an entire library this explanation best fits the characteristics of retroviruses
00:22:13 which have this compatibility with their host genomes and the unique ability to rewrite their dna
00:22:20 but not all viruses work in this way a second possible theory is one of regression where living cells gradually lose their
00:22:27 metabolic machinery leaving only the basic genes to be passed on to future generations
00:22:33 by dispensing with their intercellular proteins the regressive cell loses its independence it must rely on
00:22:39 another life form to supply the energy and processing power for reproduction it becomes a parasite
00:22:47 we know this has happened with bacteria in the past the bacterial cells that were engulfed to become mitochondria and chloroplasts
00:22:55 inside early eukaryotic cells are now so diminished that they could no longer survive on their own
00:23:01 could this have been the root of viruses too looking at the giant mima viruses with basic proteins alongside the genetic molecule
00:23:09 it is easy to imagine them as having once been alive and independent the scant evidence left
00:23:15 within most viruses means there's little else to decide between the progressive and regressive origin perhaps they are
00:23:20 both correct with different types of viruses arising independently in different ways
00:23:27 throughout history but there is another intriguing possibility viruses are singly adapted for one of
00:23:40 the most fundamental features of life that of reproduction and we know that the very first cells
00:23:50 which originated in the archaean oceans some three and a half billion years ago must have been capable of this
00:23:56 too even before the first cells there must have been a genetic molecule capable of storing and replicating
00:24:02 genetic information for future generations and the iterative evolution of biological metabolism a replicating molecule
00:24:11 without a biological metabolism was probably one of the earliest steps in the evolution
00:24:17 of life from non-life and today we find replicating molecules without a biological metabolism
00:24:25 all around us in viruses in theories of the origin of life a single stranded genetic rna molecule
00:24:31 could have acted as its own replication machinery it is no great leap to imagine single stranded rna viruses
00:24:40 behaving the same way in the absence of living cells to hijack and so in this virus first hypothesis the
00:24:48 viruses didn't break free of life or regress from more advanced living cells but preceded life itself
00:24:56 they could have been a vital step in the origin of all life on earth once true life as we understand it
00:25:02 surrounded itself with a cell and built a self-sustaining metabolism then the viral branch on the tree of
00:25:07 life diverged the earliest viruses themselves evolved building protective protein shells and
00:25:13 devising more efficient ways of replicating themselves using machinery borrowed from the other
00:25:19 branch of life in this way true life and the viral shadow life
00:25:25 were destined to be eternally intertwined viruses there before the first cells and then alongside the first cells ready to hijack
00:25:39 and infect it's an enticing theory but we may never know for certain an unimaginable gulf of time lies between
00:25:46 the modern nanocosmos and the earliest virus but the clues that we can find from galen's view of the unstoppable roman plague
00:25:55 to the geneticists viral fossils written into our very dna suggest that viral infection is
00:26:03 and perhaps always has been a fundamental part you've been watching the entire history
