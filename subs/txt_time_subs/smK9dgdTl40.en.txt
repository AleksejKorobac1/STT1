00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Elon Musk part two the second time we spoke in the podcast with parallels if
00:00:11 not in quality then an outfit to the objectively speaking great a sequel of all-time Godfather Part two as many
00:00:20 people know Elon Musk is a leader of Tesla SpaceX your link and the boring company well maybe less known is that
00:00:28 he's a world-class engineer and designer constantly emphasizing first principles thinking in taking on big engineering
00:00:35 problems that many before him will consider impossible as scientists and engineers most of us don't question the
00:00:43 way things are done we simply follow the momentum of the crowd of revolutionary ideas that change the world on the small
00:00:51 and large scales happen when you return to the fundamentals and ask is there a better way this conversation focuses on
00:00:59 the incredible engineering and innovation done in brain computer interfaces and neural link this work
00:01:07 promises to help treat neurobiological diseases to help us further understand the connection between the individual
00:01:13 neuron to the high-level function of the human brain and finally to one day expand the capacity of the brain through
00:01:21 two-way communication with computational devices the internet and artificial intelligence systems this is the
00:01:28 artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube apple podcasts Spotify supported on patreon or
00:01:36 simply connect with me on Twitter Alex Friedman spelled Fri D ma M and now as an anonymous youtube commenter refer to
00:01:45 our previous conversation as the quote historical first video of two robots conversing without supervision here's
00:01:54 the second time the second conversation with Elon Musk let's start with an easy question about
00:02:02 consciousness in your view is consciousness something that's unique to humans there's is something that
00:02:07 permeates all matter almost like a fundamental force of physics I don't think consciousness permeates
00:02:14 all matter pants I just believe that yeah there's a philosophical how would you tell that's true that's a good point
00:02:22 I believe in scientific message don't blow your mind anything but the scientific method it's like you can't
00:02:26 test the hypothesis then you cannot reach meaningful conclusion that it is true do you think consciousness
00:02:33 understanding consciousness is within the reach of science of the scientific method we can dramatically improve our
00:02:42 understanding of consciousness you know hard pressed to say that we understand anything with complete accuracy but can
00:02:49 we dramatically improve ours that any consciousness I believe the answer is yes this Nai system in your view I have
00:02:57 to have consciousness in order to achieve human-level or superhuman level intelligence does it need to have some
00:03:03 of these human qualities that consciousness may be a body may be a fear of mortality capacity love those
00:03:16 kinds of silly human things it's different you know there's this the scientific method which I very much
00:03:22 believe in where something is true to the degree that it is test ibly so and and otherwise you're really just
00:03:34 talking about you know preferences or full-on untestable beliefs or that you know that kind of thing so ends up being
00:03:44 somewhat of a semantic question where we were conflating a lot of things with the word intelligence if we parse them out
00:03:55 and say you know all we headed towards the future where an AI will be able to out think us in every way then the
00:04:06 answer is unequivocally yes in order for an AI system that needs to out think us in every way it also needs to have a
00:04:13 capacity to have consciousness self-awareness and Anjali will be self-aware yes that's different from
00:04:21 consciousness I need to be in terms words that what consciousness feels like it feels like consciousness is in a
00:04:27 different dimension but this is this could be just an illusion you know if you damnit damage your brain
00:04:36 in some way physically you get you you damage your consciousness which implies that consciousness is a physical
00:04:44 phenomenon and in my view the thing is that that I think are really quite quite likely is that digital intelligence will
00:04:52 be able to out think us in every way and it will soon be able to simulate what we consider consciousness so to agree that
00:04:58 you would not be able to tell the difference and from the from the aspect of the scientific method it's it might
00:05:04 as well be consciousness if we can simulate it perfectly if you can't tell the difference and this is sort of the
00:05:11 Turing test but think of a more sort of advanced version of the Turing test if you if you're if you're talking to a
00:05:19 digital super intelligence and can't tell if that is a computer or a human like let's say just having conversation
00:05:27 of a phone or a video conference or something where you're you you think you're talking look looks like person
00:05:36 makes all of the right inflections and movements and and all the small subtleties that constitute a human and
00:05:45 talks like human makes mistakes like you're hearing like look at that and you literally just can't tell is this are you
00:05:53 really conversing with a person or or an AI might as well wear as well be human so on a darker topic you've expressed
00:06:03 serious concern about existential threats of AI it's perhaps one of the greatest challenges our civilization
00:06:11 faces but since I would say we're kind of an optimistic descendants of apes perhaps we can find several paths of
00:06:18 escaping the harm of AI so if I can give you three options maybe can comment which do you think is the most promising
00:06:26 so one is scaling up efforts on AI safety and beneficial I research and in hope of finding an algorithmic or maybe
00:06:35 a policy solution to is becoming a multiplanetary species as quickly as possible and three is merging with AI
00:06:44 and and riding the wave of that increasing intelligence as it continuously improves what do you think
00:06:50 is most promising most interesting as a civilization that we should invest in I think that's this a lot that responder
00:06:57 investment going on nai whereas a lack of investment is in AI safety and there should be in my view a
00:07:08 cup an agency that oversees anything related to AI to confirm that it is does not represent a public safety risk just
00:07:16 as there is a regulatory authority for this like the Food and Drug Administration is that's the four corner
00:07:22 automotive safety there's the FA for aircraft safety which generally comes a conclusion that it is important to have
00:07:29 a government referee or a referee that is serving the public interest in ensuring that things are safe when when
00:07:37 there's a potential danger to the public I would argue that AI is unequivocally something that has potential to be
00:07:45 dangerous to the public and therefore should have a regulatory agency just as other things that are dangerous to the
00:07:52 public have a regulatory agency but let me tell you problems with this is that the government was very slowly and the
00:08:00 rate of the usually way a regulatory agency comes into being is that something terrible happens
00:08:09 there's a huge public outcry and years after that there's a regulatory agency or rule put in place takes something
00:08:19 like like seatbelts it was known for on a decade or more that seatbelts would have a massive
00:08:27 impact on safety and and save so many lives in serious injuries and the car industry fought the requirements put
00:08:36 seatbelts in tooth and nail that's crazy yeah and and honor hundreds of thousands of people probably died because of that
00:08:43 and they said people wouldn't buy cars if their seatbelts just obviously absurd you know or look at the back tobacco
00:08:49 industry and how long they fought any thing about smoking that's part of why I helped make that movie thank you for smoking
00:08:59 you can sort of see just how pernicious it can be when you have these companies that effectively achieve regulatory
00:09:13 capture of government the bad people in the AG community refer to the advent of digital superintelligence as a
00:09:20 singularity that that is not to say that it is good or bad but it that it is very difficult to predict what will happen
00:09:28 after that point and and that there's some probability it will be bad some probably will be it will be good or if
00:09:34 they want you to affect that probability and have it be more good than bad well let me on the merger with AI question
00:09:42 and the incredible work that's being done in your link there's a lot of fascinating innovation here across
00:09:50 different disciplines going on so the flexible wires the robotic sewing machine that responds to brain movement
00:09:56 everything around ensuring safety and so on so we currently understand very little about the human brain do you also
00:10:07 hope that the work at neural link will help us understand more about our about the human mind about the brain yeah the
00:10:15 work in your like will definitely shut a lot of insight into how the brain the mind works right now just the data we
00:10:23 have regarding the how the brain works is very limited we've collect fMRI which is that that's kind of like putting us
00:10:33 you know a stethoscope on the outside of a factory wall and then putting it like all over the factory wall and you can
00:10:39 sort of hear the sounds but you don't know what machines are doing really yeah it's hard you can infer a few things but
00:10:46 it's very poor brushstroke in order to really know what's going on in the brain you really need you have to have high
00:10:51 precision sensors and then you want to have stimulus and response like if you trigger a new one what how do you feel
00:10:58 what do you see how does it change your perception of the world you're speaking to physically just getting close to the
00:11:03 brain being able to measure signals on the brain yeah will give us sort of open the door and inside the factory yes
00:11:10 being able to have high precision sensors that tell you what individual neurons are doing
00:11:19 and then being able to trigger a neuron and see what the responses in the brain so you can see the consequences of if
00:11:28 you fire this neuron what happens how do you feel what is change it'll be really profound to have this in
00:11:34 people because people can articulate their change like if there's a change in mood or if they've you know if they can
00:11:43 tell you if they can see better or hear better or be able to form sentences better or worse or you know their
00:11:51 memories are jogged or that kinda kind of thing so on the human side there's this
00:11:56 incredible general malleability plasticity of the human brain the human brain adapts adjusts and so on so it's
00:12:03 not that plastic to be totally Frank so there's a firm structure but there nevertheless there's some plasticity and
00:12:10 the open question is so if I could ask a broad question is how much that plasticity can be utilized sort of on
00:12:17 the human side there's some plasticity in human brain and on the machine side we have neural networks machine learning
00:12:26 artificial intelligence it's able to adjust and figure out signals so there's a mysterious language that we don't
00:12:33 perfectly understand that's within the human brain and then we're trying to understand that language to communicate
00:12:40 both directions so the brain is adjusting a little bit we don't know how much and the machine is adjusting where
00:12:47 do you see as they try to sort of reach together almost like with an alien species try to find a protocol
00:12:54 communication protocol that works where do you see the biggest the the biggest benefit arriving from on the machine
00:13:00 side or the human side do you see both of them working together I think the machine side is far more malleable and
00:13:09 the biological side well huge around so it'll be the machine that adapts to the brain that's the only thing that's
00:13:15 possible the brain can adapt that well to to the machine you can't have neurons start to regard an electrode as a nook
00:13:23 another neuron because you're not just dislike the pulse and so something else is pulsing see so this there is that
00:13:30 there is that that elasticity in the inner which we believe is something that can happen but the vast majority of
00:13:37 malleability will have to be on the machine side but it's interesting when you look at that synaptic plasticity at
00:13:44 the interface ID there might be like an emergent plasticity because it's a whole nother it's not like in the brain it's a
00:13:50 whole nother extension of the brain you know we might have to redefine what it means to be malleable for the brain so
00:13:57 maybe the brain is able to adjust to external interfaces there will be some adjustment to the brain because there's
00:14:02 gonna be something reading and simulating the the brain and so it will adjust to to that thing but but well if
00:14:12 the vast majority the adjustment will be on the machine side this is just if this is just it has to be that otherwise it
00:14:20 will not work ultimately like we don't currently operate on two layers we have sort of lamech you like prime primitive
00:14:26 brain layer which is where all of our kind of impulses or coming from it's sort of like we've got we've got like a
00:14:33 monkey brain with a computer stuck on it that's that's the human brain and a lot of our impulses and everything are
00:14:40 driven by the monkey brain and the computer of the cortex is constantly trying to make the Montek monkey brain
00:14:46 happy it's not the cortex that's steering the monkey right it's the monkey brain steering the cortex you
00:14:53 know so the cortex is the part that tells the story of the whole thing so we convince ourselves it's more interesting
00:14:59 than just the monkey brain the cortex just like what we'll call like human intelligence you know it's like that's
00:15:05 like the advanced computer relative to other creatures like other creatures do not have either we're really they don't
00:15:13 they don't have the computer or they have a very weak computer relative to humans but but it's just it's like it sort of
00:15:22 seems like surely the really smart thing should control the dumb thing but actually don't think it rolls this one
00:15:29 thing so do you think some of the same kind of machine learning methods whether that's natural language processing
00:15:35 applications are going to be applied for the communication between the Machine and the brain in to learn how to do
00:15:43 certain things like movement of the body how to process visual stimuli and so on do you see the value of using machine
00:15:52 learning to understand the language of the two-way communication with the brain yeah absolutely maybe we're a neural net
00:16:01 and that you know AI is basically known that so it's like digital neural net will interface with biological neural
00:16:09 net and hopefully bring us along for the ride yeah but the vast majority of aren't of our intelligence will be
00:16:18 digital there's no like so like things like the the difference in intelligence between your the cortex and limbic
00:16:26 system is gigantic your living system really has no comprehension of what the hell the cortex is doing it's just
00:16:36 literally hungry you know or tired or angry or sexy or something you know it's an ad just and then it that communicates
00:16:47 that's that impulse to the cortex and Tails the cortex to go satisfy that then a great deal of like a massive amount of
00:16:56 thinking like truly this stupendous amount of thinking has gone into sex without purpose without provocation
00:17:05 without procreation which which is actually quite a silly action in the absence of procreation it's a bit silly
00:17:14 the one why you doing it that's because it makes the limbic system happy that's why that's why but it's pretty absurd
00:17:23 really well the whole of existence is pretty absurd in some kind of sense yeah but I mean this does a lot of
00:17:29 computation has gone into how can I do more of that with the co-creation not even being a
00:17:36 factor this is I think a very important area of research for NSFW an agency that should receive a lot of funding
00:17:44 especially after this decision if I propose the formation of a new agency oh boy what is the most exciting or some of the
00:17:56 most exciting things that you see in the future impact of neural link both on the size engineering a societal broad impact
00:18:04 so in your link I think that first will solve a lot of brain related diseases so creating from like autism schizophrenia
00:18:13 memory loss like everyone experiences memory loss that at certain point in in age parents can't remember their kids
00:18:20 names and that kind of thing so there's like mount of good that neural link can do in solving a critical critical damage
00:18:30 to brain or the spinal cord there's a lot that can be done to improve quality of life of individuals and that will be
00:18:37 those three steps along the way and then ultimately it's intended to address the the risk of the existential risks
00:18:45 associated with digital super intelligence like we will not feel to be smarter than a digital supercomputer so
00:18:56 therefore if you cannot beat them join them and released we won't have that option so you have hope that your link will be
00:19:07 able to be a kind of connection to allow us to to merge to ride the wave of the improving AI systems I think the chances
00:19:17 above zero percent it's nonzero yeah there's a chance and that's so what I've seen dumb and dumber yes so I'm saying
00:19:25 there's a chance he's saying one in a billion or one in a million whatever it was the dumb and dumber you know it went
00:19:30 from maybe one a million to improving maybe it'll be one in a thousand and then 100 then one in ten depends on the
00:19:37 rate of improvement of neural link and how fast we're able to do make progress you know well I've talked to a few folks
00:19:44 here quite brilliant engineers some I'm excited yeah I think it's like fundamentally good you know who you know
00:19:50 giving somebody back full motor control after they've had a spinal cord injury you know restoring brain functionality
00:19:59 after a stroke solving debilitating genetically orange brain diseases these are all incredibly great I think and in
00:20:06 order to do these you have to be able to interface with the neurons at detail level and each build fire they're not
00:20:12 write neurons read the write neurons and and then effectively you can create a circuit replace what's broken with with
00:20:23 silicon and actually fill in them the missing functionality and then over time we can have with develop a tertiary
00:20:32 layer so if like limbic system is a primary layer then the cortex is like a sector the second layer now and I said
00:20:38 that you know the cortex is vastly more intelligent than the limbic system but people generally like the fact that they
00:20:44 have a living system and a cortex I've met anyone who wants to lead either one of them there like a girl keeping both
00:20:49 that's cool the limbic system is kind of fun tell us what the fun is absolutely and then you people generally don't lose the
00:20:58 cortex either all right they're like having the cortex and the limbic system yeah and and then there's a tertiary
00:21:03 layer which will be digital super intelligence and I think there's room for optimism given that the cortex the
00:21:12 cortex is very intelligent and limbic system is not and yet they work together well perhaps they can be a tertiary
00:21:19 layer where digital super intelligence lies and that that will be vastly more intelligent than the cortex but still
00:21:26 coexist peacefully and in the end of an EIN manner with the cortex and limbic system that's a super exciting future
00:21:32 both on the low-low of engineering that I saw is being done here and actual possibility in the next few decades it's
00:21:39 important that Norling solved this problem sooner rather than later because the point at which we have digital super
00:21:45 intelligence that's when we pass the singularity and and things become just very uncertain it doesn't mean that
00:21:50 they're necessarily bad or good for the point which we passed singularity things become extremely unstable so we want to
00:21:57 have a human brain interface before the singularity or at least not long after it to minimize existential risk for
00:22:05 Humanity and consciousness as we know it but there's a lot of fascinating actual engineering a low-level problems here at
00:22:13 your link that yeah quite quite exciting what the problems that we face in your like art material science Electrical
00:22:21 Engineering software mechanical engineering micro fabrication it's a bunch of engineering disciplines
00:22:27 essentially that's where it comes down to you have to have a a tiny electrode so so small it doesn't hurt hurt neurons
00:22:38 but it's got to last for as long as a person so it's gonna last for decades and then you've got to take that signal
00:22:46 you've got to process that single looks signal locally at low power so we need a lot of chip design engineers that you
00:22:54 know cuz we're gonna do signal processing and do so in a very power efficient way so that we don't heat your
00:23:02 brain up because the brain is very heat sensitive and then and then we're going to take those signals I'm going to do
00:23:07 something with them and then we better stimulate interest of stimulate the back too you know so you could buy
00:23:17 directional communication so he's good at material science software mechanical engineering Electrical Engineering trip
00:23:24 design micro fabrication that's what those are the things we need to work on we need to a good material science so
00:23:30 that the we can have tiny electrodes that last a long time and as the tough thing with the science problems a tough
00:23:37 one because you're trying to read and simulate electrically in a an electrically active area your brain is
00:23:45 very electrically active in electro chemically active so how do you have a coating on the electrode that doesn't
00:23:55 dissolve over time and and is safe in the brain this is a very hard problem and then and then how do you collect
00:24:05 those signals in a way that is most efficient because you really just have very tiny amounts of power to process
00:24:12 those signals you know and then we need to automate the whole thing so it's like LASIK you know so it's just it's it's
00:24:19 not if this is done by neurosurgeons there's no way it can scale to large numbers of people and it needs to scales
00:24:24 large numbers of people because I think ultimately we want the future repeated to be determined by a large number of
00:24:33 the of humans do you think that this has a chance to revolutionize surgery period so neurosurgery and Ellis yeah for sure
00:24:41 it's gotta be like lazy like you met if LASIK had to be hand done not done by hand by a person that wouldn't be great
00:24:52 you know it's done by a robot and they'll off the mall it just kind of just needs to make sure
00:24:57 yo-you heads in my position and then they just press button and go it's a smart summon and soon Auto Park takes on
00:25:05 the full beautiful mess of parking lots and their human human nonverbal communication I think it has actually
00:25:13 the potential to have a profound impact in changing how our civilization looks at AI in robotics because this is the
00:25:20 first time human beings people that don't own and test them Eve never seen it doesn't hurt about a Tesla get to
00:25:26 watch hundreds of thousands of cars without a driver yeah do you see it this way almost like an education tool for
00:25:34 the world about AI do you feel the burden of that the excitement of that or do you just think it's a smart parking feature
00:25:42 I do think you are getting at something important which is most people have never really seen a robot or at and what
00:25:48 what is the card that is autonomous it's a four wheeled robot yeah the it communicates a certain sort of message
00:25:55 with everything from safety to the possibility of what AI could bring his current limitations its current
00:26:02 challenges its what's possible do you feel the burden of that almost like a communicator educator to the world about
00:26:09 AI we were just really trying to make fuels lives easier with autonomy but now you mention it I think it will be an
00:26:16 eye-opener to people about robotics because they have really never seen most people never seen a robot and are
00:26:23 hundreds of thousands of Tesla's won't be long before there's a million of them that have autonomous capability and the
00:26:30 drive without a person in it and you use you can see the kind of evolution of the cars personality and and thinking with
00:26:40 each iteration of autopilot you can see it's it's uncertain about this or it gets it but now it's more certain now
00:26:48 now it's moving in a slightly different way like I can tell immediately if a car is on tells autopilot because got just
00:26:56 little nuances of movement it just moves in a slightly different way it will cause aunt Ella for example on the
00:27:02 highway are far more precise about being in the center of the lane than a person if you drive down the highway and look
00:27:07 at how at where cars are the human driven cars are in within their lane that like bumper
00:27:14 cars then like moving all over the place the car and autopilot dead center yes of the incredible work that's going
00:27:22 into that in your network it's learning fast autonomy is still very very hard we don't actually know how hard it is fully
00:27:32 of course you look at the most problems you tackle this one included in with an exponential lens but even with an
00:27:39 exponential improvement things can take longer than expected sometimes so where does Tesla currently stand on its quest
00:27:49 for full autonomy what's your sense when can we see successful deployment of full autonomy well on the highway already the
00:27:59 the probability of an intervention is extremely low yes so for highway autonomy with latest
00:28:08 release especially the probability of need to intervene is this query is really quite low in fact I'd say for
00:28:16 stop-and-go traffic did its Matt as far safer than a person right now it's not forget the probability of an injury or
00:28:22 an impact is much much lower for a pilot in a person and it was navigating
00:28:28 change lanes take highway interchanges and then we're coming at it from the other direction which is low speed full
00:28:35 autonomy and in a way this is like it's like how does a person learn to drive you learn to drive in parking lot you
00:28:40 know you know first time you learn to drive probably wasn't jumping on Wolcott Street in San Francisco
00:28:46 that'd be crazy you're driving in the parking lot get things get things right at low speed and and then the missing
00:28:54 piece that were working on is traffic lights and stuff streets dr. Esau streets obviously actually also
00:29:01 relatively easy because you know you kind of know where the stuff Street is was casing geocoded and then use
00:29:06 visualization to see where the line is and stop the line to illuminate the GPS are so it actually this is probably
00:29:17 complex traffic lights and very windy roads are the two things that need to get sold what's harder perception of
00:29:24 control for these problems so being able to perfectly perceive everything or figuring out a plan once you perceive
00:29:31 everything how to interact with all the agents in the environment in your sense from a learning perspective is
00:29:39 perception or action harder and then giant beautiful multitask learning neural network the hardest thing is
00:29:45 having a kur representation of the physical objects in vector space so transportation the visual input
00:29:54 primarily visual input some sonar and radar and and then at creating the an accurate vector space representation of
00:30:03 the objects around you once you have an accurate vectors based representation the flanker and control is relatively
00:30:10 easier it is relatively easy basically once you have accurate vector representation then then you're kind of
00:30:17 like a video game like it cars in like Grand Theft Auto or something like they work pretty well they drive down the
00:30:23 road they don't crash you know pretty much unless you crash into them that's because they've they've got an accurate
00:30:28 vectors based representation of where the cars are and they're just bent and then they're rendering that as the as
00:30:34 the output you have a sense high level that Tesla's on track on being able to achieve full autonomy so on the highway
00:30:43 yeah yeah absolutely and still no driver state as a driver sensing and we have driver sensing with
00:30:52 talk in the wheel that's right yeah by the way just a quick comment on karaoke most people think it's fun
00:30:59 but I also think it's a driving feature I've been saying for a long time singing in a car is really good for attention
00:31:04 management and vigilance management  sorry Tesla karaoke again it's great it's the one of the most fun features of
00:31:10 the car do you think of a connection between fun and safety sometimes yeah they're both the same time that's great
00:31:18 I just met with and ruin wife of  Carl Sagan oh yeah directed cut cosmos I'm generally a big fan of Paul Sagan he's
00:31:26 super cool and they had a great way of bringing things all that consciousness all civilization
00:31:31 everything we've ever known and done is on this tiny blue dot people also get they get too trapped in there this is
00:31:39 like squabbles amongst humans and this don't think of a big picture they take civilization and not continuing
00:31:45 existence for granted I shouldn't do that look at the history of civilizations their eyes and they fall
00:31:53 and now civilization is all it's globalized and so we're civilization I think now rises and falls together
00:32:02 there's no there's not geographic isolation this is a big risk things don't always go up that should be that's
00:32:14 an important lesson of history in 1990 at the request of Carl Sagan the Voyager 1 spacecraft which is a spacecraft
00:32:20 that's reaching out farther than anything human made into space turned around to take a picture of Earth from
00:32:27 3.7 billion the way and as you're talking about the pale blue dot that picture there takes
00:32:34 up less than a single pixel in that image you know appearing as a tiny blue dot as pale blue dot as Carl Sagan called it so
00:32:46 he spoke about this dot of ours in 1994 and if you could humor me I was wondering if in the last two minutes you
00:32:55 could read the words that he wrote described in this buildup sure yes finally the universe appears to be 13.8
00:33:08 earth-like four-and-a-half billion years old you know another half billion years or so the Sun will expand and probably
00:33:18 evaporate the oceans and make life impossible on earth which means that if it had taken consciousness temp sent
00:33:24 longer to evolve it would never have balled it all its attempts and longer and I wonder I wonder how many dead one
00:33:35 planet civilizations that are out there in the cosmos that never made it to the other planet and ultimately extinguish
00:33:42 themselves or were destroyed by external factors probably a few it's only just possible to try to travel to Mars just
00:33:56 barely if G was 10% more wouldn't work really if it empty was 10% lower it would be easy plucking go single stage from
00:34:06 surface of module away surface of the earth there's Mars it's 37-cent with gravity they're about a giant blue stick you
00:34:21 know forth channeling Costigan look again at that dot that's here that's home that's us on it everyone you love
00:34:31 everyone you know everyone you've ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives the aggregate of
00:34:39 our joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and
00:34:44 forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every King and peasant every young
00:34:53 couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and Explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt
00:35:04 politician every superstar every Supreme Leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a
00:35:13 mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark in our
00:35:21 obscurity in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves the
00:35:27 earth is the only world known so far to harbor life there is nowhere else at least in the near future to which our
00:35:35 species could migrate this is not true this is Fault Mars and I think Carl Sagan would agree with that
