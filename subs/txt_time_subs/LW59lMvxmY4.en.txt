00:00:01 the following is a conversation with David Chalmers he's a philosopher and cognitive scientist specializing in the
00:00:07 areas of philosophy of mind philosophy language and consciousness he's perhaps best known for formulating
00:00:15 the hard problem of consciousness which could be stated as why does the feeling which accompanies awareness of sensory
00:00:23 information exists at all consciousness is almost entirely mystery many people who worry about AI safety in ethics
00:00:31 believe that in some form consciousness can and should be engineered into AI systems of the future so while there's
00:00:38 much mystery disagreement and discoveries yet to be made about consciousness these conversations while
00:00:44 fundamentally philosophical in nature may nevertheless be very important for engineers of modern AI systems to engage

00:02:26 living in a simulation I don't rule it out there's probably going to be a lot of simulations in the history of the
00:02:33 cosmos if the simulation is designed well enough it'll be indistinguishable from a non simulated reality and
00:02:42 although we could keep searching for evidence that were not in a simulation any of that evidence in principle could
00:02:49 be simulated so I think it's a possibility but do you think the thought experiment is interesting or useful to
00:02:57 calibrate how we think about the nature of reality yeah I definitely think it's interesting and useful in fact I'm
00:03:03 actually writing a book about this right now all about the simulation idea using it to shed light on a whole bunch of
00:03:11 philosophical questions so you know the big one is how do we know anything about the external world Descartes said you
00:03:18 know maybe you're being fooled by an evil demon who's stimulating your brain and thinking all this stuff is real when
00:03:26 in fact it's all made up well the modern the modern version of that is how do you know you're not in a simulation then the
00:03:33 thought is if you're in a simulation none of this is real so that's teaching you something to give
00:03:37 out about knowledge how do you know about the external world I think there's also really interesting questions about
00:03:43 the nature of reality right here I mean if we are in a simulation is all this real is there really a table here is it
00:03:49 really a microphone do I really have a body the standard view would be no we don't none of this would be real my view
00:03:57 is actually that's wrong and even if we are in a simulation all of this is real that's why I called
00:04:02 this reality 2.0 new version of reality different version of reality still reality so what's the difference between
00:04:10 quote-unquote real world and the world that we perceive so that we interact with the world to the world by
00:04:20 perceiving it it only really exists through the window of our perception system and in our mind so
00:04:27 differs means something that's quote-unquote real that exists perhaps without us being there and and the the
00:04:36 world a as you perceive it well the world as we perceive it as a very simplified and distorted version of
00:04:43 what's going on underneath we already know that from just thinking about science you know you don't see too many
00:04:48 obviously quantum mechanical effects and what we what we perceive but we still know quantum mechanics is going on under
00:04:54 all things so I like to think the world we perceive is this very kind of simplified picture of colors and shapes
00:05:04 existing and in space and so on we know there's a that's what the philosopher Wilfrid Sellars called the manifest
00:05:11 image the world as it seems to us we already know underneath all that is a very different scientific image with
00:05:18 atoms or quantum wave functions or super strings or whatever the the latest thing is and that's the ultimate scientific
00:05:25 reality so I think of the simulation idea as basically another hypothesis about what the ultimate se quasi
00:05:34 scientific or metaphysical reality is going on underneath the world with a manifest image the world of the manifest
00:05:41 image is this very simple thing that we interact with it's neutral on the underlying stuff of reality science
00:05:48 could help tell us about that maybe philosophy could help tell us about that - and if we eventually take the red pill
00:05:54 and find out we're in a simulation in my view is that's just another view about what reality is made of you know the
00:06:01 philosopher Immanuel Kant said what is the nature of the thing in itself I've got a glass here and it's got all these
00:06:07 it appears to me a certain way a certain shape it's liquid it's clear and he said what is the nature of the thing and
00:06:15 itself well I think of the simulation idea it's a hypothesis about the nature of the thing in itself it turns out if
00:06:21 we're in a simulation the thing in itself nature of this glass okay it's actually a bunch of data structures
00:06:27 running on a on a computer in the next universe up yeah that's what people tend to do and they think about simulation
00:06:33 they think about our modern computers and somehow trivially crudely just scaled up and
00:06:44 but do you think the simulation I mean in order to actually simulate something as complicated as our universe that's
00:06:53 made up of molecules and atoms and particles and quarks and maybe even strings all of that requires something
00:07:01 just infinitely many orders of magnitude more of scale and complexity do you think we're even able to even like
00:07:13 conceptualize what it would take to simulate our universe or does it just slip into this idea that you basically
00:07:22 have to build a universe something so big to simulate it is that it just get this into this fuzzy area that's not
00:07:30 useful at all yeah well obviously I mean our universe is obviously incredibly complicated and for us within our
00:07:37 universe to build a simulation of a universe as complicated as ours is gonna have obvious problems here if the
00:07:44 universe is finite there's just no way that's gonna work maybe there's some cute way to make it work if the universe
00:07:51 is a is a is infinite maybe an infinite universe could somehow simulate a copy of itself but that's a that's gonna be hard
00:07:58 nonetheless just that we are in a simulation I think there's no particular reason why we have to think the
00:08:04 simulating universe has to be anything like ours you've said before that it might be so you can think of it and
00:08:13 Turtles all the way down you could think of the simulating universe different than ours but we ourselves could also
00:08:20 create another simulating universe so you said there could be these kind of levels of universes and you've also
00:08:27 mentioned this hilarious idea maybe tongue-in-cheek maybe not that there may be simulations within simulations
00:08:34 arbitrarily stacked levels and that there may be that we may be in level 42 oh yeah along those stacks referencing
00:08:41 Hitchhiker's Guide to the universe if we're indeed in a simulation within a simulation at level 42 what do you think
00:08:52 level zero looks like there right would expect that zero is truly enormous I mean not just
00:08:59 if it's finite it's some extraordinarily large finite capacity much more likely its infinite maybe it's a maybe it's got
00:09:05 something very high etcetera to cardinalities that enables it to support just any number of any number of
00:09:13 simulations so high degree of infinity at level zero slight little slightly smaller degree of infinity at at level
00:09:20 one so by the time you get down to us at level 42 maybe plenty of room for lots of simulations of finite capacity if the
00:09:33 top universe is only a small finite capacity then obviously that's going to put very very serious limits on how many
00:09:39 simulations are going to be able to be able to get running so I think we can certainly confidently say that if we
00:09:45 hurt level 42 then the top level is pretty pretty damn big so it gets more and more constrained as we get down
00:09:52 levels more and more simplified and constrained and limited resources and you know we still have plenty of
00:09:58 capacity here what was it a Fineman 30 said there's plenty of room at the bottom you know we're still you know
00:10:03 we're still a number of levels above the degree where there's room for fundamental computing physical computing
00:10:10 capacity quantum computing capacity at the bottom level so we got plenty of room to play with and make we probably
00:10:16 have plenty of room for simulations of pretty sophisticated universes perhaps none as complicated as our universe
00:10:25 unless our universes is infinite but still it's very least for pretty serious finite universes but maybe universes
00:10:32 somewhat simpler than ours unless of course we're prepared to take certain shortcuts in the simulation which might
00:10:37 then increase their capacity significantly do you think the the human mind us people in terms of the
00:10:45 complexity of simulation as at the height of what the simulation might be able to achieve like if you look at
00:10:51 incredible entities that could be created in this universe of ours do you have an intuition about how incredible
00:11:00 human beings are on that scale I think we're pretty impressive we're not that impressive are we above average
00:11:08 I mean I think high human beings are a certain point in the scale of intelligence which made many things
00:11:15 possible you know you get through evolution through single-cell organisms through fish and mammals and primates
00:11:25 and something happens once you get to human beings we've just reached that level where we get to develop language
00:11:31 we get to develop certain kinds of culture or maybe get to develop certain kinds of collective thinking that has
00:11:38 enabled all this amazing stuff to happen science and literature and engineering and culture and and so on so we had just
00:11:46 at the beginning of that on the evolutionary threshold it's kind of like we just got there you know who knows a
00:11:53 few thousands or tens of thousands of years ago so we're probably just at the very beginning for what's possible there
00:12:00 so I'm inclined to think among the scale of intelligent beings we're somewhere very near the bottom I would expect that
00:12:08 for example if we're in a if we're in a simulation then the simulators who created a sir got the capacity to be far
00:12:15 more sophisticated for at level 42 who knows what the ones at level zero I like it's also possible that this is the
00:12:23 epitome of what is possible to achieve so we as human beings see ourselves maybe as flawed see all the constraints
00:12:30 all the limitations but maybe that's the magical the beautiful thing maybe those limitations are the
00:12:37 essential elements for an interesting sort of that edge of chaos that interesting existence that if you make
00:12:45 us much more intelligent if if you make us much more powerful in any kind of dimension of performance maybe you lose
00:12:53 something fundamental that makes life worth living so you kind of have this optimistic view of where this little
00:13:01 baby that and there's so much growth and potential but this could also be it well this is the most amazing thing is us
00:13:11 maybe what you're saying is consistent with what I'm saying I mean we can still have levels of intelligence far beyond
00:13:16 us but maybe those levels of intelligence on your view would be kind of boring and
00:13:20 you know we get kind of get so good at everything that life suddenly becomes uni-dimensional so we're just in happening in happening
00:13:28 this once part of like maximal romanticism and history of evolution yes you get to humans and it's like yeah and
00:13:34 then years to come our super intelligent descendents are gonna look back at us and say those were the days when and
00:13:40 they just hit the point of inflection and life was interesting I am an optimist so I'd like to think that you
00:13:46 know if there is super intelligence somewhere in the in the future they'll figure out how to make life super
00:13:53 interesting and super romantic when you know what they're gonna do it so what they're gonna do is they realize how
00:13:57 boring life is when you're super intelligent so they created a new level of a simulation and sort of live through
00:14:06 the things they've created by watching them stumble about in their flawed ways so maybe that's so you create a new
00:14:14 level of a simulation every time you get really bored with how smart and this would be kind of sad though because it
00:14:20 would show the peak of their existence would be like watching simulations for entertainment by saying the peak of our
00:14:27 existence now is Netflix know it's alright a flipside of that could be the peak of our existence for many people
00:14:33 having children and watching them grow that becomes very meaningful okay so create a simulation it's like
00:14:39 creating a family creating like well any kind of creation is  it's kind of a powerful act dealing is easier to
00:14:47 simulate the mind or the universe so I've heard several people including Nick Bostrom think about ideas of you know
00:14:55 maybe you don't need to simulate the universe you can just simulate the human mind or in general just the distinction
00:15:02 between simulating this the entirety of it the entirety the physical world or just simulating the mind which one do
00:15:10 you see is more challenging well I think in some sense the answer is is obvious it has to be simpler to simply simulate
00:15:15 the mind than to simulate the universe because the mind is part of the universe and in order to fully simulate the
00:15:21 universe you're gonna have to simulate the mind's eye just by talking about partial simulations and I guess the
00:15:28 question is which comes first there's a mind come before the universe or does the universe come before the mind
00:15:35 so the mind could just be an emergent phenomena in this universe so simulation is a is an interesting thing that you
00:15:46 know it's it's not like creating a simulation perhaps requires you to program every single thing that happens
00:15:51 in it it's just defining a set of initial conditions and rules based on which
00:16:00 could behaves mm-hmm simulating the mind requires you to have a little bit more we're now in a little bit of a crazy lab
00:16:10 but it requires you to understand the fundamentals of cognition perhaps of consciousness of perception of
00:16:18 everything like that that's me that's not created through some kind of emergence from basic physics laws but
00:16:27 more requires you to actually understand the fundamentals of the mind how about if we said to simulate the brain the
00:16:33 brain rather than rather than the mind the brain is just a big physical system the universe is a giant physical system
00:16:39 I simulate the universe at the very least you're going to have to simulate the brains as well as all the other
00:16:47 physical systems within it and you know it's not obvious there's that the problems are any worse for the for the
00:16:54 brain than for its particularly complex physical system but if we can simulate arbitrary physical systems we can
00:17:00 simulate brains there is this further question of whether when you simulate a brain will that bring along all the
00:17:07 features of the mind with it like will you get my consciousness will you get thinking will you get free will and so
00:17:13 on and that's that's something philosophers ever have argued over for four years my own view is if you see if
00:17:20 you simulate the brain well enough that will also simulate the mind but yeah there's plenty of people who would say
00:17:27 no you'd merely get like a zombie system a simulation of a brain without any true consciousness but for you you put
00:17:34 together a brain the consciousness comes with it arise yeah I don't think it's obvious that's your intuition my view is
00:17:42 roughly that yeah what is responsible for consciousness it's in the patents of information processing and so on rather
00:17:50 than say the biology that it's made of there's certainly plenty of people out there who think consciousness has to be
00:17:55 say biological so if you merely replicate the patterns of information processing in a non-biological substrate
00:18:01 you'll miss what's crucial for consciousness I mean I think just don't think there's any particular reason to
00:18:07 think that biology is special here you can imagine substituting the biology for non biological systems a silicon
00:18:15 circuits that play the same role the behavior will continue to be the same and you know I think just the key about
00:18:21 what is the true I when I think about the connection the isomorphisms between consciousness and the brain the deepest
00:18:27 connections to me seemed to connect consciousness to patterns of information processing not specific biology so I at
00:18:34 least adopted as my working hypothesis that basically it's the computation and the information that matters for
00:18:40 consciousness the same time we don't understand consciousness it should be wrong so the computation the flow the
00:18:49 processing manipulation of information the the process is where the consciousness the software is where the
00:18:56 consciousness comes from not the hardware roughly the software yeah the patterns of information processing at
00:19:03 least in the in the hardware which we could view as as software it may not be some of you just like program and load
00:19:11 and erase and so on and the way we can with ordinary software but it's something at the level of information
00:19:16 processing rather than have a level of implementation so on that what do you think of the experience of self just the
00:19:25 experience of the world in a virtual world in virtual reality is it possible that we can create sort of offsprings of
00:19:36 our consciousness by existing in a virtual world long enough so yeah ok can we be conscious in in the same kind of
00:19:46 deep way that we are in this real world by hanging out in a virtual world yeah well the kind of virtual worlds we
00:19:55 have now or you know or interesting but limited in certain ways in particular they relying on us having a brain and so on
00:20:03 which is outside the virtual world maybe I'll strap on my VR headset I'll just hang out in a in a virtual world on a on
00:20:13 a screen but my brain and then the physical my physical environment might be simulated if I'm in a virtual world
00:20:19 but right now there's no attempt to simulate my brain I might Hank there might be some non player characters and
00:20:25 these are in these virtual worlds that have simulated cognitive systems of certain kinds that dictate their
00:20:31 behavior but you know mostly they're pretty simple right now I mean some people are trying to combine put a bit
00:20:37 of AI and then non-player characters to make them to make them them smarter but for now inside virtual world the actual
00:20:45 thinking is interestingly distinct from the physics of those virtual worlds in a way actually I like to think this is
00:20:49 kind of reminiscent of the way that Descartes thought our physical world was there's physics and there's the mind and
00:20:56 they're separate now we now we think the mind is somehow somehow connected to physics pretty deeply but in these
00:21:01 virtual worlds there's a physics of a virtual world and then there's this brain which is totally outside the
00:21:06 virtual world that controls it and interacts if when anyone anyone exercises agency in a video game and you
00:21:12 know that's actually somebody outside the virtual world moving a controller controlling the interaction of things
00:21:19 inside the virtual world so right now in virtual worlds the mind is somehow outside the world but you could imagine
00:21:26 in the future once we get once we have developed serious AI artificial general intelligence and so on then we could
00:21:34 come to virtual worlds which have enough sophistication you could actually simulate a brain or have a genuine AGI
00:21:43 which were then presumably be able to act in equally sophisticated ways maybe even more sophisticated ways inside the
00:21:50 virtual world to how it might in the physical world and then the question is going to come along that would be kind
00:21:57 of a VR into a virtual world internal intelligence and then the question is could they have consciousness experience
00:22:04 intelligence free will yes all the things that we have and again my view is I don't see why not
00:22:10 to linger in a little bit I find virtual reality really incredibly powerful just even the crude virtual
00:22:18 reality we have now perhaps there's a there's a psychological effects that's makes some people more amenable to
00:22:25 virtual worlds and others but I find myself wanting to stay in virtual worlds for free yes with a headset or on a
00:22:33 desktop no with a headset really interesting because I I am totally addicted yet using the internet and
00:22:41 things on a on a desktop but when it comes to VR for the headset I don't typically use it for more than 10 or 20
00:22:47 minutes there's something just slightly aversive about it I find so I don't right now even though I have oculus rift
00:22:54 an oculus quest an HTC vive and Samsung listen that I want to stay in now for extended periods use you actually find
00:23:02 yourself the something about him it's a both a combination of just imagination and considering the possibilities of
00:23:10 where this goes in in the future it feels like I want to almost prepare my brain for like it I want to explore sort
00:23:20 of Disneyland when it's first being built in the early days yeah and it feels like I'm walking around almost
00:23:31 imagining the possibilities and something through that process allows my mind to really enter into that world but
00:23:39 you say that the brain is external to that virtual world it is strictly speaking true but if you're in VR and
00:23:50 you do brain surgery on an avatar and you can open up that skull what are you gonna find sorry nothing there nothing
00:23:56 the brain is elsewhere you don't think it's possible to kind of separate them and I don't mean in a sense like decart
00:24:06 like a hard separation but basically do you think it's possible with the brain outside of the virtual grid when you're
00:24:15 wearing a headset create a new consciousness for prolonged periods of time really feel like really experience
00:24:26 forget that human brain is outside so this is okay this is gonna be the case where the brain is still outside still
00:24:31 outside but could living in the VR I mean I mean we already find this right with video games
00:24:38 exactly completely immersive and you get taken up by living in those worlds and it becomes your reality for a while so
00:24:45 they're not completely immersive it's very immersive you don't you don't forget the external world no exactly so
00:24:51 if that's what I'm asking yeah it's almost possible to really forget the external world really really immerse
00:24:59 yourself what to forget completely why would we forget you know we got pretty good memories maybe you can stop paying
00:25:06 attention to the external world but you know that this already happens a lot I go to work and maybe I'm not paying
00:25:11 attention to my home life if I go to s I go to a movie and I'm immersed in that so that degree of emotion absolutely but
00:25:19 we still have the capacity to remember it to completely forget the external world I'm thinking that would probably
00:25:24 take some I don't know some pretty serious drugs or something to make your s but it's to make your brain do that
00:25:30 possible so I mean I guess I'm getting at is consciousness a truly a property that's tied to the the physical brain or
00:25:44 can it can you create sort of different offspring copies of consciousness is based on the worlds that you enter well
00:25:51 the way we're doing it now at least with a standard VR there's just one brain interact for the physical world plays a
00:25:59 video game puts on a video headset interacts with this virtual world and I think we typically say there's one
00:26:05 consciousness here that nonetheless undergoes different environments takes on different characters you know in
00:26:12 different environments this is already something that happens in the non virtual world you know I might interact
00:26:18 one way in my home life work life social life and so on so at the very least that will happen in a in a virtual world very
00:26:27 naturally people might people have very people sometimes adopt the character of avatars very different from themselves
00:26:33 maybe even a different gender or different race different social background so that much is certainly possible I
00:26:40 would see that as a single consciousness is singing on different personas if you want literal splitting of consciousness
00:26:48 into multiple copies I think it's gonna take something more radical than that like maybe you can run different
00:26:54 simulations of your brain in different realities and then expose them to different histories and then you know
00:27:00 you just put yourself into 10 different simulated copies which then undergo different environments and then
00:27:06 ultimately do become 10 very different consciousness maybe that could happen but now we're not talking about
00:27:11 something that's possible in the near term we're gonna have to have brain simulations and AGI for that to happen
00:27:20 got it so before any of that happens it's fundamentally you see it as a singular consciousness even though it's
00:27:26 experiencing different environments which are not it's still connected to same set of memories same set of
00:27:33 experiences and therefore one sort of joint conscious system yeah or at least no more multiple than the kind of
00:27:42 multiple consciousness that we get from and have inhabiting different environments and in a non virtual world
00:27:50 so you said as a child you were a music color Senna famously synesthete so we're songs had colors for you
00:27:59 so what songs had what colors you know this is funny I didn't paint much attention to this at the time but I've
00:28:05 listened to a piece of music and I'd get some kind of imagery of a of a kind of a kind of color of the wid thing is mostly
00:28:17 they were okay murky dark greens and olive browns and the colors went all that interesting I don't know what the
00:28:24 reason is I mean my theory is that maybe it's like different cords and tones provided different colors and the old
00:28:30 tended to get mixed together into these somewhat uninteresting browns and greens but every now and then there'd be
00:28:37 something that had a really pure color so this just a few that I did I remember it was a here there and everywhere by
00:28:44 the Beatles was bright red and has this you know very distinctive tonality and it's chord structure at the at the
00:28:50 beginnings of that right red it was a song by the Alan Parsons Project called ammonia Avenue
00:28:58 that was it was kind of a pure a pure blue anyway I've got no idea how would this happen didn't even pay that much
00:29:04 attention until it went away when I was about 20 this synesthesia often goes away so is it purely just the perception
00:29:11 of a particular color or was there a positive or negative experience with it like was blue associate with a positive
00:29:18 and red with a negative or is it simply the perception of color associate with some characteristic of the song for me I
00:29:25 don't remember a lot of association with with emotion or what the value was just this kind of weird and interesting fact
00:29:31 I mean at the beginning I thought this was something that happened to everyone songs have colors maybe I mentioned it
00:29:40 once or twice and people said no no ed it was like I thought was kind of cool when there was one that had one of these
00:29:45 especially pure colors but only much later once I became a grad student thinking about the mind that I read
00:29:51 about this phenomenon called synesthesia it's like hey that's what I had and now I occasionally talk about it in my
00:29:57 classes in intro class and still happens sometimes a student comes up and says hey I have that I never knew about that
00:30:05 I never knew it had a name you said they want to run away at age 20 or so and the you have a journal entry from around and
00:30:14 saying songs don't have colors anymore what happened what happened yeah I was definitely sad that it was gone in
00:30:20 retrospect there's like hey that's cool the colors have gone yeah do you can you think about that for a little bit do you
00:30:28 miss those experiences because it's a fundamentally different sets of experiences that you no longer have
00:30:35 mm-hmm or deed or is it just a nice thing to have had you don't see them as that fundamentally different than you
00:30:43 visiting a new country and experiencing new environments I guess for me when I had these experiences they were somewhat
00:30:49 marginal they were like a little bonus kind of experience I know there are people have much more serious forms of
00:30:57 synesthesia than this for whom it's absolutely central to their lives I know people who when they experience new
00:31:03 people they have colors maybe they have tastes and so on every time they see writing it has it has colors some people whenever
00:31:11 they hear music it's got a it's got a certain really rich color pattern and you know for some synesthetes it's
00:31:18 absolutely central I think if they lost it they'd be devastated again for me it was a very very mild form of synesthesia
00:31:25 it's like yeah it's like those interesting experiences yeah you know you might get under different altered
00:31:33 states of consciousness and and so on it's kind of cool but you know not necessarily the single most important
00:31:41 experiences in your life so let's try to go to the very simplest question the events are bring you time but perhaps
00:31:47 the simplest things can help us reveal even in time some some new ideas so what in your view is consciousness what is
00:31:58 qualia what is the hard problem of consciousness consciousness I mean the word has used many ways but the kind of
00:32:06 consciousness that I'm interested in is basically subjective experience what it feels like from the inside to be a human
00:32:16 being or any other conscious being I mean there's something it's like to be me right now I have visual images that I
00:32:24 am experiencing I'm hearing my voice I've got maybe some emotional tone I've got a stream of thoughts running through
00:32:32 my head these are all things that I experience from the first-person point of view of sometimes called this the
00:32:39 inner movie in the mind it's not a perfect it's not a perfect metaphor it's not like a movie in every ways and in
00:32:46 every way and it's very rich but yeah it's just direct subjective experience and I call that consciousness or
00:32:53 sometimes philosophers use the word qualia which you suggested people tend to use the word qualia for things like
00:32:59 the qualities of things like colors redness the experience of redness versus the experience of greenness the
00:33:07 experience of one taste or one smell versus another the experience of the quality of pain and a lot of
00:33:13 consciousness is the experience of those of those those qualities of consciousness is big
00:33:20 the entirety of any kinds of extraneous of thinking is not obviously qualia it's not like specific qualities like redness
00:33:27 or greenness but still I'm thinking about my hometown I'm thinking about what I'm gonna do later on maybe there's
00:33:33 still something running through my my head which is subjective experience maybe it goes beyond those qualities or
00:33:41 qualia philosophers sometimes use the word phenomenal consciousness for consciousness in this sense I mean
00:33:46 people also talk about access consciousness being able to access information and your mind
00:33:52 reflective consciousness being able to think about yourself but it looks like the really mysterious one the one that
00:33:58 really gets people going is phenomenal consciousness the fact that all this the fact that the subjective experience and
00:34:05 all this feels like something at all and then the hard problem is how is it that why is it that there is phenomenal
00:34:12 consciousness at all and how is it that physical processes in a brain could give you subjective experience it looks like
00:34:22 try on the face of it you have all this big complicated physical system in a brain running and without a given
00:34:28 subjective experience at all and yet we do have subjective experience so the hard problem is just explained that
00:34:36 explain how that comes about we haven't been able to build machines work a red light goes on that says it's not
00:34:44 conscious so how does how do we actually create that or how do humans do it and how do we ourselves do it we do every
00:34:51 now and then create machines that can do this you know we create babies yes that our that our conscious take out these
00:34:57 brains asbestos brain does produce consciousness but even me even though we can't create it we still don't
00:35:03 understand when it happens maybe eventually we'll be able to create machines which as a matter of fact AI
00:35:08 machines which as a matter of fact our conscious but that won't necessarily make the hard problem go away any more
00:35:15 than it does with babies because we still want to know how and why is it that these processes give you
00:35:20 consciousness you know you just made me realize for a second maybe it's a totally dumb realization but
00:35:30 nevertheless that it's a useful way to think about the creation consciousness is looking at
00:35:37 a baby so that there's a certain point at which that baby is not conscious mm-hmm something sort of the baby starts
00:35:47 from maybe I don't I don't know from a few cells right there's a certain point at which it becomes consciousness
00:35:55 arrives it's conscious of course we can't know exactly that line but that's a useful idea that we do we do create
00:36:03 consciousness again a really dumb thing for me to say but it not until now that I realized we do engineer consciousness
00:36:12 we we get to watch the process happen we don't know which point it happens or where it is but you know we do see the
00:36:19 birth of consciousness yeah I mean there's a question of course is whether babies are conscious when they're born
00:36:26 and it used to be it seems at least some people thought they weren't which is why they didn't give anesthetics to newborn
00:36:33 babies when they circumcised them and so now people think oh that's you know be incredibly cruel yeah of course of
00:36:38 course babies feel pain and now the dominant view is that the babies can feel pain I actually my partner of
00:36:45 Claudia works on this whole issue of whether there's consciousness and babies and of what kind and she certainly
00:36:53 thinks that newborn babies you know come into the world with some degree of consciousness because then you could
00:36:57 just extend the question backwards to fetuses suddenly are too politically controversial exactly territory but you
00:37:05 know there the question also arises in the animal kingdom you know what where does consciousness start or stop is
00:37:12 there a line in the animal kingdom where you know the first conscious organisms aren't it's interesting over time people
00:37:18 are becoming more and more liberal about ascribing consciousness to animals people used to think maybe only mammals
00:37:25 could be conscious now most people seem to think show a fish are conscious they can feel pain and now we're arguing over
00:37:32 insects you'll find people out there who say plants have some degree of consciousness so you know who knows
00:37:38 where it's gonna end the far end of this chain is the view that every physical system has some degree of consciousness
00:37:45 philosophers call that pen sarcasm you know I take that view I mean that's a fascinating way to view reality so you
00:37:53 could talk about if you can linger on pan psychism for a little bit what what does it mean it's not just plants are
00:38:02 conscious I mean it's that consciousness is a fundament the fabric of reality what does that mean to you how do we
00:38:09 supposed to think about that well we're used to the idea that some things in the world are fundamental
00:38:16 right in physics like why we take things like space or time or space-time mass charge as fundamental properties of the
00:38:23 universe you don't reduce them to something simpler you take those for granted you've got some laws that
00:38:31 connect them here is how mass in space and time evolved theories like relativity or quantum mechanics or some
00:38:39 future theory that will unify them both but everyone says you got to take some things as fundamental and if you can't
00:38:45 explain one thing in terms of the previous fundamental things you have to expand maybe something like this happen
00:38:53 with Maxwell ended up with fundamental principles of electromagnetism and took charge as fundamental because turned out
00:39:00 that was the best way to explain it so I at least take seriously the possibility something like that could happen with
00:39:07 consciousness take it as a fundamental property like space time and mass instead of trying to explain
00:39:15 consciousness wholly in terms of the evolution of space-time and and mass and so on take it as a primitive and then
00:39:23 connected to everything else by some fundamental laws because I mean there's basic there's this basic problem that
00:39:29 the physics we have now looks great for solving the easy problems of consciousness which are all about
00:39:35 behavior strike they give us a complicated structure and dynamics they tell us how things are going to behave
00:39:42 what kind of observable behavior they're produced which is great for the problems of explaining how we walk and how we
00:39:49 talk and so on those are the easy problems of consciousness but the hard problem was this problem about
00:39:55 subjective experience just doesn't look like that kind of problem about structure or dynamics how things behave
00:39:59 so it's hard to see existing physics is going to give you a full explanation of that certainly
00:40:07 trying to get a physics view of consciousness yes there there has to be a connecting point and it could be at
00:40:12 the very exome attic at the very beginning level but first of all there's a crazy idea that sort of everything has
00:40:26 properties of consciousness there's a would at that point the word consciousness is already beyond the
00:40:33 region of our current understanding like far because it's so far from at least for me maybe you can correct me it's far
00:40:41 from the experience and the experiences that we have that I have as a human being it to say that everything is
00:40:50 cautious that means that means there that basically another way to put that if if that's true then we understand
00:40:58 almost nothing about that ask fundamental aspect of the world how do you feel about saying an ant is
00:41:03 conscious to get the same reaction to the head or is that something you can understand I can understand ant I can't
00:41:12 understand an atom applying chol plant so I'm comfortable with living things on earth mm-hmm being cautious because
00:41:22 there's some kind of agency where there's similar size to me and they can be born and they can die and that is
00:41:35 understandable intuitively of course you anthropomorphize you put yourself in the place of the plant but I can understand
00:41:45 it I mean I'm I'm not like I don't believe actually that plants are conscious of that plant suffer but I can
00:41:52 understand that kind of belief that kind of idea how do you feel how do you feel about robots like the kind of robots we
00:41:57 have now if I told you like that you know a Roomba at some degree of consciousness or some you know deep
00:42:07 neural network I could understand that a Roomba has coasters I just had spent all day at iRobot
00:42:15 I and I mean I personally love robots and have a deep connection with robots so I can I also probably enterpreneur
00:42:20 Faiz them there's something about the physical object so this difference than a neural network then you'll network
00:42:29 running a software to me the physical object something about the human experience allows me to really see that
00:42:37 physical object is an entity and if it moves and moves in a way that it there's a like I didn't program it where it
00:42:48 feels that it's acting based on its own perception and yes self awareness and consciousness even if it's a Roomba then
00:42:58 you start to assign it some agency some consciousness so but to say that Pan psychism that conscious is a fundamental
00:43:09 property of reality is a much bigger statement mm-hmm that it it's like Turtles all the way - yeah every is it
00:43:17 doesn't end and the whole thing is so like how I know it's full mystery but if you can linger on it and I go how would
00:43:27 it how do you think about reality if consciousness is a fundamental part of its fabric the way you get there some
00:43:34 thinking can we explain consciousness given the existing fundamentals and then if you current is at least right now it
00:43:41 looks like then you've got to add something it doesn't follow that you have to add consciousness here's another
00:43:47 interesting possibility is we'll add something else that's called a proto consciousness or x-ray and then it turns
00:43:56 out space-time mass plus X will somehow collectively give you the possibility for for consciousness we don't rule out
00:44:03 that view either I call that pan proto psychism because maybe there's a some other property proto consciousness at
00:44:09 the bottom level and if you can't imagine there's actually genuine consciousness at the bottom level I
00:44:13 think we should be open to the idea there's this other thing X maybe we can't imagine this somehow gives you
00:44:20 consciousness but if we are not playing along with the idea that there really is genuine consciousness at the
00:44:26 level of course this is gonna be way out and speculative but you know at least in say if it was classical physics then
00:44:33 we'd have to end up saying well every little half every with you a bunch of particles in space-time each of these
00:44:41 particles has some kind of consciousness whose structure mirrors maybe their physical properties like its mass charge
00:44:49 its velocity and so on the structure of its consciousness would roughly correspond to that and the physical
00:44:55 interactions between particles I mean there's this old worried about physics I mentioned this before in this issue
00:45:01 about the manifest image we don't really find out about the intrinsic nature of things physics tells us about how a
00:45:08 particle relates to other particles and interacts it doesn't tell us about what the particle is in itself that was can't
00:45:18 sing in itself so here's a view the nature in itself of a particle is something mental a particle is actually
00:45:24 a conscious a little conscious subject with with properties of its consciousness to correspond to its
00:45:29 physical properties the laws of physics are actually ultimately relating these properties of conscious subjects on this
00:45:37 view a Newtonian world actually would be a vast collection of little conscious subjects at the bottom level way way
00:45:45 simpler than we are without free will or rationality or anything like that but that's what the universe would be like
00:45:50 of course that's a vastly speculative you know what no particular reason think is correct furthermore non Newtonian
00:45:57 physics say a quantum mechanical wave function suddenly a sort of difference on a vast collection of conscious subjects may be
00:46:04 the is ultimately one big wave function for the whole universe corresponding to that might be something more like as a
00:46:13 single conscious mind whose structure corresponds to the structure of the wave function people sometimes call this
00:46:19 cosmos sarcasm and now of course we're in the realm of extremely speculative philosophy there's no direct evidence
00:46:26 for this but yeah but if you want a picture of what that universe would be like think yeah giant cosmic mind with
00:46:33 enough richness and structure among it to replicate all the structure of physics I think there
00:46:40 I am at the level of particles and with quantum mechanics at the level of the wavefunction it's a it's kind of an
00:46:49 exciting beautiful possibility of course way out of reach of physics currently it is interesting that some neuroscientists
00:46:57 our act begins to take pen psychism seriously you find consciousness even in very in very simple systems so for
00:47:04 example the integrated information theory of consciousness a lot of neuroscientists are taking seriously
00:47:09 actually I just got this new book by Christophe cook just came in the feeling of life itself my consciousness is
00:47:17 widespread but can't be computed he likes he basically endorses a pen Sarkis view where you get consciousness with
00:47:24 the degree of information processing or integrated information processing in a simple in a system and even very very
00:47:30 simple systems like a couple of particles will have some degree of this so he ends up with some degree of
00:47:36 consciousness in all matter and the claim is that this theory can actually explain a bunch of stuff about the
00:47:42 connection between the brain and consciousness now that's very controversial I think it's very very
00:47:47 early days in the science of consciousness it's interesting the it's not just philosophy that might lead you
00:47:53 in this direction but there are ways of thinking quasi scientifically that leads you there too
00:48:00 but maybe different than pen psychism what do you think so Allen Watts has this quote I'd like to ask you about the
00:48:10 quote is through our eyes the universe is perceiving itself through our ears universe is listening to its harmonies
00:48:17 we are the witnesses to which the universe becomes conscious of his glory of its magnificence so that's not pants
00:48:26 psychism do you think that we are essentially the tools the senses the universe created to be conscious of
00:48:37 itself it's an interesting idea of course if you went for the giant cosmic mind view then the universe was
00:48:43 conscious all along it didn't need us we're just little components of the universal consciousness likewise if you
00:48:50 believe in penstock ism then there was some little degree of consciousness at the bottom level all
00:48:56 along and we were just more complex form of consciousness so I think maybe the quote you mentioned works better if
00:49:03 you're not a pen Sarkis you're not a Cosmo Sarkis do you think consciousness just exists at this at this intermediate
00:49:11 level and of course that's the Orthodox view that you would say is the the common useless is your own view with pan
00:49:20 psychism a rarer view I think it's generally regarded certainly as a speculative view held by a fairly small
00:49:27 minority of at least theorists philosophers most philosophers and most scientists who think about consciousness
00:49:35 are not pants artists there's been a bit of a movement in that direction the last 10 years or so it seems to be quite
00:49:40 popular especially among the younger generation but it's still very definitely a minority view many people
00:49:47 think is totally batshit crazy to use the technical term the philosophical ter so the Orthodox view I think is still
00:49:54 consciousness is something that humans have and some good number of non-human animals have and maybe a eyes might have
00:50:03 one day but it's restricted on that view then there was no consciousness at the start of universe there may be none at
00:50:08 the end but it is this thing which happened at some point in the history of the universe consciousness developed and
00:50:16 yes it's on that's a very amazing event on this view because many people are inclined to think consciousness is what
00:50:22 somehow gives meaning to our lives without consciousness there'd be no meaning no true value no
00:50:30 good versus bad and so on so with the advent of consciousness suddenly the universe went from meaningless to
00:50:39 somehow meaningful why did this happen I guess the quote you mentioned was somehow this was somehow destined to
00:50:46 happen because the universe needed to have consciousness within it to have value and have meaning and maybe you
00:50:52 could combine that with a theistic view or a teleological view the universe was inexorably evolving towards
00:50:59 consciousness actually my colleague here at NYU Tom Nagel wrote a book called mind and cosmos a few years ago where we are
00:51:06 for this teleological view of evolution toward consciousness saying this let the problems for Darwinism it's got a
00:51:14 mountain you know so it's very very controversial most people didn't agree I don't myself agree with this
00:51:21 teleological view but it is a it's at least a beautiful speculative view love the of the cosmos what do you think
00:51:31 people experience what do they seek when they believe in God from this kind of perspective mm-hmm I'm not an expert on
00:51:41 thinking about God and religion I'm not myself religious at all when people sort of pray communicate with God word at
00:51:49 which whatever form I'm not speaking to sort of the practices and the rituals non religion I mean the actual
00:51:57 experience of that people really have a deep connection of God in some cases mhm what do you think that experience is
00:52:08 it's so common at least throughout the history of civilization that it seems like we seek that at the very least it's
00:52:19 an interesting conscious experience that people have when they experience religious or or prayer and so on
00:52:27 neuroscientists have tried to examine what bits of the brain are active and so on but yeah that is this deeper question
00:52:34 of what is what are people looking for when they're doing this and like I said but no real expertise on this but it
00:52:41 does seem the one thing people are after is a sense of meaning and value a sense of connection to something greater than
00:52:49 themselves that will give their lives meaning and value and maybe the thought is if there is a God and God somehow is
00:52:56 a universal consciousness who has invested this universe with meaning and some our connection to God might give
00:53:08 your life meaning I got so I can kind of see the see the attractions of that but it still makes me wonder why is it
00:53:14 exactly that a universal consciousness you know God would be needed to give the lot to give the world
00:53:20 if I mean if universal consciousness can give the world meaning why can't local consciousness give the
00:53:25 world meaning to so I think my consciousness gives my world is the meaning is the origin of meaning vary
00:53:32 your world yeah I experience things as good or bad happy sad interesting important so my consciousness invests
00:53:40 this world with meaning without any consciousness maybe it would be a bleak meaningless universe but I don't see why
00:53:47 I need someone else's consciousness or even God's consciousness to give this this universe meaning here we are local
00:53:54 creatures with our own subjective experiences I think we can give the universe meaning ourselves so I mean
00:54:00 maybe just some people that feels inadequate yeah our own local consciousness is somehow
00:54:06 too puny and insignificant to invest any of this with cosmic significance and maybe God gives you a sense of cosmic
00:54:14 significance but I'm just speculating here so the you know it's a really interesting idea that consciousness is
00:54:24 the thing that makes life meaningful if you could maybe just just briefly explore that for a second so I suspect
00:54:34 just from listening to you know you mean in an almost trivial sense just the day-to-day experiences of life have
00:54:45 because of you attached identity to it mm-hmm they become oh I guess I want to ask something I I would always wanted to ask
00:55:00 College it Rock world renowned philosopher what is the meaning of life but I suspect you don't mean
00:55:09 consciousness gives any kind of greater meaning to it all yeah and more to day-to-day but is there greater meaning
00:55:18 to it all I think life has meaning for us because we are conscious so without consciousness no meaning
00:55:26 consciousness invests our life with meaning so consciousness is the source of my view of the meaning of life but I
00:55:32 wouldn't say consciousness self is the meaning of life I'd say what's meaningful in life is basically
00:55:40 what we find meaningful what we experience as meaningful so if you find meaning and fulfillment and value and
00:55:48 say intellectual work like understanding then that's your that's a very significant part of the meaning of life
00:55:54 for you if you find it in social connections or in raising a family and that's the meaning of life for you the
00:56:01 meaning kind of comes from what you value as a conscious creature so I think there's no you on this view there's no
00:56:07 universal solution you know Universal answer to the question what is the meaning of life the
00:56:13 meaning of life is where you find it as a conscious creature but it's consciousness that somehow makes value
00:56:19 possible experiencing some things as good or as bad or as meaningful something comes from within
00:56:26 consciousness so you think consciousness is a crucial component ingredient of having given assigning value to things I
00:56:35 mean it's kind of a fairly strong intuition that without consciousness there wouldn't really be any value if we
00:56:42 just had a purely a universe of unconscious creatures would anything be better or worse than anything else
00:56:49 certainly when it comes to ethical dilemmas you know you know about the older the old trolley problem do you you
00:56:56 kill one person or do you switch to the other track to kill kill Fievel I got a variant on this their zombie trolley
00:57:04 problem where there's one conscious being on on one track and five humanoid zombies let's make them robots yeah who
00:57:13 are not who are not conscious on the on the other track do you given that choice you kill the one conscious being or the
00:57:21 five unconscious robots most people have a fairly clear intuition here yeah kill the kill the unconscious beings because
00:57:27 they basically they don't have a meaningful life they're not really persons conscious beings of course we
00:57:38 don't have good intuition about something like an unconscious being so in philosophical terms you refer to as Azzam
00:57:50 mm-hmm it's a useful thought experiment construction in philosophical terms but we don't yet have them so that's kind of
00:57:58 what we may be able to create with robots and I don't necessarily know what that even means
00:58:07 yes merely hypothetical for now they're just a thought experiment they may never be possible I mean the extreme case of a
00:58:15 zombie is a being which is physically functionally behaviorally identical to me but not conscious that's a mirror I
00:58:22 don't think that could ever be built in this universe the question is just could we does that hypothetically make sense
00:58:28 that's kind of a useful contrast class to raise questions like why aren't we zombies how does it come about that
00:58:34 we're conscious and we're not like that but there were less extreme versions of this like robots which are maybe not
00:58:41 physically identical to us maybe not even functionally identical to us maybe they've got a different architecture but
00:58:47 they can do a lot of sophisticated things maybe carry on a conversation but they're not conscious that's not so far
00:58:54 out we've got simple computer systems these tending in that direction now and presumably this is gonna get more and
00:59:02 more sophisticated over years to come where we may have some pretty it's least quite straightforward to conceive of
00:59:10 some pretty sophisticated robot systems that can use language and be fairly high functioning without consciousness at all
00:59:18 then I stipulate that I mean we've cost there's this tricky question of how you would know whether they're conscious but
00:59:24 let's say we've somehow solved that and we know that these high-functioning robots aren't conscious then the
00:59:29 question is do they have moral status does it matter how we treat them like what is moral status means does
00:59:37 basically society can they suffer doesn't matter how we treat them I would for example if we if I mistreat this
00:59:47 glass this cup by  by shattering it then that's bad well why is it bad that was kind of make a mess it's gonna be
00:59:54 annoying for me in my partner and so it's not bad for the cup no one would say the cup itself has moral state
01:00:03 hey you you heard the cup and that's that's doing it a moral harm likewise plants will again if they're
01:00:10 not conscious most people think if by operating a plant you're not harming it but if a being is conscious on the other
01:00:17 hand then you are harming it so Siri or I dare not say the name of Alexa anyway we're so we don't think we're we're
01:00:29 morally harming Alexa by turning her off or disconnecting her or even destroying her whether it's the system or the or
01:00:36 the underlying software system because we don't really think she's conscious on the other hand you moved to it like the
01:00:43 the disembodied being in the moving in the movie her Samantha I guess she was kind of presented as conscious and then
01:00:49 if you if you destroyed her you'd certainly be committing a serious harm so I think how strong senses if a being
01:00:56 is conscious and can undergo subjective experiences that are matters morally how we treat them so if a robot is conscious
01:01:03 it matters but if a robot is not conscious then they basically just meet or a machine and it and it and it
01:01:11 doesn't matter so I think at least maybe how we think about this stuff is fundamentally wrong but I think a lot of
01:01:16 people to think about this stuff seriously including people to think about say the moral treatment of animals
01:01:21 and so on come to the view that consciousness is ultimately kind of the line between systems that where we have
01:01:29 to take them into account in thinking morally about how we act and systems for which we don't and I think I've seen you
01:01:38 the writer talked about the demonstration of consciousness from a system like that from a system like Alex
01:01:49 or a conversational agent that is what you would be looking for it's kind of at the very basic level for the system to
01:01:58 have an awareness that I'm just a program and yet why do I experience this or not to have that experience but to
01:02:08 communicate that to you so that's what us humans would sound like if you all of a sudden woke up one day
01:02:15 like Kafka right in the body of a bug or something but in a computer you all sudden realize you don't have a body and
01:02:22 yet you would feel what you're feeling you would probably say those kinds of things mm-hmm
01:02:27 so do you think a system essentially becomes conscious by convincing us that it's conscious hmm
01:02:35 through the words that I just mentioned so by being confused about the fact that why am I having these experiences well
01:02:46 so basically I don't think this is what makes your conscious but I do think being puzzled about consciousness is a
01:02:52 very good sign that a system is conscious so if I encountered a robot that actually seemed to be genuinely
01:03:00 puzzled by its own mental states and saying yeah I have all these weird experiences and I don't see how to
01:03:07 explain them I know I'm a just a set of silicon circuits but I don't see how that would give you my consciousness I
01:03:12 would at least take that as some evidence that there's some consciousness going on there I don't think a system
01:03:20 needs to be puzzled about consciousness to be conscious many people are puzzled by their consciousness animals don't
01:03:26 seem to be puzzled at all I still think they're conscious but I think that's a requirement on consciousness but I do
01:03:33 think if we're looking for signs for consciousness say in AI systems one of the things will help convince me that an
01:03:41 AI system is consciousness if it shows signs of it if it shows signs of introspectively recognizing something
01:03:49 like consciousness and finding this philosophically puzzling and the way that the way that that we do the
01:03:55 incision interesting thought though because a lot of people sort of would at the shower level criticize the Turing
01:04:03 test for language that it's essentially what I heard like Dan Dennett criticized it in this kind of way which is it's
01:04:12 really puts a lot of emphasis on lying yeah and being able to being able to imitate human beings yeah there's this a
01:04:21 there's this cartoon of the AI system studying for the Turing test it's gotta be this book called talk like a human
01:04:28 like man I don't have to waste my time learning how to imitate humans maybe the AI system is gonna be way
01:04:33 beyond the hard problem of consciousness and it's gotta be this thing why do I need to waste my time pretending that I
01:04:37 recognize the hard problem of consciousness - in order for people to recognize me as conscious yeah it just
01:04:45 feels like I guess the question is do you think there's a we can never really create a test for consciousness because
01:04:53 it feels like we're very human centric and so the only way we would be convinced that something is
01:05:01 consciousness but is basically the thing demonstrates the illusion of consciousness that we can never really
01:05:10 know whether it's conscious or not and in fact that almost feels like it doesn't matter them or does it still
01:05:17 matter to you that something is conscious or it demonstrates consciousness you still see that
01:05:23 fundamental distinction I think a lot of people whether our system is conscious or not matters hugely for many things
01:05:31 like how we treat it cannot suffer and so on but still that leaves open the question how can we ever know and it's
01:05:38 true that it's awfully hard to see how we can know for sure whether a system is conscious I suspect
01:05:45 that sociologically the thing that's going to convince us that the system is conscious is in part things like social
01:05:54 interaction conversation and so on where they seem to be conscious they talk about their conscious state so I just
01:05:59 talked about being happy or sad or finding things meaningful or being in pain that will tend to convince us if we
01:06:07 don't the system genuinely seems to be conscious we don't treat it as such eventually it's gonna seem like a
01:06:13 strange form of racism or speciesism or somehow not to acknowledge them and actually we believe that by the way I
01:06:20 believe that there is going to be something akin to the civil rights movement but for robots mm-hmm
01:06:29 I think the moment you have a Roomba say please don't kick me that hurts just say it yeah I think they will fundamentally
01:06:38 change the fabric of our society I think you're probably right although it's gonna be very tricky
01:06:44 because just say where we've got the technology where these conscious beings can just be moderated and multiplied by
01:06:52 the thousands by flicking a switch so and the legal status is gonna be different but ultimately the moral
01:06:59 status ought to be the same and yeah the civil rights issue is gonna be a huge mess so if one day somebody clones you
01:07:12 another very real possibility in fact I find the conversation between two copies of David Chalmers quite interesting
01:07:25 every thought he's not making any sense so what do you think he would be cautious I do think he would be
01:07:35 conscious I do think in some sense not sure would be me there would be two different beings at this point I think
01:07:41 they both be conscious and they both have many of the same mental properties I think they both you know way have the
01:07:50 same moral status it'll be wrong to hurt either of them or they kill them and so on still there's some sense in which
01:07:57 probably their legal status would have to be different if I am the original and that one's just a clone then you're
01:08:03 creating a clone of me presumably the clone doesn't for example automatically own the stuff that I own or you know
01:08:14 I've got a you know certain connect the things that the people I interact with my family my partner and so on and I'm
01:08:21 gonna somehow be connected to them in a way in which the clone isn't so because you came slightly first yeah but this
01:08:32 alone would argue yeah they have really as much of a connection they have all the memories of that connection then
01:08:37 away you might say it's kind of unfair to discriminate against them but say you've got an apartment that only one
01:08:42 person can live in or a partner who only one person or why she didn't leave you that's the original it's an interesting
01:08:49 philosophical question but you might say because I actually have this history if I am the same person there's a one
01:08:57 that came before and the clone is not that I have this history that the clone doesn't because there's also the
01:09:05 question isn't the clone the same person - this is the question about personal identity if I continue and I create a
01:09:11 clone over there I want to say this one is me and this one is is someone else but you could take the view that a clone
01:09:18 is equally me of course in a movie like Star Trek where they have a teletransport it basically creates
01:09:23 clones all the time they treat the clones as if they're the original person of course they destroy the original body
01:09:30 in Star Trek Isis there's only one left around and only very occasionally two things go wrong and you get two copies
01:09:36 of Captain Kirk it's somehow our legal system at the very least is gonna have to sort out some of these issues and
01:09:42 that maybe that's what's moral and watch League what's legally acceptable are gonna come apart what question would you
01:09:52 ask a clone of yourself yeah is there something useful II you can find out from him about the fundamentals of
01:10:03 cautiousness even I mean kind of in principle I know that if it's a perfect clone it's gonna behave just like me so
01:10:11 I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to I could discover whether it's a perfect clone by seeing whether it answers like
01:10:17 me but otherwise I know what I'm gonna find is being which is just like me except that it's just undergone this
01:10:23 great shock of discovering that it's a clone so just so you woke me up tomorrow and said hey Dave sorry to tell you this
01:10:32 but you're actually the clone and you provided be really convincing evidence should be the film of my being cloned
01:10:40 and then all wrapped here being here and and waking up so you proved to me I'm a criminal yeah okay I would find that
01:10:46 shocking and who knows how I would react to this so so maybe by talking to the clone I'd find something about my own
01:10:52 psychology but I can't find out so easily like how I'd react upon discovering that I'm a clone I could
01:10:56 certainly ask the clone if it's conscious and what his consciousness is like and so on but I guess I kind of
01:11:03 know if it's a perfect clone it's gonna behave roughly like me of course at the beginning there'll be a
01:11:07 question about whether a perfect clone is possible so I may want to ask it lots of questions to see if it's
01:11:13 consciousness and the way it talks about is consciousness and the way it reacts to things in general is like me and you
01:11:22 know that will occupy us for a it's a basic unit unit testing in the early model yeah so you so if it's a perfect
01:11:29 clone you say there's gonna be --have exactly like you so that takes us to freewill mmm-hmm is there a free will
01:11:39 are we able to make decisions that are not predetermined from the initial conditions in the universe you know
01:11:46 philosophers do this annoying thing of saying it depends what you mean so in this case yeah really depends on what
01:11:54 you mean by by freewill if you mean something which was not determined in advance could never have
01:12:01 been determined then I don't know we have freewill I mean there's quantum mechanics and
01:12:05 who's to say if that opens up some room but I'm not sure we have freewill in that sense I'm also not sure that's the
01:12:13 kind of freewill that really matters you know what matters to us is being able to do what we want and to create our own
01:12:20 futures we've got this distinction between having our lives be under our control and under someone else's control
01:12:28 method we've got the sense of actions that we are responsible for versus ones that were not I think you can make those
01:12:34 distinctions even in a deterministic universe and this is what people call the compatibilist view of freewill where
01:12:41 it's compatible with determinism I think for many purposes the kind of freewill that matters is something we can have in
01:12:48 a deterministic universe and I can't see any reason in principle why an AI system couldn't have freewill
01:12:55 of that kind if you mean super-duper freewill the ability to violate the laws of physics and doing things that
01:13:01 imprints of all could not be predicted I don't know maybe no one has that kind of freewill what's the connection between
01:13:10 the the reality of freewill and the experience of it the subjective experience in your view so how does
01:13:18 consciousness connect to this to the experience to the reality in the experience of feels certainly true that when we make
01:13:26 decisions and when we choose and so on we feel like we have an open future yes feel like I could do this I could go
01:13:33 into philosophy or I could go into math I could go to a movie tonight I could go to restaurant so we experience these
01:13:42 things as if the future is open and maybe we experience ourselves as exerting a kind of effect on the future
01:13:51 that somehow picking out one path from many paths were previously open and you might think that actually if we're in a
01:13:58 deterministic universe there's a sense in which objectively those paths weren't really open all along but subjectively
01:14:06 they were open and that's I think that's what really matters in making a decisions were our experience of making
01:14:13 a decision as choosing a path for for ourselves I mean in general our introspective models of the mind I think
01:14:19 are generally very distorted representations of the mind so it may well be that our experience of our self
01:14:26 in making a decision experience of what's going on doesn't terribly well mirror what's  what's going on I mean
01:14:32 you know maybe there are antecedents in the brain way before anything came into consciousness and and and so on
01:14:40 those aren't represented in our introspective models so in general our experience of our experience of
01:14:49 perception yes I experienced perceptual image of the external world it's not a terribly good model of what's actually
01:14:55 going on in the in my visual cortex and so on which has all these layers and so on it's just one little snapshot of of
01:15:01 one bit of that so in general yeah introspective models are very over oversimplified and it wouldn't be
01:15:08 surprising if that was true of free will as well this also incidentally can be applied to
01:15:13 consciousness itself there is this very interesting view that consciousness itself is an introspective illusion in
01:15:21 fact we're not conscious but we but weeks the brain just has these introspective models of itself or
01:15:26 oversimplifies everything and represents itself as having these special properties of consciousness thing it's a
01:15:32 really simple way to kind of keep track of it so and so on and then on The Illusionist
01:15:38 view yeah that's just a that's just an illusion it was I find this view I find it implausible I do find it very
01:15:45 attractive in some ways because it's easy to tell some story about how the brain would create introspective models
01:15:52 of its own consciousness of its own free will as a way of simplifying yourself I mean it's similar way when we perceive
01:15:59 the external world we perceive it as having these colors that maybe it doesn't really have because that's a
01:16:05 really useful way of keeping tracks of keeping track did you say that you find it not very plausible because I I
01:16:12 thought I find it both plausible and attractive in some sense because it I mean that's that kind of view is one
01:16:23 that has the minimum amount of mystery around it you can kind of understand that kind of
01:16:31 view everything else says we don't understand so much of this picture you know it is four it is very attractive I
01:16:37 recently wrote an article all about this kind of issue called the meta problem of consciousness the hard problem is how
01:16:43 does the brain give you consciousness the meta problem is why are we puzzled by the hard problem of consciousness and
01:16:50 because you know I'll being puzzled by it that's ultimately a bit of behavior we might be able to explain that bit of
01:16:56 behavior as one of the easy problems consciousness so maybe there'll be some computational model that explains why
01:17:03 we're puzzled by consciousness the meta problem has come up with that model and I've been thinking about that a lot
01:17:08 lately there's some interesting stories you can tell about why the right kind of computational system might develop these
01:17:17 introspective models of itself that are attributed itself these special properties so that that meta problem is
01:17:24 a resource fasten gram program for everyone and then if you've got attraction to sort of simple views
01:17:31 desert landscapes and so on then you can go all the way with what people call illusionism and say in fact
01:17:37 consciousness itself is not real what Israel is just these these these introspective models we have that tell
01:17:46 us that we're conscious so the view is very simple very attractive very powerful the trouble is of course it has
01:17:54 to say that deep down consciousness is not real we're not actually experiencing right now and it looks like it's just
01:18:01 contradicting a fundamental datum of our existence and this is why most people find this view crazy just as they find
01:18:08 Pam sake as I'm crazy in one way people find illusionism crazy in another way but it's I mean but it so yes it has to
01:18:20 deny this fundamental datum of our existence now and the view that makes the view soar frankly unbelievable for
01:18:27 most people on the other hand the view develop right might be able to explain why we find it unbelievable
01:18:33 because these modal's are so deeply hop right into our head and they're all integrated so it's not you can't escape
01:18:39 that the the illusion and as the crazy possibility is it possible that the entirety of the universe our planet all
01:18:47 the people in New York all the organisms on our planet the including me here today are not real in in that sense
01:18:56 they're all part of an illusion inside of Dave Chalmers whose head I think all this could be a simulation no but not
01:19:05 just a simulation yeah because the simulation kind of is outside of you I mean what if it's all an illusion they
01:19:14 yes a dream that you are experiencing that's it's all in your mind right thank you is that can you take
01:19:24 illusionism that far well there's illusionism about the external world and illusionism about consciousness and
01:19:30 these might go in respective different illusionism about the external world kind of takes you back to Descartes and
01:19:36 yet could all this be produced by an evil demon they caught himself also had the dream argument he said how do you
01:19:42 know you're not dreaming right now how do you know this is not an amazing dream and it's at least a possibility that
01:19:47 yeah this could be some super duper complex dream in the next universe up I guess so my attitude is that just as
01:19:57 when a car thought that if the evil demon was doing it it's not real a lot of people these
01:20:03 days say if a simulation is doing it it's not real as I was saying before I think even if it's a simulation that
01:20:09 doesn't stop this is being real it just tells us what the world is made of black white if it's a dream it could turn out
01:20:16 that all this is like my dream created by my brain and the next universe up my own view is that wouldn't stop this
01:20:22 physical world from being real would turn out this Cup at the most fundamental level was made of a bit of
01:20:29 say my consciousness in the Dreaming mind at the next level up maybe that would give you a kind of weird kind of
01:20:36 pants sarcasm about reality but it wouldn't show that the cup isn't real but just tell us it's ultimately made of
01:20:43 processes in my dreaming mind so I'd resist the idea that if the physical world is a dream then it's an illusion
01:20:54 then it's right by the way perhaps you have an interesting thought about it why is there cards demon or genius
01:21:02 considered evil what couldn't have been a benevolent one I had the same powers yeah I mean Dakota the Malheur genie the
01:21:13 evil genie or evil genius malign I guess was the word but it's interesting question I mean a later philosophy
01:21:23 Berkeley said no in fact all this is done by God God actually supply supplies you all of these all of these
01:21:31 perceptions and ideas and that's how physical reality is sustained interestingly Barclays God is doing
01:21:38 something that doesn't look so different from what des cartes evil demon was doing it's just that they can't thought
01:21:44 it was deception and Berkeley thought it was not and I'm I'm actually most sympathetic to Berkeley here yeah this
01:21:54 evil demon may be trying to deceive you but I think okay well the evil demon may just be under the working under a false
01:22:02 philosophical theory is deceiving you it's wrong it's like there's machines on the matrix they thought they were
01:22:06 deceiving you that all this stuff is real I think know if we're in a matrix it's all still it's all still real
01:22:13 yeah the the philosopher ok booster I had a nice story about this about 50 years ago about dick Hart's evil demon
01:22:21 where he said this demon spends all its time trying to fool people but fails because I'm how old demon ends up doing
01:22:30 is constructing realities for 4 people so yeah I think that maybe if it's a very natural to take this view that if
01:22:37 we're in a simulation or or evil demon scenario or something then none of this is real but I think it may be ultimately
01:22:44 a philosophical mistake especially if you take on board sort of the view of reality well what matters to reality is
01:22:50 really its structure something like its mathematical structure and so on which seems to be the view that a lot of
01:22:55 people take from contemporary physics and looks like you can find all that mathematical structure in a simulation
01:23:03 maybe even in a dream and so on so as long as that structure is real I would say that's enough for the physical world
01:23:09 to be real yeah the physical world may turn out to be somewhat more intangible than we had thought and have a
01:23:14 surprising nature of it we're already gotten very used to that from for modern science see you've kind
01:23:22 of looted that you don't have to have consciousness for high levels of intelligence but to create truly general
01:23:31 intelligent systems ági systems at human level intelligence and perhaps superhuman level intelligence you've
01:23:37 talked about that it you feel like that kind of thing might be very far away but nevertheless one we reached that point
01:23:46 do you think consciousness from an engineering perspective is needed or at least highly beneficial for creating in
01:23:55 the a GI system yeah no one knows what consciousness is for functionally so right now there's no specific thing we
01:24:02 can point to and say you need consciousness for that still my inclination is to believe that in
01:24:09 principle AGI is possible at the very least I don't see why someone couldn't simulate a brain ultimately have a
01:24:16 computational system that produces all of our behavior and if that's possible I'm sure vastly many other computational
01:24:24 systems of equal or greater fists ocation are possible for all of our cognitive functions and more my
01:24:32 inclination is to think that once you've got all these cognitive functions you know perception attention reasoning
01:24:44 introspection language emotion and so on it's very likely you'll have you'll have consciousness as well as this is very
01:24:51 hard for me to see how you'd have a system had all those things while bypassing somehow conscious so just
01:24:59 naturally it's integrated quite naturally there's a lot of overlap about the kind of function that required to
01:25:06 achieve each of those things that's so you can't disentangle them even when you're in us but we don't know what
01:25:13 caused a role of consciousness in the physical world what it does I mean just say it turns out consciousness does
01:25:18 something very specific in the physical world like collapsing wave functions as on one common interpretation of quantum
01:25:25 mechanics that all we might find someplace where it actually makes a difference and we could say  here is
01:25:30 where in collapsing wave functions it's driving the behavior of a system and maybe it could even turn out that for a
01:25:39 GI you'd need something playing that I mean if you wanted to connect this to free will some people think
01:25:43 consciousness collapsing wave functions that would be how the conscious mind exerts affect on the physical world and
01:25:51 exerts its free will and maybe it could turn out that any AGI that didn't utilize that mechanism would be limited
01:25:59 in the kinds of functionality that have had I don't myself find that plausible I think probably that functionality could
01:26:05 be simulated you could imagine once we had a very specific idea about the role of consciousness in the physical world
01:26:12 this would have some impact on the capacity of a GIS and if it was a role that could not be duplicated elsewhere
01:26:21 then we have to find we did we have to find some way to either get consciousness in the system to play that
01:26:27 role or to simulate it if we can isolate a particular role to consciousness of course that's incredibly seems like an
01:26:35 incredibly difficult thing whatever worries about X sensual threats of conscious intelligent
01:26:46 beings that are not us though so certainly I'm sure you're worried about us yeah from an existential threat
01:26:54 perspective but outside of us AI systems there's a couple of different kinds of existential threats here one is an
01:27:00 existential threat to consciousness generally I mean yes I care about humans and the survival of humans and so on but
01:27:08 just say it turns out that that eventually we're replaced by some artificial beings around humans but are
01:27:15 somehow our successes they still have good lives they still do interesting and wonderful things with the universe I
01:27:23 don't think that's that's not so bad that's just our successors we were one stage in evolution something different
01:27:30 maybe better came next if on the other hand all of consciousness was wiped out that would be a very serious moral
01:27:38 disaster one way that could happen is by all intelligent life being wiped out and many people think that yeah once you get
01:27:46 to humans and AI is an amazing sophistication where everyone has got the the ability to create weapons that
01:27:53 can destroy the whole universe just by just by pressing a button then maybe it's inevitable all intelligent life
01:28:02 will will die out that would be a that would certainly be a disaster and we've got to think very hard about how to
01:28:07 avoid that but yeah another interesting kind of disaster is that may be intelligent life is not wiped out but
01:28:15 all consciousness is wiped out so just say you thought unlike what I was saying a moment ago that there are two
01:28:20 different kinds of intelligent systems some which are conscious and some which are some which are not and just say it
01:28:29 turns out that we create AGI with with higher degree of intelligence meaning higher degree of sophistication and
01:28:34 that's behavior but with no consciousness at all that AGI could take over the world maybe but then there be
01:28:42 but let there be no consciousness in this world this would be a world of zombies some people have called this the
01:28:48 zombie apocalypse because it's consciousness consciousness is gone you've merely got this
01:28:54 / intelligent non-conscious robots and I would say that's a moral disaster in the same way in almost the same way that the
01:29:01 world with no intelligent life is a moral disaster all value and meaning may be gone from from that world so these
01:29:09 are both threats to watch out for now my own view is if you get super intelligence you're almost certainly
01:29:13 going to bring consciousness with it so I hope that's not gonna happen but of course I don't understand consciousness
01:29:20 no one understands consciousness this is one reason for this is one reason at least among many for thinking very
01:29:25 seriously about consciousness and thinking about the kind of future we want to create with a you know city in a
01:29:33 world with humans and or AI how do you feel about the possibility of consciousness so naturally does come
01:29:40 with a GI systems that we are just a step in the evolution that will be just something a blimp on the record that be
01:29:50 studied in books by the a GI systems centuries from now I mean I think I'd probably be ok with that
01:29:58 especially if somehow humans are continuous with AG eyes I mean I think something like this is inevitable the
01:30:03 very least humans are gonna be transformed we're gonna be augmented by technology that's already happening in
01:30:10 all kinds of ways we're gonna be transformed by technology where our brains are gonna be uploaded and
01:30:17 computationally enhanced and eventually that line between what's a human and what's a what's an AI maybe kind of hard
01:30:24 to hard to draw how much does it matter for example that some future being a thousand years from now that somehow
01:30:31 descended from us actually still has biology I think it would be nice if you kind of point to its cognitive system to
01:30:38 point to some past that had some roots in us and chaser trace a continuous line there that would be selfishly nice for
01:30:45 me to think that ok I'm connected to this thread line through the future of the world but if it turns out ok there's
01:30:51 a jump there they'd if they found a better way to design cognitive systems they designed a wholly new kind of thing
01:30:59 and the only line is some causal chain of designing and systems that design better systems is that so much worse I
01:31:05 don't know still at least part of a causal chain of design and yes they're not humans but
01:31:13 still they're our successes ultimately I think it's probably inevitable that something like that will happen at least
01:31:19 we were at least we were part of the process it'll be nice if they still cared enough about us to you know maybe
01:31:28 to engage with our arguments I'm really hoping that the Agis are gonna solve all the problems of philosophy they'll come
01:31:35 back and read all this all this crap for the 20th and 21st century hard problem of consciousness and here is why they
01:31:41 got it wrong and so and if that happened then I'd really feel like I was part of at least a intellectual process over
01:31:45 centuries and that would be kind of cool I'm pretty sure they would clone or they would recreate David Chalmers and for
01:31:54 the fun of it sort of bring back other philosophy a car the garden and just put them in a room he's just watch it'll be
01:32:02 a Netflix of the future show will you bring philosophers from different human 100% human philosophers from previous
01:32:08 generations put them in a room and see them I am totally I'm totally up for that simulators AG eyes of the future if
01:32:18 you're watching who that would like to be recreated and who wouldn't be cut with the car it would be the first
01:32:26 hangout as part of such a TV show with a philosopher that's no longer with us from long ago who would it who would you
01:32:34 choose dick count would have to be right up there oh actually a couple of months ago I got to have a conversation with
01:32:40 dick Hart an actor who's actually a philosopher came out on stage playing Descartes I didn't know this was gonna
01:32:45 happen and I just after I gave a talk and a bit of a surreal my ideas were crap and all drive from him and so I
01:32:53 made along with a long argument this was great no I would love to see what Descartes would think about AI for
01:32:59 example and modern neuroscience and so on I suspect not too much would surprise him but that ya William James you know
01:33:08 for psychologists of consciousness I think James was probably the was probably the the richest but oh there
01:33:17 are manual cars you know I never really understood when is up to if I got to actually talk to
01:33:23 him about some of this hey it was Princess Elizabeth who talked with Descartes and who really you know got
01:33:30 other problems of how they carts ideas of a non-physical mind interacting with the with the the physical body couldn't
01:33:38 really work she's been kind of most philosophers think she's been proved right so maybe put me in a room with
01:33:43 Descartes and Princess Elizabeth and we can all argue it out what kind of feature so we talked about was zombies a
01:33:54 concerning future but what kind of future excites you what do you think if we look forward sort of we're at the
01:34:02 very early stages of understanding consciousness and we're now at the early stages of being able to engineer complex
01:34:10 interesting systems that have degrees of intelligence maybe one day we'll have degrees of consciousness maybe be able
01:34:17 to upload brains all those possibilities virtual reality what is there a particular aspect of this future world
01:34:25 that just excites you I think there are lots of different aspects I mean frankly I want it to hurry up and half us like
01:34:31 yeah we've had some progress lately an AI and VR but in the grand scheme of things it's still kind of slow the
01:34:38 changes are not yet transformative and you know I'm in my 50s I've only got so long left I'd like I'd like to see
01:34:45 really serious AI in my lifetime and really serious virtual worlds because yeah once people are I would like to be
01:34:51 able to hang out in a virtual reality which is richer then then then this reality to really get to inhabit
01:35:01 fundamentally different kinds of spaces well I would very much like to be able to upload my mind onto a onto a computer
01:35:11 so maybe I don't have to die if this is maybe gradually replace my neurons with silicon chips and I'd have it like a few
01:35:18 selfishly that would be that would be wonderful I suspect I'm not going to quite get there in a in my lifetime but
01:35:26 once that's possible then you've got the possibility of transforming your consciousness in remarkable ways or
01:35:32 renting it enhancing it so let me ask them if such a system is a possibility within your lifetime and you
01:35:41 were given the opportunity to become immortal in this kind of way would you choose to be immortal yes I totally
01:35:53 would I know some people say they couldn't it would be awful to be a to be immortal be so boring or something I
01:36:03 don't see I really don't see a don't see why this might be I mean even if it's just ordinary life that continues
01:36:09 ordinary life is not so bad but furthermore I kind of suspect that you know if the universe is gonna go on
01:36:16 forever or indefinitely it's going to continue to be interesting it I don't think yeah your view was that we just
01:36:23 hit this one romantic point of interest now and afterwards it's all gonna be boring super-intelligent stasis I guess
01:36:30 my vision is more like no it's gonna continue to be infinitely interesting something like as you go up the set
01:36:36 theoretic hierarchy you know you go from the the finite car finite Cardinals to Aleph zero and then
01:36:45 through there to all the Aleph one and I love two and maybe the continuum and you keep taking power sets and you know in
01:36:51 set theory they've got these results that actually all this is fundamentally unpredictable it doesn't follow any
01:36:57 simple computational patterns there's new levels of creativity as the set theoretic universe expands and expands I
01:37:03 guess that's my future that's my vision of the future that's my optimistic vision of the
01:37:08 future of superintelligence it will keep expanding and keep growing but still being fundamentally unpredictable at
01:37:14 many points I mean yes this gets creates all kinds of worries like couldn't it all be fragile and be destroyed at any
01:37:20 point so we're gonna need a solution to that problem if we get to stipulate that I'm immortal well I hope that I'm not
01:37:26 just immortal and stuck in the single world forever but I'm immortal and get to take part in this process of going
01:37:33 through infinitely rich created futures rich unpredictable exciting well I think I speak for a lot of people in saying I
01:37:41 hope you do become immortal and there'll be that Netflix show the future where you get to argue with
01:37:49 Descartes perhaps for all eternity so David was an honor thank you so much for talking today thanks it was a pleasure

01:38:30 compelling view of the world but to account for consciousness we have to go beyond the resources it provides
