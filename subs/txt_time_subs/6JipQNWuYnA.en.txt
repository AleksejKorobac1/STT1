00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Alexander Friedmann he's a professor at Drexel University and the director of
00:00:10 the nihai and plasma Institute he's one of the top plasma physicists and plasma chemists in the world and most
00:00:17 importantly to me he's my dad plasma by the way is not referring to blood plasma in biology but to the
00:00:25 fourth state of matter in physics solid liquid gas and plasma which is a gas of charged particles that behaves in
00:00:34 fascinating ways plasma makes up the Sun the Stars lightning plasma displays fluorescent lamps and is the most common
00:00:42 state of matter in the universe this is the 100th episode of this podcast there were quite a few very big conversations
00:00:50 which were all options but I decided to go back to where it all started for me and to do a personal conversation with
00:00:57 my dad this was a difficult conversation for me for many reasons but life is short perhaps we needed microphones to give us
00:01:05 a chance to say the things we never would have said otherwise this is that conversation this is also a chance to
00:01:13 briefly look back if you don't know I stepped down from my full-time position at MIT to pursue a dream of building a
00:01:20 start-up around AI systems that form meaningful connections with human beings I didn't have much money the videos I've
00:01:28 made and this podcast was a way to try to pay for food and rent while taking on the startup journey it also gave me a
00:01:34 chance to have conversations with people who inspire me who make me think and to share it with an amazing community
00:01:42 frankly I don't know what to do with the idea that this thing has been listened to thirty five million times I'm pretty
00:01:49 sure most of those are AI BOTS but if you're one of the rare biological systems listening to this thank you I
00:01:56 feel the love it gives me a lot of strength in both this and the startup by the way
00:02:03 some people asked my full very Russian birth name is Alexei Alexei or Alyosha or as my mom might say
00:02:13 Yoshioka but I've always enjoyed all my friends and people close to me we'll call me Lex or Lex in English a few

00:03:30 each in a minute this is the artificial intelligence podcast I'm an AI researcher and engineer first and
00:03:36 foremost but I see AI is much bigger than anyone technical or scientific field I see it as our journey to
00:03:44 understand and engineer the mind to explore the nature of intelligence consciousness human behavior the fabric
00:03:51 of the universe that gifted us the triumphs and the tragedy of the human condition without telling us except for
00:03:57 a few hints here and there about the meaning of it all I will talk to roboticists and philosophers physicists
00:04:05 and historians mathematicians and astronauts and maybe even political leaders always returning to the
00:04:13 technical which is home for me but also not being afraid to venture out into the messy human world I honestly don't know
00:04:21 how long I'll be doing this podcast life is full of surprises but for at least a short while I hope

00:05:47 keto and carnivore diet for a very long time now that means eating very little carbs I used to love cereal obviously
00:05:55 most cereals have crazy amounts of sugar which is terrible for you so I quit years ago but magic spoon is a totally
00:06:04 new thing zero sugar 11 grams of protein and only three net grams of carbs it tastes delicious
00:06:10 and honestly way too good to be true I use it to celebrate a good training session like the pushup
00:06:15 and pull-ups challenge up and ramping up for it has four flavors cocoa fruity frosted and blueberry I tried all of

00:06:53 and now here's my conversation with my dad Alexander Friedmann what to you is the most beautiful idea in physics chemistry
00:07:04 or mathematics whoo let's go to that place first before we go to the to Kiev of the most beautiful in physics
00:07:15 chemistry I would say I would say Einstein his ideas regarding stochastic motion and Brownian motion I think it is
00:07:28 the most beautiful clear simple idea because from these like statistics you can prove existence of molecules believe
00:07:37 me or not it was I think it was his first publication in 1905 with his first wife it was significantly her idea
00:07:47 that's right there were collaborators yes those five four four five papers he published yeah I actually almost
00:07:54 everything which Einstein did it was published the most important stuff they were published in one here one nine on
00:08:04 five but the first idea was probably the most elegant cases charge Brownian motion and why you think it's beautiful
00:08:14 if you see that people at that time they understand that if molecules if they exist their motion is absolutely chaotic
00:08:22 boom-boom boom-boom-boom what he proved the dust matter what size of particles is there motionless similar
00:08:34 about the same so it is not necessary to see molecules you can look at bigger particles like if you smoke there is
00:08:42 particles and you can see like a propagation of this smoke and from here determine behavior of molecules and
00:08:55 that's actually relatively short very elegant very clear and at that point people they kept talking about molecules
00:09:04 but it was no proof because there is no like a super electronic microscope to see them so you know I'm saying yes
00:09:10 molecules they exist you said well I mean can you show me there so my Stein made it and booked and he
00:09:18 proved that a lot of people after these public hearings that probably molecules really exists Einstein in 1905
00:09:28 so what do you like about that idea the isn't olicity simplicity that's what it is we proving something very very very
00:09:37 very very very complicated so if I ask you for example you know molecules like this can you prove it obviously like now
00:09:45 you would say ok I have a special electronic microscope and I can we'll take a look that small ok but when you
00:09:54 go back to beginning of 20th century people they were laughing can you prove sons you know you can no no no no take a
00:10:01 look it's something very simple very very simple very very simple what do you think it takes to do that kind of
00:10:09 thinking and come to those ideas and how many times have you encountered those kinds of ideas in your life have you had
00:10:20 any yeah yeah I would say that's that's the whole beauty my feeling that's the whole beauty of science it's
00:10:28 just you know people they say no no no no it's so - it's impossible or and you say no no wait take a look take a look
00:10:34 wait a second did they take a look just think for five minutes if something is very complicated you know kapitza Nobel
00:10:42 Prize all right like I work with him by the way he used to say if it is complicated it's probably wrong
00:10:51 ah well it was a lot of discussion didn't kapitza inland ow because Landau he he enjoyed to do something in a most
00:11:04 complicated way why his friend Kapisa he was trying to do everything is an absolutely simple way and they had all
00:11:12 these discussions because sometimes capital he went to extremes and he used to say well this is simple it means this
00:11:24 is right now he was like okay you means that everything we simple is right i mean like Fineman - yeah you like the
00:11:33 simple yes yes yes yes that's the whole point to find this simplicity that's that's the beauty of science that's a
00:11:41 beauty really there's a beautiful that's something worse to do like at the risk of going religious for a second
00:11:51 why do you think our universe allows for such simplicity to be discovered that such simplicity exists at all I can I
00:12:02 can tell you it is very similar to Darwin's theory why I don't know why animals they're this way not the other
00:12:11 way so it is actually competition take a look about simplicity in beauty of physics like you have two interacting
00:12:22 planets and the force is proportional to one over R squared in this case they are able to go in circles or
00:12:34 ellipses if there is another law they are either falling or we're out so like so if like our solar system exists so
00:12:46 just the interactions would be at 1 over R squared that's it it's very interesting about Isaac Newton and his
00:12:54 way of thinking that's also was the super I would say genius is it weird to you talking about noon that action a
00:13:05 distance for example this stuff I was doing in elementary school which is funny which without any knowledge of
00:13:11 physics but I I was doing physics because of fighting throwing things how better than that better than that we
00:13:24 played well it was 3rd 2nd 3rd gray so it's in 1962 1963 so from one hand you know key if that time so people they
00:13:36 were excited about worse obviously always especially boys and also you know we were way better than Americans
00:13:45 because you know we have first picnic yeah and Gagarin I remember how happy we were when was good Irene a year yo I'm afraid
00:13:57 to make a mistake but I think it's 1961 or 1962 in 1961 1962 because what I remember that I was in there either in
00:14:09 first grade or a second grade and it was no bread delivery or not at that time was a big problem because of Khrushchev
00:14:16 and the carriage of shortage of bread shortage of all kinds of food no potatoes no it was a mistake actually of
00:14:24 crucial because when he came to America he saw that corners everywhere and he decided yeah that if he put enough corn
00:14:34 in Russia Russia will be way stronger from the point of Agriculture than America
00:14:42 and but he overdid it as a result it was a shortage of wheat so that's why I remember this moment
00:14:50 so just for kids lastly you remember so yes so for kids what it is no no no no each day yeah during the class you know
00:14:59 the special guy used to come and give a small piece of white bread to each kid white bread
00:15:07 yeah white bread and at the same time like a teacher and I always forgot about this
00:15:18 Gagarin went to the space and kids they even forgot about this the bread so that's how big of a moment it is then
00:15:25 you're near I got bad take a look if you are a boy you think about leasing out space so like a 1/2 of voice they want
00:15:33 to be astronauts cosmonauts who we used to say and the other half wanted to design rockets so I was from this second
00:15:45 part so myself with friends we start designing small rockets to fight second grade second grade a second third second
00:15:58 third grade and we have been fighting with these guys from a next-door house because these idiots they used to use
00:16:07 only stones against us well and it was a big fence between houses so jazz they throw stones and we decided to make
00:16:20 rockets well and we made it and a scientist was born engineer - yes it was both science and engineering well let me
00:16:29 ask was at that moment or in general when did you first fall in love with science I would say science I think
00:16:39 clearly this fight with these beds the rawest there are the kids with which keep throwing stones from another side
00:16:52 of the fence and we start making rockets what has he been a rocket as a fuel we use a mixture of photographic films with
00:17:04 special chemicals yeah we consulted with the boys from high school about some details and we'd made it more or less
00:17:15 and then it was that stuff was actually wrapped into the silver foil and in the end we put like a match so with another
00:17:27 match we light it and this stuff was going like sometimes ten meters yeah and it was able to go to like 2 meters high
00:17:38 but very often it was mistakes because like we were bad with stability so what I try to calculate at this moment is
00:17:47 elect a trajectory stability meaning while it's in the air yeah control problem yes yes control Sheikh so I try
00:17:58 to try to calculate what motion to describe the moment where to point it so where to point it to be sure that it
00:18:05 will go far enough and it will go above the defense which was maybe one meter eighty or something
00:18:14 like that so so what was most interesting to you the calculations of the math physics of calculating the
00:18:22 trajectory or the fact that you could engineer build something that's based on science in in the beginning in the
00:18:29 beginning in the beginning to be honest I was happy to fight these idiots and I have title defense yeah which what's
00:18:39 funny that we used to do that and and they kept throwing stones which actually you cannot prove anything but then in
00:18:48 the end of this period actually I fall in love please science what is science to you so there
00:18:56 in the inner period your eight-year-old here one of teen events so not just to throw a stone but just to make something
00:19:07 and just and take a look we made it so the the the creation yeah and also another important stuff when you are
00:19:16 doing this kind of stuff so your friends they start thinking that you are not so bad you know also it's a way to earn respect
00:19:26 credit on their on the playground yeah yeah we were not interested in girls you know when you are like a second third
00:19:35 grade we just do we hated girls yeah but it was very important to have respect from yeah from well always follow along
00:19:42 right yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a camaraderie and just feeling and secret from parents and just to linger in it
00:19:49 because you brought it up Gagarin yeah what are your thoughts you know it's inspired on the American
00:19:56 side the Apollo missions inspired an entire generation of scientists what was your thought about Gagarin and the space
00:20:06 race and how that made you feel what were role did it play in your life to be honest the whole country had a huge
00:20:15 respect to Gagarin he was a nice person very simple and he was hero because you know to be first to go to the space yeah
00:20:23 knowing the percentage of success at the time with dogs was way far from 100% it's a big deal I would not say that it
00:20:34 inspired like a science science no it did not but making rockets it was just
00:20:42 interesting and about America we are way better than America that's the way we have been thinking I mean come on is
00:20:48 that yeah that's it was even not a question yeah in America was saying the same it's propaganda I was its
00:20:57 propaganda but keep in mind very very important actually at that time in these years Russia was way ahead yeah there is
00:21:08 it was no NASA that's right that's so the fact that Russia is way ahead is what motivated America to really step it
00:21:16 up it's from one hint but from another hand for Russian kids of a second grader and third grade mmm-hmm come on we did
00:21:24 not think about America that's like you know yeah that's millions miles away yeah besides physics
00:21:35 you also have poetry in your blood so what has been your relationship to poetry music what role did you play in
00:21:44 your life poetry a lot but it is way later then then Elementary School actually like music wise you know like
00:21:59 Oh teenagers they're in love with music and it's just exactly the same now and would say at that time at that time we
00:22:16 were all in love with one special group which is Beatles and II and what was extremely positive later its I was in
00:22:30 sixth grade fifth grade of the 60 64 65 66 and in Soviet Union Beatles they were forbidden deliver not it was absolutely
00:22:43 strange but at the same time if something is forbidden that's exactly what you love most
00:22:52 so I remember that for my big successes in science I was awarded who is going to this best of the best
00:23:05 camps pioneer camps Arctic in Crimea and over there it was international so I met with I live together with group of
00:23:15 people from friends yeah because I was the only one kind of speaking fluently in French and we just made trade so we
00:23:28 gave whatever we used to have and we got Beatles records little records and we go yes that's the rebellion you're part of
00:23:36 it what about poetry what when did you first I mean you've written a lot of what poet what maybe do you remember an early poem
00:23:50 you've written a bad one no I started doing that late so it was I was in seventh grade I think that's late Oh
00:23:58 writing poetry I thought and writing poetry is a little bit related to when boys they start looking at girls it was
00:24:06 a little bit different eyes we just loved it somehow behind even not so much even laughs even just you know this
00:24:15 imagination right like way far from reality it's a it is romanticism were you a serious poet or or funny poem
00:24:23 because you have a lot of humor example it's later yeah but at that time as was extremely serious Mir
00:24:33 extremely romantic which never ever before after that is hardly management yeah but it is kind of a little bit like
00:24:43 a childish romanticism or childish I mean you know that bad but it was it's interesting enough that first poetry was
00:24:53 actually almost immediately from my purview very good it not like you know you're doing something not good and then
00:25:00 better and and better and then better mmm it's actually totally opposite best stuff which I wrote it was like a south
00:25:09 great well around more like eight and nice great and I wrote a lot at that time why do you think you were so what
00:25:16 does it mean what good is good poetry mean that means it's not cheesy it's beautifully worded and he crafted it yes
00:25:26 and so ha where did that come from was most people even great poets are terrible at first so why why were you so
00:25:34 clever quickly as most people know you as really fine clever no I mean would words write very young words so you're
00:25:43 saying that was early on you already had that yes I have no good answer it comes from nowhere
00:25:55 yeah from but Michael Rockets just don't know it woody poet wasn't recognized it was it was actually to be honest no not
00:26:06 so much connection but in Russian culture romanticism it is extremely important element you know starting from
00:26:15 19th century Romanticism so yes it was very popular so either you are writing good poetry or bad poetry or you are an
00:26:23 artist you are like a you know painting something so I have a lot of friends they do painting do you remember poetry
00:26:31 do you remember a poem from that time you've written by any chance yeah sure I remember most of them by heart you
00:26:41 mind you mind reciting their in Russian Russian is good as long as they're not in French I have in French oh you wanna
00:26:51 me just do what do you think what what's comfortable you know maybe I will read one poor one point which I like most
00:27:04 from that period and I'm not sure that I wrote something better after that well it's a little bit cheesy however but not
00:27:15 much yeah it's like it's even not about girls it's about music but still remain a romanticized kind of wisdoms
00:27:26 very strong medicine act was the result of me reading a book particular janeyah catimor historia de chine another kappelmeister
00:27:36 organic wrestler actually the story of a cat who found the book or like a notebook but the
00:27:49 notebook of people he starts reading about that and analyzing their life so the life of people through eyes of a
00:27:59 very very smart cat so then I can read it in Russian right and in the spoiler if you want please I'll be doing ok

00:29:13 great so this eight eight great it's very 15 that is that's very good yeah and it's a that's a romanticism you know
00:29:23 I was a little bit of like it too much it's musically cheesiness a little bit I would say but very strong
00:29:34 so let's go let's go okay to Kiev okay let's go to Kiev you were born and raised in Kiev just like yes the guys
00:29:41 with the rocks and the Rockets but that was the guys you know I get word he got that you
00:29:50 can hold a grudge what are some memories of your dad and mom that stand out and okay yeah
00:30:01 what we do well let's drink in Japanese so yeah what are we drinking Japanese whiskey in Japanese whiskey they call it
00:30:13 from the barrel or not sponsored by NECA whiskey but in the whiskey yeah we do not but they're doing a very very good job
00:30:25 yeah and they are in Sapporo it's Hokkaido north of Japan so they are doing good beer which is superb
00:30:36 they good very good whiskey and a lot of red caviar and make sure that's it did you ever think when you were that
00:30:46 shortage of bread and you're doing the rocket that you'll be sitting here in America few years later drinking
00:30:56 Japanese whiskey talking about caviar did you even know what caviar was oh no no obviously because scaler it was for
00:31:03 holidays a little bit and it was distributed it's not like you're going buy it but you got it a little bit like
00:31:13 a small can so we all of us we knew that and just it was very popular and well let me just
00:31:24 actually ask that question how did you imagine what where you would be 50 years from then I think how did you think
00:31:42 about your future actually like in about eight grades nine grades I was very very very very very very good in physics
00:31:50 mathematics and chemistry so I was actually in this system of like an Olympiad so-called competition
00:32:00 I was absolutely number one in Ukraine twice and absolute number two in Soviet Union also twice this is physics
00:32:11 competition or mathematics okay it was physics so therefore people who don't know maybe you can explain I mean this
00:32:17 is still goes on to this day these are very intense competitions I don't know if they're that popular in the United
00:32:23 States probably because the United States folks don't do is great but I there it is extremely popular but not in
00:32:31 physics what is going on in this country I was very much impressed it's a very serious and very tough competition in
00:32:38 mathematics in math that's right in physics class and biology last so you already know new somewhat in eighth
00:32:46 grade that you're very good and yes wait a minute you said chemistry - yes of chemistry - physics chemistry and
00:32:52 competed you won in Ukraine and I was number two in Soviet Union it was twice now very interesting that in Soviet unit
00:33:02 was a rule you supposed to choose so you can participate in this competition in physics mathematics and chemistry
00:33:12 and all three of them up to the level of championship of the region of the big city in my cases was Kiev but then to go
00:33:24 to competition in Ukraine you have to choose you can go to only to one so I want physics and chemistry and
00:33:34 mathematics in Kiev then I choose physics and I was going to Ukrainian now if you win in Ukraine so a couple of
00:33:44 people from the whole Ukraine goes to this championship of Soviet Union that's an incredible accomplishment whether
00:33:54 using it was I mean you basically you peaked in terms of physics and poetry at age 14 that's a big difference you know
00:34:05 in physics I was really on top of the Soviet Union which is a huge country in poetry it was just but no I'm not a
00:34:12 professional you know and you can't compete in poetry way yeah well by the way over there gold
00:34:20 medal from high school so what you call here a valedictorian which is hard to do I would say here it's also very the
00:34:30 announcing independent school but in Kiev it was an interesting situation because oh you have to the most
00:34:38 difficult was actually not physics mathematics and it was writing but because it was writing not on the
00:34:45 computer without spellcheck it just and you have to write hard to when you let me see let me hear no 12 12 pages as
00:34:59 minimum of an essay and it's supposed to be zero mistakes and the Russian language is not the
00:35:08 easiest one and when you say mistakes I mean this is what makes the grammar real wrong mistake it's not just its grammar
00:35:15 it's writing mistakes - oh no I wouldn't mean writing mistake I just incorrect use of word or something can you cross
00:35:25 stuff out no right this is the you can't make a mistake in the actual writing process you're writing with a pen
00:35:33 yeah and immersive you're not supposed to make any direction and you're not allowed to cross the lines and that's
00:35:41 its perfection in song and all the victory is for me and it's silly but me what do you think about that is it what
00:35:51 what do you think about that strictness because it it it's easy to criticize from a distance but there's something
00:35:58 powerful about it yes there is it you know what counter is more powerful from this point of view is Japan is pest retinas
00:36:10 I was so much impressed with their kids what they keep saying that in Japan for kids it does matter it's a holiday or the
00:36:20 weekend or whatever each day you supposed to train with these Japanese characters because it's not it's just
00:36:29 impossible just to remember it so they are there working too hard but as a result they can say for them koala t
00:36:37 because quality means no mistakes alright that's very interesting point what does mean quality it means no miss
00:36:47 isn't perfectionism perfectionism creates this kind of whiskey yeah which this is what perfect
00:36:55 tastes like it's interesting I mean it forces you to take this education seriously everything seriously like this
00:37:03 yeah this craftsmanship it did cross me seriously yes yes yes and you know I I mentioned to you this exam this exam in
00:37:14 in Russian I say but it was something which was worse than that yeah because because it was Kiev we
00:37:24 supposed to take two essays one in Russian language and also in Ukrainian language so think for a second it's a
00:37:36 it's not your native language and he's supposed to also write this at least 12 pages without with zero mistakes and
00:37:47 without any possibility to make any it should be perfect as a result was funny that I speak Ukrainian not bad at all
00:37:57 because of this I wouldn't say that's a good idea but it's it's kind of Russian Russian version of of a Japanese story
00:38:05 but yeah you know there's a lot of interesting other strict things I get to memorize poetry here to memorize things
00:38:10 which I mean that's a really interesting exercise oh that's what probably you remember yeah though it still was there
00:38:17 when I was there yeah yeah like I used to know at least thousand poems by heart by heart and you still remember many of
00:38:28 your own by heart yeah it's by the way helps this mathematics how good memory just memory okay so you said you already
00:38:36 knew I mean it's an incredible incredible accomplishment to be at that level in physics at that young age so
00:38:45 what did you think about the future returning to the original question where do you think that would take you this
00:38:52 fascination and this skill with physics did you imagine hiding a professor did you imagine being Hine Stein
00:39:02 you know kids in high school I mean at least between us and I was like already in in high school it was like special
00:39:12 high school in physics and mathematics we were all like not only dreaming but being sure we can do that we can be best
00:39:25 of the best in the world and and it was very popular subject at that time if you are like the best thing in physics it's
00:39:32 the way more you are way more popular than a guy who is the best in basketball yes interesting I mean that's why do you
00:39:39 think that isn't a Soviet Union that it was so respected it's so admired when you were great at science it was
00:39:49 propaganda so was the state created there yes so and it was good do you think we'll ever see that in America
00:39:57 without authoritarian in a democracy because in America Brad Pitt and Michael Jordan are the superstars and scientists
00:40:05 most people don't know a single scientist except Einstein in America well I would say my feeling it should
00:40:13 happen in America it should happen to two boys and girls in America it should be sure it meaning like that's a good
00:40:20 thing or is everything anyway it is very important because if if kids in America they are just not so much good in
00:40:33 sciences sooner or later we will lose competition to to countries where science is very much high prestige
00:40:46 example today unfortunately not Russian the best example today is probably chain I I've been there I saw their high
00:40:56 schools we have to be very careful with that so my feeling that that it should be done because in America university
00:41:07 education is way stronger than in Russia and they're way stronger than in Europe but high school education in America is
00:41:21 not so so strong well yeah it's difficult to understand why but why what do you think the universities are so
00:41:27 strong in America why do you think the most Nobel prizes are from America why do you think science is so good even
00:41:35 though scientists were never really worshipped in America because in Russia it was always a problem so the strongest
00:41:43 you know that people students kids they they're they are very hard workers when they are in high school because after
00:41:53 that there is a very strong competition to get to a good university very very very challenging the same in China so
00:42:03 you have to be very good to enter very good University so kids they work like crazy to do that also boys they knew
00:42:14 that they have take a look you have one chance in most of cases with exception of couple of universities have only one
00:42:22 chance to go to one University to try yourself if you make it you become a student if not you go to the army for three years
00:42:34 so you it's very interesting it's a very psychologically interesting situation because what is going on you have to
00:42:42 make a decision by yourself are you strong enough to go to the best place because it's only one place you can go
00:42:52 now they start changing this system but in 1960 seventies eighties nineties it was the case so just another cost
00:43:00 because the feeling once you're choosing you don't get in course not money-wise but real cost
00:43:07 if you are a boy if you if you just overestimate yourself mm-hmm is that when you got that line in your hair that
00:43:17 that period so for people who don't know my dad's hair now is white but he used to have the sexy stripe down the middle
00:43:25 for many decades yeah yeah yeah 10 20 30 a lot of my pictures I have this right now anymore nothing he wants a good look now
00:43:33 so anyway is that when you got a distress that's when you were oh no the stress was it was a real stress what
00:43:40 happened well that's that's a bad story I told you that in when I was a finishing high school as it turns great
00:43:52 the time I became a champion of Ukraine number one and second in Soviet Union which was a very very big deal after
00:44:02 that five kids on six no five five kids from Soviet Union was supposed to go to international competition and this
00:44:13 international competition was the same dates as you know exams to enter the university so if you are a champ if you
00:44:25 are like in five best five best kids in physics five best kids in mathematics five best kissin whatever chemistry they
00:44:38 were able to skip these final exams which means to skip this essay in language one languages say another
00:44:47 language and you skip all exams but instead of that you prepare to international competition so because I
00:44:57 was number two I was clearly the team so I was not supposed to go to this stupid exams and but well but it was a telephone call
00:45:11 of our leader from Moscow he said that like it's like one week before but unfortunately you have to be replaced
00:45:19 with another guy because they are unable to give you a visa oh and that was actually yeah that was a stress it was
00:45:28 it was a very big stress and at that point like people including those from America and scientists motion they came
00:45:39 to me and they asked me you know to make speech and just to say something and to do something and they talked to my dad
00:45:46 to your grandfather hi he spoke with people from KGB because he was like the guy had time and and he
00:45:58 came to me and said okay you do whatever you want because it's your life you make a decision but they told me that if you
00:46:10 forgot about what happened you have gold medal which is over there you pass all exams and you will have a well five in
00:46:21 Russian a highest grade whatever you do it will be a yeah and then you go to any university you want and you'll be
00:46:32 accepted this is KGB talking those kinds of folks yeah and I hesitate it and I said well yeah I agree I am I I will not
00:46:47 fight against the system so can you explain a little bit does you being Jewish have anything to do with it
00:46:54 absolutely it's 100% okay so because it was actually it was a 1970 and in this moment it was very significant
00:47:06 actually push the immigration for Jewish people to Israel and to America and they they were afraid always and they just
00:47:17 give all these awards to the to the guy and he will say okay guys goodbye I just decided to go to whatever to America or
00:47:26 to Germany or whatever or to Israel keeping that in mind just in case they prefer not to give Iza and at that time
00:47:37 interesting enough is KGB so they do not give visa and they do not give any explanation why right just you cannot do
00:47:50 that however however they say he's a good guy and if he accepts that will do everything for him
00:48:02 don't worry it's also risk because you never know they can but I don't know maybe maybe I am so smart but actually
00:48:09 without special preparation I went to these super exams and I got a you did well how did well so and that's the
00:48:20 reason of this stripe which appeared in very short bundes it was a source of stress but I'm not exactly understanding
00:48:29 the depth of the stress it was very cg / - ways to make I mean it doesn't feel like there's a choice he just had
00:48:36 actually when already I made a decision I was already with the store okay so the decision process was because I was it's
00:48:46 like you know I was falling from a limp or whatever like because I I was feeling that everything is like I'm best of the
00:48:57 best in the world whatever and boots they actually put me on my place you know it was difficult moment but but then I
00:49:10 was accepted and it wasn't you know immediately celebration because you know I got this gold medal which is a big
00:49:16 deal in Soviet Union the gold represents being a valedictorian well it's very right so did you experience anti-semitism
00:49:26 leading up to that moment in your life did you feel that you were what you mean to feel that you were Jewish did you
00:49:34 experience life as a as a Ukrainian Jew or simply as a Ukrainian well for the listener that is uncomfortable talk
00:49:45 likes to avoid uncomfortable conversations so I have to force them into uncomfortable conversations okay oh
00:49:54 well it's not only me just like all our generation in at that time in Ukraine in Ukraine Ukraine at that time it was not
00:50:05 the same as Ukraine today so level of anti-semitism was way higher in Ukraine than in other places in other soviet
00:50:19 republics all right why is that is there any historical yes reason phalanges well it was actually
00:50:27 historical significantly historical reason starting from bogdan Olinsky so at some point a couple of hundred years
00:50:37 before that Jews they supported polish people and it was against Russia against the grain so just a level of
00:50:46 anti-semitism was very high in this kind of countries also this area was inside of Pale of Settlement which was a lot of
00:50:56 Jews a lot of Jews a lot of problem with Jews in Moscow it was forbidden for Jews to leave so no no Jews no problems so
00:51:06 when I actually moved from Kiev to Moscow it is like a day and night so Moscow it was beautiful I mean I did not
00:51:15 feel well I feel felt but not my charity in Ukraine always I felt that I am Jewish but from another hand you
00:51:23 remember all these kids from our yard like a stone that's that they're opposed both groups a were Jewish yeah
00:51:30 so what I'm trying to say that Jews they lived actually together so from that point of view you know it's less it's a
00:51:40 huge anti-semitism but but they are somewhere you're somewhat isolated from it because because it's like a Jewish
00:51:46 gigantic together I mean they juice it was its historical ghetto yeah okay let's let's jump back okay we were
00:51:54 saying that you were born and raised in Kiev what what are your favorite or maybe most representative memories of
00:52:17 well it was a beautiful family you're the only chance you're just i was only charged one yes and my father he was a
00:52:31 hero of World War two and he was actually always with a stick because you know he was like a cane yeah cane right
00:52:41 he was heavily wounded even in the war and he operated the the gun the machine gun he's a goner very complicated situations
00:52:53 huh so he was risking his life enormous Lee and the only reason he survived because he was heavily wounded so just
00:53:00 it was the end of the war for him and you know and as a boy you know for me he was eerie and he was a real hero he was
00:53:10 like you know it's not it's very different for me he's like a big hand you know like always he was not drinking
00:53:18 Japanese whiskey he was drinking only one thing what yeah he remember like we had somewhere this yeah we'll get to the
00:53:25 bar yeah but what I'm trying to say that it's a different personality and he just from this Jewish boy he
00:53:35 became an associate minister of construction of Ukraine which was a very big deal so he was like this he's very
00:53:44 much different from me I'm like a little bit like a software personality my like my mother but he was a very tough guy
00:53:54 yeah were you afraid of him what does mean to be afraid he loved me but he was a person like you know very
00:54:03 strong personality so yes well if I did something wrong how you remember the story no no I mean these idiots from
00:54:14 another from the yeah in this rockets so yes I was afraid of my father so I had huge respect and my mother she was like
00:54:28 a nice Jewish mother and it well let me kind of ask a hard question to you've lost your dad a few years ago yeah what
00:54:36 did it feel like when you learned that he died what went through your head what memories well like you know losing
00:54:56 your parents it's excluding your parents so I would say what I can say it's a losing paradin and my father it was a
00:55:04 whole generation you know it's just like and you know the feeling you have that now you are the man that's interesting
00:55:14 whether the killing is now it's my trying to be great now just I have to do something now just because when you have
00:55:20 your parents you always have this feeling that there is something behind you just in case yeah and my father he
00:55:30 was very very very strong personality just this interesting story that during this mmm Jews persecution in 1952 by Stalin
00:55:44 when it was so-called a fair of doctors or whatever how to say in English deliberately when Jewish people were
00:55:55 actually said just their doctors and okay most of nocturnal were Jewish Wesley so they used to say that they
00:56:04 actually kill half of the government or whatever as a doctors it was absolutely lie it just says nothing with reality
00:56:11 and Jews they were prepared actually to be moved from all over so it Union to be a began to like a close to Chinese
00:56:22 border on a more River like oh it's already they try to move them closer to Japan to Japan is whiskey so like in
00:56:31 camps know what just just just just kind of move them straight to to the so called the Jewish published Jewish
00:56:41 region or whatever but it's like it was nothing there yeah and if you move like this kind of group of people I was about
00:56:50 three million Jews not forget you know at least half will die just during this moving so it was nice and you're
00:56:57 preventing them from having a future yeah so at that time you know people they kept start kept talking about the
00:57:04 same stupid stuff that Jews a drink blood of babies of Christian babies yeah and and that's what my father used to
00:57:15 say that his friends and it's like you know it's like a meeting and you know people are asking have you seen
00:57:20 something have you seen him like a drinking blood or something like that and he said that he was absolutely in
00:57:27 products to his friends and all of them they mostly I mean they are or either leaving the room just not to participate
00:57:36 in this stupidity war they say we haven't seen but who knows if people they write in newspapers is a very
00:57:42 strong propaganda so they he lost he was a associate they say that he's supposed to leave
00:57:59 because because this whole propaganda he's a Jew and choose a drink in the blood of Christian baby
00:58:06 maybe maybe who knows yes maybe it's enough there's no evidence that they're not yes right so so he is not going to
00:58:13 prison but he is not going to work in our enterprise so he said okay I am like a social director and I want to be a
00:58:21 worker a simplest worker but because I love my plants he said no so actually he left it was what was that memory
00:58:32 standout for you why because it was it was 1952 and I was born in 1953 so just so what was happening that he was
00:58:40 without job for one year because nobody wanted to to take him before Stalin died in 1953 it was home and when I was born
00:58:50 so my mother she worked to support the whole family and we lived in a small room 14 square meters it was my
00:58:57 grandmother grandfather father mother and me so the I mean the it's kind of it was a big impact on and then Stalin died
00:59:12 and everything become way better is and in terms of anti-semitism as well you see there is a good movie by the way
00:59:27 made here in America a Russian Jews part 1 and Jews / - lysandros part 3 I think it's a Youtube version yeah so what is that
00:59:38 it was almost no anti-semitism before World War 2 right it was very strong anti-semitism after the end of the World
00:59:46 War 2 and in 1945 and death of Stalin in 1953 in 1953 serration become better but not
00:59:58 as good way not as good as in the nineteen thirties why was there anti-semitism after the
01:00:03 war the Second World War it seems the idea hearted Russia sorry to interrupt
01:00:11 how did Russians in your memory think about the the the cruelty of the Holocaust because there's so much pride
01:00:22 about Russia winning the war of being the you know to getting to Berlin isn't how do you think about the people that
01:00:32 were tortured well well I read it very strong very strong propaganda propaganda very strong propaganda so what happened
01:00:41 that okay what actually happened that in the end of okay before World War two yeah before world war ii actually jewish
01:00:52 people they just they forgot that they're Jews it was mmm I mean they were all Soviet like a little bit first
01:01:00 Soviet first on way way first I mean it was before work in the end of the war Jewish people they create a lot of
01:01:08 special organizations and because of Holocaust they had significant support of United States of America and Western
01:01:18 countries but most United States of America and Jewish people in the end of over tool they start thinking that it's
01:01:27 like my story with this when I graduated from high school so they started believing that they are
01:01:34 big guys you know because I have so much support from the United States and it's also and and on top of that like a
01:01:45 and right I was around and so and I did 49 there's a kind of a push that Jews are no longer Soviets they their
01:01:56 homeland is yes and and Jews a felt like a initially very nice but they overdid it so bottom line it was a and also don't
01:02:07 not to forget about Hitler so as a result level of anti-semitism in from 1945 to 1953 was growing significantly
01:02:20 then it was a little bit better but actually significant improvement starts happening only in 1960s not earlier than
01:02:32 that so can you talk a little bit more about your dad's journey in World War 2 I mean there's I remember a bunch of
01:02:40 stories but you know just for people interested you know is World War two is at the core of our family in a sense so
01:02:50 can you just linger and maybe if you have memories about it his impact how did he get injured was his relationships
01:02:59 with you know violence with death was bullets flying everywhere yeah my father he was born in 1923
01:03:13 so in night and we're in Minsk in Minsk which is now with Russia and he was born in October so when world war started he
01:03:30 was 17 and it was forbidden to go to army if you are younger than 18 so together with his friends they may
01:03:41 change in a spurt they just change their year from they made themselves one year older just to
01:03:52 be accepted to the army and interesting enough that like the way I understand at least these people who organized like a
01:04:03 army they understand they saw that this boys are younger but they let go he wanted to go what he wanted to go you
01:04:11 know there's so many stories and you know more in America where there's there's a lot of people brave people who
01:04:21 found ways to not go yeah here it's absolutely opposite it's absolutely opposite because most
01:04:31 well not not everybody over this one but majority propaganda was extremely strong so protecting your father and mother one
01:04:42 its he was to die for your country yes yes yes so to die for your country it was kind
01:04:48 of like an honor yeah that's and also they were sure that's Red Army his hungry trans
01:05:02 stronger than this Germans yeah so and they thought that okay we'll go there so couple of months and we are winners but
01:05:11 in one way or another but they were wanted to go especially when you know you're not like a very rich guy you know
01:05:26 so he went to the army and it was like a couple of months special preparation to become like a lowest level of officers
01:05:40 so junior latent or whatever it is in this country and he became like this low-level officer and he starts actually
01:05:54 I near Moscow and just start going back and back and back and back and and that's it and he was with this machine
01:06:07 gun big one and you know the change of like it was very fast so people they were killed very very very fast actually
01:06:14 people that were operating machine guns yeah ah very very fast because just finish the changeover
01:06:24 change so he became division commander reasonably fast decision region that's one way to move up on everybody's dying
01:06:33 yeah yeah yeah yeah and what he kept saying I think even to you because he just it was like he kept saying that for some
01:06:43 reason he was absolutely sure that every year he saw that like everybody else had killed and he's not so he was kind of
01:06:52 sure that something is protecting him he's invincible and yes he's invincible he he and I wasn't writing and he was
01:06:59 very strong actually very very very strong like by the way physically and mentally physically and mentally so kind of like
01:07:10 helix I mean he is like because this dude would not like myself but he is very physically strong and mentally protected
01:07:21 like I don't know what best way to say that he's he was sure in himself and he was sure that there's a confidence is
01:07:29 that yeah yeah yeah no no no it's not it's a confidence it's a constant a little bit like a kind of like a
01:07:35 religious but here he he did not believe to the gap through the first place come but he believed in what he was to say in
01:07:43 his star services there is a star which protects him and I be right and he might be right
01:07:53 he survived war he got he survived war because after like for no like five or six months he was heavily wounded which
01:08:04 was very good yeah actually because that's right he's right in the leg in the leg yeah so he was like and he had a
01:08:15 lot of this horse do you remember what about the people in general you know 20 million plus Soviet
01:08:25 people died what impact do you remember what impact the war had on the people is enormous enormous that's why for 20
01:08:37 million it is a lot and it's a need I half of them were just civilians because Stalin he just operated this war without
01:08:51 counting people yeah but do you think it had powerful creative impact in terms of music art literature the science a sad
01:09:03 thing about war all all of the above science mostly all of the above it because even before war science was very
01:09:16 much pushed up but after the war scientists they were considered like the key people in the world especially
01:09:22 military scientist I don't think I've ever asked you this I haven't asked you most of the things I'm
01:09:33 asking but you're Jewish Hitler killed a lot of Jews how did you feel about the Holocaust I don't think we've actually
01:09:41 really talked about is it just an intellectual tragedy to you or did it ever feel I know I but what do you think
01:09:54 about human nature after that who is he that I have parents and my parents they have parents which my grandparents and
01:10:08 they're my great-grandparents so all of those all of those without exception were killed in Holocaust zero died with
01:10:19 their own death natural death all of them they were killed because they were like already a little bit older like I
01:10:31 am now and they were sure that Germans they will not touch them come on just do something to old people itself strange
01:10:40 and all of them without exception all of know they were killed so it is you know like initially in my life I just it was
01:10:55 like a really hatred with respect to Germans in general which only later I mean it was clear that it's not it's not
01:11:04 say it's not German in Germany but that's but it was very serious feelings about that so hatred but so as you as
01:11:18 you grew grew up did it are you hopeful about whether people are good or evil and did that have a impact
01:11:28 on you know the fact that you can see so much evil you can become cynical the way you still did you is there still
01:11:39 an optimistic positive person inside you yeah there is I am optimistic myself I am optimistic
01:11:54 so just like the point is that like I was when I just start growing up even even in high school level of
01:12:07 anti-semitism was like a way lower and in general I felt myself always way more Soviet then I was a Russian Ukrainian or
01:12:19 Jewish sure so what what was your relationship of the Soviet Union we'll talk about coming
01:12:27 to America but what was your feeling so you're proud for it for many years I was very proud I was very proud of this
01:12:37 style of life where science is really popular where people they're working not for money but people are working for
01:12:45 form to make something interesting to make something good it's the place where if you if you if you're good you are
01:12:55 rewarded and that was a healing it was propaganda obviously so for like when I was in high school middle school high
01:13:10 school and I would say in school I was feeling that I'm extremely proud so again then it was this shock change
01:13:21 and then a lot of friends I started going to Israel or America so just everything start changing
01:13:28 every since I've chased after Stalin after though it's you know it's wait so it's already I'm talking about like
01:13:36 1970s in the 70s yeah the 1970s already like people they against our feeling that they're Jewish
01:13:48 because of significant immigration to America and Israel okay say you were in Kiev through high school mmm-hmm so
01:13:56 let's look to your next chapter of your life and can you tell me what is fist yeah since as its I don't even know what
01:14:07 the full in English name is Moscow Institute of Physics and technology and what is it in Russian the full name
01:14:15 Moskovsky facility hsk Institute em fat I it's it smells like MIT police yeah yeah yeah my PT yes yeah yeah it is am i
01:14:30 P TSD kind of it's a kind of a mighty I don't know it's maybe a little more like a Caltech oh no I was there an
01:14:37 engineering component it's very small right I mean what was it was the size of a cultic and it was very much focused on
01:14:54 science and military science and now sorry to interrupt no this was in Moscow yeah and so you came from Kiev the
01:15:03 Moscow Moscow so how did you get into DC so what yeah so you said this yeah cause this stuff is focused on science
01:15:11 military science this is like the I saw on the internet this description of maybe you can talk to it math and
01:15:22 physics education at MIT the number of hours I think or compared to fist yeah and they were I mean they were making
01:15:30 first of all the CCF education is shorter and covers a like an order of what can you explain what what that
01:15:45 experience is like what the with their idea of the kind of holiday they're putting you through is what the
01:15:52 philosophy but that is what I've been looking for because you know don't forget that well you're coming to the
01:16:01 place and you feel yourself best in the world and when you meet people from you know outside you're like a you're like a
01:16:11 different personality you are from mipt you are from from Castilla so it was a lot of songs a lot of it was a theory
01:16:23 and we were so much proud that number of credit hours it was incredibly we work from 9:00 to
01:16:33 5:00 each day you can from 9:00 to 5:00 it is eight hours so it's eight hours of classes how many days a week six days a
01:16:47 week so you can count and it's and the level was and your requirements they're very very very very strong and it is
01:16:55 math physics chemistry what was the range of subjects important twice importantly like anyway when you enter
01:17:04 like a you start with very high level mathematics physics and chemistry actually and why did you want to call
01:17:15 this yeah so it's basically because you thought you were one of the best people in the world at math and physics yeah so
01:17:21 this is the place to go and chemistry yes in chemistry and that's that's that's the way to go by the way when I
01:17:27 came to Moscow I hesitated for about one day because I also I was in love with mathematics and mathematics meant like a
01:17:39 freedom so they had less classes they were more open for like creative thinking well this jacket
01:17:50 was like a what's the best word to say what they do like in sports like make like something extremely hard for you later
01:18:02 what's the name how you say for military for military from either and USA boot camp yeah when I said boot camp but yeah
01:18:12 this is really intense so innocence of weeding out week yes and that was going on actually so the significant number of
01:18:21 students they were actually living after the first semester yeah it was extremely challenging also keep in mind that it
01:18:33 was about okay usually group it was like a twenty five people thirty and usually one girl so it is like a whatever they
01:18:44 three percent girls ninety seven boys it's also create very special atmosphere well it's maybe just two before before
01:18:56 we get into the special atmosphere what was your journey to fish yeah like so I think I read a book a love and math
01:19:05 by ad Frankel also Russian I think he mentions he stuck in there and he's also Jewish and he said that there's a lot of
01:19:14 anti-semitism that that there's a bunch of schools that you weren't I mean it was either explicitly or implicitly no
01:19:22 Jews allowed yeah well so did you so what was the process of getting into this place and how much anti-semitism
01:19:30 was there one in that picture at that period it was 1970 it was a clear well it's anti-semitism yes absolutely
01:19:40 what but what I mean that it was like a for Jews it was really difficult to get into the universities very simple but in
01:19:52 most of universities the rule was kind of hidden so just it was like a Jewish boy and not Jewish boy and they were
01:20:01 going to the same exam and the professor gives like a G or C for the Jewish guy and like B or a for for a not Jewish guy
01:20:13 if their level is the same it was just in most of places but Moscow means the physics and technology it was very
01:20:21 different exams they were absolutely honest however however they count grades it was two exams in physics and two
01:20:35 exams in mathematics oral mathematics great mathematics or physics written discs a b c g and a is 5 B is 4G 3G is 2
01:20:52 and if you're Jewish an exam they were very very very very very very tough yeah the world I hear all of them and that
01:21:03 was written and oral they were extremely challenged but equally for doesn't matter you are Jewish or not Jewish
01:21:12 where iam now if you are Jewish you have to have to to go through that after have either 19 or 20 which means yeah which
01:21:22 means it should be a a a a or one day well if you are not Jewish 17 is absolutely ok 16
01:21:36 some people 15 some people so it was made clear and this beside that is completely fair it was you know it was
01:21:45 from some point of view it was good because it is not like a cheating it was like a clear rule let's do it all so it
01:21:53 was very interesting that after exams it was a special interview and was interviewers with really high level scientists it was
01:22:06 like it two or three famous famous famous scientists and one or two KGB people and and they just you know
01:22:18 managed this operation it is impossible to discuss so they say yes you are accepted great Cory they say no you're not
01:22:29 why that's our decision so what was your favorite subject topic ideas that you fell in love with in in the first few
01:22:41 years of this year it was general physics because we had absolutely beautiful a lecture and a half his books
01:22:51 even now I have over there he wrote like a lot of books solution see booking yeah and he was very interesting personality
01:23:02 I wasn't laughed with him for I would his idea was you have to present physics absolutely without calculus so it should
01:23:19 be no derivatives and no integration how's how's that possible just do you do physics you can most you say physics you
01:23:30 mean like mechanics oh no no no no no physics means physics it's mechanics it's a thermal sciences its electricity
01:23:39 optics and nuclear physics everything MODOK ever was that okay the only thing he didn't attach it was no quantum
01:23:47 mechanics was quantum mechanics in the air back then yeah obvious but not for this gentleman
01:23:55 not for this professor he was not so much he was no famous scientist he was a famous teacher and then only then I just
01:24:06 you know jump to the world of theoretical physics and and chemistry so and that the next
01:24:15 step in my life is just jumping into theoretical physics and what what branch of theoretical physics were you
01:24:23 interested in so I've never actually heard you talk much about the world is the big like general relativity so
01:24:34 looking out into the Stars you were more interested in like what physics phenomena were you interested in now or
01:24:43 that that so at that time at that time after this two years with civilian I just changed completely to absolutely
01:24:51 opposite approach to purely theoretical physics and at that time the most popular it was the so-called run down
01:25:03 minimum so run down ten books and they are believe me they are Wow so they are so hard yeah they are just
01:25:15 for some reasons areas you know hardest of the hardest like very challenging very difficult and it's the boy is so
01:25:22 just they say if you want to show yourself you have to go to the so-called endowment we should have to go through
01:25:29 ten exams actually eleven because the first one is was mathematics and then whatever physics one physics to physics
01:25:40 ten and you know it was a challenge it was very difficult I went through that just actually I don't know just to prove
01:25:47 yeah that I can do that to be honest I did not in the end at least I hate that because it was mm not so much
01:25:57 it is not fine one you know it is just something opposite to that do the opposite yeah yeah but it's it's painful
01:26:05 almost for the sake of being painful yes it's like it's like you are doing the martial arts yeah that's
01:26:15 just to show you yourself that you can do that yeah so that's what I did and then when I was actually I was keep
01:26:24 doing that but in the middle it was the first time when I came to Kolkata means to the photonic energy so speaking of
01:26:33 which what is the couch out of Institute of atomic energy and who was your so I feel like in VCF there's an advisor
01:26:42 mm-hmm so who was your advisor who were the mentors in in this period of your life  most greens the physics and
01:26:47 technology it's very interesting approach it's a so-called physics system yeah what does it mean it means at first
01:26:57 three years you work in classes and then you go to actual national labs and you choose them they choose us etc and three
01:27:11 years you work there and you listen to the classes but these classes they are not from teachers not from teaching
01:27:18 professors but from very very high level actual scientists so and who was so who was the the person who was the person
01:27:30 that you connected with who was your advisors in that fourth year fifth year yeah well and what's coach Atif so
01:27:38 that's one of that's that's the connection yeah yeah cool chatter it's that's downtown Moscow right oh yeah
01:27:46 yeah cool shot of its the guy is like a father of Russian atomic bomb and he build a bigger actor in central Moscow
01:27:57 the interest and all that it was in nineteen in 1919 1946 I think you know they do the first rector and then the
01:28:13 bump and 1949 so and it was a it's it's you know like in America there is a group of national labs different like
01:28:21 Oak Ridge National Lab Los Alamos National Lab Argonne National Lab etcetera in Russia I would say most of
01:28:29 this lab they were combined together in this one Kolkata Institute of atomic energy so
01:28:34 it's like you can imagine like a combination of most of American national labs in one place it was fifteen
01:28:42 thousand people working there fifteen thousands a huge it's like a sitting inside of city and when they were
01:28:51 created they were focused on nuclear physics and nuclear engineering and everything around development to build
01:29:02 atomic bomb and the same thing for fusion bombs so for hydrogen bound and but later they add solid phase physics
01:29:14 groups etc so yes it was a I would say any still now the most I would say the strongest research center and also with
01:29:26 you so I decided to go there and I decided to go to plasma so in January in 1972 I came to they did not let me
01:29:39 inside of crucial minutes I came only to the gate and I met my first professor who brought me there it was professor
01:29:50 Liang he threw the coffe he is now professor emeritus of University of Maryland I saw him couple of years ago
01:30:00 was that and he brought me to his house and he we spoke and just he said I just remember forever he he told me you want
01:30:10 it's like a the story with winnie pooh and he said you wanna tea with milk or with honey or and and my answer was exactly
01:30:19 the same as we needed poo I did not talk we need opposed that time I say okay all of the above please because why
01:30:30 because you're hungry very simple and he spoke to me and he started working it was and I made my first actually paper
01:30:41 you wrote your first paper that's who you were and I was on plasma it wasn't asthma and but then in the
01:30:51 half of a year he told me that he likes what we are doing but he will be unable to help me in the life because I am
01:31:01 Jewish and to a Jewish person even like absolutely brilliant to get inside of course Chetta you have a stronger
01:31:06 helpers and he recommend me to meet lagina rusinov and very early glasses at that moment so
01:31:13 it was a moment when I start new names I know well because of the song as this legendary so because of you I seem to
01:31:20 have met a lot of people from fist yeah yeah and much like MIT they're never shy about telling you that they're from fist
01:31:30 yeah there's a lot of pride so I notice on the fall maybe you can tell about him the other guy let me guess the gossip
01:31:38 when a lot of people these days know from the show of Chernobyl who is but he obviously has deep roots and coaches
01:31:48 often is a very interesting person so okay so rusinov who's this legendary human that I've heard so much about well
01:31:59 with you know that plasma fusion plasma Elysian talked only like making it stock market it is diagnostic such a
01:32:06 measurement characterization so the most challenging is how to measure it so Rose onif was world accepted as a father of
01:32:16 plasma diagnostics so he was a very very very nice person working with plasma diagnostics both
01:32:29 theory and experiments and at that time in 1973 approximately oh he decided he was asked by League Asif to start plasma
01:32:41 chemistry not plasma physics but plasma chemistry because they wanted to dissociate uranium hexafluoride and
01:32:50 plutonium hexafluoride and they were unable to do it without like in traditional ways and they decided write
01:32:59 plasma so and rusinov agreed to take a lead in plasma chemistry and at that point you see that I was in a good but
01:33:09 good moment you know in a good place so I was lucky actually because all of them they were physicists especially Roshan
01:33:20 of deeply deeply deeply physicists and he needs help from a good young person who is not afraid of chemistry being
01:33:30 physicist so he looked around and rudakov told him that there is a young guy very interesting personality he is a
01:33:36 good and physics but he's in laughs chemistry also so try him and to me he said go to row serif he's a tough guy
01:33:49 but but he will be able to help you because to help you to stay to go further in your life because his close
01:33:59 friend working together with Li Gosselin ligase was associate director vice-president of course Adam Institute
01:34:08 so that's how it's all started and they asked me a couple of things can you do this can you do that in chemistry so it
01:34:14 is just physicists and talking chemistry so let me step up because I'd like to step back in a little bit to talk about
01:34:22 of what is plasma even so but before all let's step away from science what impact did he have on you as a human being what
01:34:35 memories do you have of him that you love or hate or both you know I would say the best word would be both because
01:34:47 do you remember Ross on of hard to know what I remember because I just told me story personality he's the personality
01:34:59 he's he's extremely tough very quiet he is mostly not talking he's only looking at you always in your eyes he's like
01:35:12 well that's his brilliant smart he was absolutely smart absolutely brilliant so you can have very tough and tough and so
01:35:20 you have to basically makes for a great adviser because this is a person to be afraid of
01:35:25 yeah and you have to put you basically for the rest of your life are trying to prove yourself to him yes that's exactly
01:35:32 the case with a condition lady met rusinov yeah that's the personality yeah is there a memory a story that stands out
01:35:39 to you maybe that represents him well without going to science right without I remember one
01:35:48 story just forever one of the I was already not a postdoc well graded student so it was one under grade a
01:35:55 student you remember from third grade and muskiness physical ecology and she was supposed to start you know after
01:36:01 vacations she came but but something happened and she came about one week later so it's her advisor which is
01:36:18 another famous scientist and I was in an office of Mazzara so he brought this girl and it's a nice girl I had not so
01:36:29 many girls in EM IPT Investec not so many girls so she came to this office and rusinov
01:36:37 he just look at her like a snake you know like look at her without any words for about
01:36:45 maybe the one in 30 seconds just look at her eyes and then she said he said your colleagues they start working on the
01:36:59 wiki though your what your colleagues well other student yeah other students they are already working start working
01:37:09 one week ago that's all he said and kept looking at her just staring and staring right and she you know like his ears
01:37:18 started going from her face yeah and it was like a torture its he did injured by silence and staring yes yeah that's a
01:37:30 good like a three three minutes but even for me it was like maybe one hour for her maybe it's like whole life okay
01:37:39 let's go to the most important question how did you meet mom whoo so this is before coach shot off I
01:37:49 suppose around that nine it's no it is already i met mom in 1973 this is second third fourth year of yours
01:38:04 well this was my third year no it was my fourth year actually already and for mom it was a second one she was there yeah I
01:38:11 told you that it's like three percent so she was one of the girls on it being one of the special few in this special and
01:38:18 yeah and she survived this kind of fall so super training divided first year she survived everything yeah I mean so how
01:38:27 did how did you okay so there you are with a giant ego as we can already tell by the way does your ego serve you well
01:38:42 we'll talk about a little yeah more if you like yes I think yes what about so in science yes I think people will hear
01:38:49 that you have a bit of an ego but I think it's the into your it's the same with five
01:38:54 minutes the same with I just Leonard Susskind a lot of physicists have this weird dance with ego it's a useful weapon when
01:39:03 you wield a cautiously but did it help you in terms of with mom I would not say so about confidence
01:39:13 well how did you the most difficult yeah is you know to to go to this because it's a boy so and and girls they live
01:39:23 separately in different like this place these are alligators and like what I mean after you have to be clever and how
01:39:34 to get to this like a place I mean yeah ah so what happened that on their floor something disappeared I don't know some
01:39:42 money or whatever or some books or something and and a friend of mine he was you know like I would say dreaming
01:39:52 he we used to say so he was like a student responsible for like everything should be nice so I said that I will
01:40:02 help you let's go to these girls and let's try to to help them so we come em start helping and spend then the whole
01:40:21 night reading poetry just reading poetry I think with tea that's it reading poetry with tea was you and who else
01:40:33 me mom and to my friends and it was also two other girls which leaves the same so do you remember what poems you're really
01:40:41 is there something if you can imagine if we are talking about eight hours or whatever in seven hours so it was a lot
01:40:49 of for three but is it there's there something from that period that stands out to you maybe as poetry
01:40:58 that you were reading not something you've written for mom yet but do you remember from that night I mean it's an
01:41:05 important night right yeah oh they remember what kind of tea the cheap one because this song is stuff we used to
01:41:16 handle vodka so no no so ok tea and it's like a it was offensive for girls we had a huge respect to that and then
01:41:25 gentlemen don't drink vodka in fair enough so at least in the beginning so when did you first fall in love with mom
01:41:39 yeah you know when you have like you said it's 97 percent so jay-z important it's immediately one two three yes okay
01:41:52 so but she she was beautiful and she's beautiful and it was December 14th and still even now we celebrate this big
01:42:01 summer for teens when you met yeah well that's this poetry stuff but is it was the same day was to wait December 14
01:42:07 two days ago so we celebrated 46 years what is today this is you met of this day was tea and
01:42:18 poetry but like it there also guitar I think yes and when you say guitar I mean there's a bar tradition as basically
01:42:26 poetry to music yeah any kind of lyrics is really important yeah I would say it was 96 percent it was mostly lyrics and
01:42:32 guitar it was just like how did you win her over oh that's that's that what's your secret
01:42:47 what how'd you do it  actually also I became her mentor which made my life a little bit easier and you know I started
01:42:59 with poetry and I end up with science and then actually and we stay together we married three years after that do you
01:43:12 remember any poems you've written her well I'm not no not of course you never say it when I would for 30 years but at
01:43:23 that moment I would say like reciting all this life poems it's probably not the best stuff to do now it should be a
01:43:34 special discussion about that probably together with her okay what I can say that I have a couple of this book
01:43:48 booklets on poetry but it is already not the same I was already not the same it was in in high school which means at the
01:43:55 time already most of my poetry was I would say not funny but more like yeah woody playful
01:44:13 yeah yeah yeah yeah okay when did you know you will marry her when did you know that you know sort of this is this
01:44:21 is gonna be it's the one you remember this one two three yeah maybe not during first five minutes but maybe after 20
01:44:33 minutes yeah I'm gonna marry that one yeah it is very I mean she she she she is beautiful and she was even shocked
01:44:39 she was younger me too so just almost immediately but it was clear that we cannot do
01:44:47 you know immediately so we're waiting I'm not on the gorilla from master level because you know in Soviet Union it was
01:45:04 undergraduate class master it was like PhD levels just we wait until I'm done the semester when did you first learn
01:45:22 that you will be a father some four people don't know I have an older brother uglier fatter stupider blood and
01:45:30 Greg oh he's good just uglier now he's doing 1977 it's no he was born in 1978 so it was not an
01:45:51 easy moment for me I would say even very difficult moment because it was a concept in Soviet Union which is
01:46:02 difficult to to understand here the so called for a pisco it's just even not possible to translate which means that
01:46:11 you have to have a special absolutely complicated permission and normally complicated mission to live in Moscow
01:46:19 and Leningrad which is in some Petersburg now so to do that you have to either have to be born there and that's
01:46:30 it actually so it was a close series so and I was from Kiev and mom she was a she is from Malaysia so just
01:46:48 how to do that in 1976 1977 I was like the first grade of PhD first year of PhD and without this permission to live in
01:47:01 Moscow so just it was a difficult moment this is a practical thing because you want to you want to stay in Moscow
01:47:07 longer term long because yeah because in Soviet Union Moscow it was like a number one place but mostly easy times this
01:47:13 permission that's extremely complicated and because mom is originally from a different area of the Soviet Union yeah
01:47:19 and there's called as complications bureaucracy all that kind of she was born she lived in the area for first
01:47:27 uranium the most important uranium mines in Soviet Union so that's she's from wearisome so what and that's where you
01:47:41 were he was perfect yeah yeah nuclear that explains so much so how did it feel like when one greg was born means just
01:47:50 becoming a father what was that story like so yes it's a pain I was very much well obviously I was very happy but I
01:48:05 was nervous about future because future was not clear at that time not clear at all about this time my situation was
01:48:23 well it's a little bit long story but what happened that I get sick and and they did not know where to put me it was
01:48:37 infectious and and finally I end up in the house of Sahara which is interesting moment and was mixed all together with
01:48:51 Greg births with me being sick with with the sire of all together whatever it was like a vista mess it's just just a
01:49:00 stressful mess yeah and when I came to get onto this scoffs to the city and middle Asia in near now they call it urgent
01:49:13 oh so it is near her gentle well I was very happy and one of the first hour at that point I wrote my first not book but
01:49:26 chapter in the book and the walls the topic plasma chemistry plasma chemistry and topic of my chapter
01:49:35 it was synthesis of nitrogen oxide from air and there is a very famous I love it the picture of Greg on the wall when he
01:49:47 just you know a couple of weeks and he's read in the book and he's in front and he's just like so much interest and he's
01:49:53 reading this plasma chemistry book yeah it's a good picture it's a good picture right so how did it
01:49:58 feel like so obviously Greg is a disappointment so how did it feel like when I was finally born oh this you it was a it was
01:50:09 way of course way easier and we were way more happier because it was 1983 so which means that we were already in
01:50:17 Moscow we got this practice can we got this permission and we got and our apartment so just everything was
01:50:24 so nice and so beautiful and and you know cherry on top of this cake it was you and and the only funny story which
01:50:34 is like always mom she used to say is like for some reason I don't know even why but everybody were sure that you are
01:50:42 a girl and not you but like that is the girl the girl yeah and so everything was prepared for a girl and and we were
01:50:55 staying and near this clinic and me and Greg and just and it was now that it is a boy and Greg he mentioned his famous
01:51:06 friend that he's so much happy that you're a boy and you know the story also that he was five years old and he was
01:51:15 for some reason sure that to that man they make poison and women they make girls and he was so much surprising he
01:51:24 said that man she's so good it was impressed yes that she could make a boy a boy yeah yeah so that were you ready
01:51:36 to be a father would you say it you know being father it's a big commitment big big big commitment because now it's
01:51:46 a real family when Greg was born it was like oh my was a mess so it was very challenging it was very difficult
01:51:55 when you were like a fun and nice and everybody they're so happy and even if you look at pictures you know like a
01:52:02 picture with you that just yes the following is the smiling it's a happy bring joy to the world
01:52:07 yes and basically that's the way you were when they were like you were always you know you wake up you smile that's
01:52:18 good it's a good sign very good well let's go let's go so I I wanted to be a psychiatrist
01:52:25 selling me psychoanalyze you well to be honest it's not for me to judge what I am but I can tell you that
01:52:40 my whole life I just tried sometimes more successful sometimes less successful to be good dad
01:52:52 that it's not for me to judge I mean you know I can give an example like when Greg was very young for me
01:53:06 like a very important was on Dow books and I had these 10 books often Dow by the way there are now there but here
01:53:13 they're in my office and you know that's the books which I read and just I put my yeah sweat blood
01:53:23 and sweat and blood and tears right into this book and what Greg did he just took these books and he took like a this
01:53:36 flowmaster what is that like Oh markers markers markers and he everything around is like a the cover of this he drew on
01:53:47 it no he just it's like graffiti it's like it's all over this and it was how to say you know
01:54:01 for me it was not a good night is sacred I mean yeah and I was just I remember this moment I was so much not happy just
01:54:10 you know and I just try to explain and I mean and I ain't even and Greg he keeps saying even now that that he won't he he
01:54:21 was sure that he is doing something good that he's just you know that I love these books so he tried to make them
01:54:26 even you know prettier prettier yeah that's so what I'm trying to say that
01:54:35 welcome to being a dad right there yes yes yes so if you can go back and do something
01:54:40 different in terms of being a dad what well you know I would say people they're different some people they always say they want a
01:55:07 different life and they sure for some reason that if they start again it would be better it is not my case for some
01:55:16 reason I don't know maybe this is just like internal friends just to put like you mention about Fineman but I just
01:55:25 always try to protect myself and family and just I was sure like my father during the war that if I am strong
01:55:35 everything will be good but and as a result believe me or not and it's psychologically it helped me
01:55:44 psychologically significantly I really believe that I am always right which is which is strange maybe yeah but it is
01:55:53 the way to protect myself I don't know protect family so when you ask me what you would be differently nothing my
01:56:03 feeling always is that my son is the best one I always try to give it right sometimes more than necessary and
01:56:14 probably it's I'm doing that wrong but but I can not do differently I am I'm sure that I'm right it's a kind of
01:56:24 defense mechanism so you fast like so you don't you our family have done a lot to make a better life or for us for me
01:56:35 and I think I've seen you work very hard to take steps through life to do make a better life for all of us with you Chris
01:56:41 many times and there is a feeling that looks like everything is okay okay okay so while
01:56:58 creating sort of creating taking risks but creating opportunities for our family for me for my brother there was
01:57:13 to me always I felt a distance so what if I told you you felt distant to me as a father and then I never really felt
01:57:22 close to you to this day do you think that's true I don't know what I'm what I can say that I tried as much as possible
01:57:42 to be as good father as they can it's sometimes it's difficult to combine the system with this self-protection like it
01:57:53 said so that's you know so there's an interesting it could be a Russian immigrant thing it could be a Jewish
01:58:01 thing too but sort of say if you're captain of a boat or something and you see you have somebody precious your
01:58:09 family on the boat it seems that you were more focused on just making sure the boat doesn't crash or like sort of
01:58:16 focusing on or maybe getting a bigger boat or the for the fail at like there's this focus of the journey in providing
01:58:26 and stability and so on then then not actually and not sitting down and enjoying time on the boat that you've
01:58:37 built you know I have with with with a family I agree with you but it is not Russian it is not Russian it's the
01:58:46 Jewish and it's immigrants because so many times I was very nervous that one thing goes wrong and everything
01:59:00 crashes and there are the million things in our life but I am always feeling this point is the most dangerous dangerous
01:59:14 here that is okay that is okay that's that's dangerous so I feel this danger and I am overdoing this nervousness and
01:59:25 it is always with me and that's why even now at any point I am too much nervous because I see it looks like my feeling
01:59:35 is that like people they do not see that this is a deadly point like a crucial battle neck or whatever yeah and and and
01:59:43 I know that if I say that directly people it can be not good so I have to play with that in one way or another and
01:59:52 so but I would say that it's a typical for Jewish people because they went through hundreds and hundreds and
01:59:59 hundreds even a thousand years of problems and also for immigrants because that's immigrant life you remember your
02:00:11 own story was high school and the first time came there I mean there is some kind of tiny details which can make your
02:00:17 life miserable yeah middle school I mean I was a particularly interesting moment that I
02:00:26 think it's an interesting moment that I don't know how to explore correctly because we came to this country so I was
02:00:31 maybe 13 I don't even remember those middle school and it was a very different culture change it was a very
02:00:38 very very different culture and we went to a it was a it's a middle school stuff for people in general but I went from
02:00:47 having a lot of friends from culture that I loved somehow deeply is sort of this math and science and he talked
02:00:55 about this I mean there's so many French dug deep friendships to a very shallow place and sort of the difference between what
02:01:03 you know everybody I don't discount the suffering of people but I would say I suffered you know you
02:01:10 you want to be like that's stupid but I really psychologically suffered and at the same time you were sort of totally
02:01:18 unable to understand that obviously because well hold on a second I think you came to America the the step to come
02:01:23 to America is a beautiful step of opportunity so there's this the economy of like to me that was a horrible thing
02:01:31 for my own selfish personal little experience I didn't see that I didn't you know at that age you don't think
02:01:37 about the big picture of things but it's an interesting difference and the step to America is it a really interesting
02:01:45 step because you're sacrificing so much of who you are it's a big big leap big leap but it's 
02:01:55 it's the it's a good leap for the future of the family for opportunity for for building a life together and it's an
02:02:02 interesting how did you think about that process we'll talk about it a little bit it'll take a step back and talk about it
02:02:11 mores are big your family but as a dad as a family not big but let's just day-to-day how did you that move how did
02:02:21 you experience it how did you think about it well this is a moment and I can read for you a poetry unfortunately
02:02:38 again it's in Russian but I will use no no it's okay I it's only a couple of sentences I will give you from there
02:02:49 it's a beautiful very nice very Jewish poet in 1941 beginning of the war so he said catalyst Mirchi dude I used a
02:03:05 period eight emotional blockage with summit rudeness yes by you just I should Dania tacky well it's the Thunder fool
02:03:17 poem I can read the whole poem later not with the microphone but listen to that you are very nervous before but when it
02:03:27 is already attack when you are just already in action you don't think about that so this moment of coming to America the
02:03:40 first period I was not nervous I was like like a machine I was doing I was doing that so yeah I mean it's the same
02:03:53 when you decide the decision is the right one yeah you see I listen to a three I can just you know it's easy to
02:04:02 translate it like when you are going to attack you are singing yeah when you cry it's before that you have the stress the
02:04:12 anxiety the tears but when you already repair yeah you believe in your star and you go and you don't think much
02:04:23 well let me pause on this as I asked you what you know was I good son yes the better one
02:04:41 then Greg obviously but no but what what would you know without any hesitation I can say that you were and you are very
02:04:54 good son because you understand when you're talking and it was from the beginning he always even if I never kid
02:05:05 you're not kids usually they think about themselves and they see the whole world is rotating around them but you were way
02:05:15 less serious for many years you just used so people around you are able to to see okay this is this is my version
02:05:25 thesis further I mean II you just see people and that's incredible also just from the like first months of your life
02:05:40 you're laughing smiling yeah and believe me it is not so many kids are doing that which means that somewhere deeply in
02:05:49 your I don't know where its genes probably I don't know you were smiling so you know like whenever I see it's a
02:05:58 good person or not so good person take a look at the personal and this person wakes up some people they wake up and
02:06:08 the immediate is smile ultimate that's something I don't know it's like a miracle so you are okay so thank you for
02:06:15 being a good son yeah maybe I'm not so good father that's another story but well the this context makes it much more
02:06:22 important for me to criticize you it makes it impossible for you to criticize me which is exactly how I set it up okay
02:06:31 but so you mentioned the gossip as one of the people in your story Kirchhoff Institute can you tell the
02:06:39 story and your involvement in Chernobyl sort of that played a part in our lives as well so what's the story there
02:06:49 what is Chernobyl okay for people who don't know yeah Chernobyl it's a it's a small city town with a huge nuclear
02:07:04 power plant and it's a place of world ever biggest nuclear severe accident the reason of this accident the best if you
02:07:24 know Lex but other people they can watch the movie which is HBO show yeah HBO show very good actually
02:07:32 I did not expect but it is really very good oh the major reason is they just went through special tests and just
02:07:43 testing new regimes and they start to decrease activity of reactor very fast and the reactor starts dying and they
02:07:52 just increase activity and then they were unable to stop it and temperature go very high metal
02:08:01 clothing start reacting with cooling water producing hydrogen hydrogen reacts with oxygen and it was a huge hydrogen
02:08:11 explosion the so-called DDT and because of this explosion actually a very very very very heavy like a tip of the
02:08:23 reactor jump up low down and forty tones or something like that I froze huge just then destroy the whole
02:08:32 reactor and all this nuclear fuel start falling down create some critical mass and it was nuclear explosion but not
02:08:44 contained so yes it was what part of the story did the show get right and what part of story did you get wrong any of
02:08:51 you would be gossips just things you've experienced a person so I just very shortly described what happened yes that
02:09:00 like it was this kind of already nuclear expansion and everything from inside was boom went out and actually with the wind
02:09:11 make almost a half circle around the world so that's accident for instead of atomic energy it was a very big deal because
02:09:26 the whole community the whole country actually they consider that this huge Institute is responsible for this
02:09:38 accident so the reaction don't forget it's a communist country they decided it's like like an army that all people
02:09:49 all scientists they are responsible dust matter whatever if you do in plasma or you're doing nuclear reactor does matter
02:09:56 you have to go and help you want it you don't want it you like it you don't like it in the movie it was shown but I would
02:10:13 right absolutely it's unbelievable how good they made this nice they made this movie there
02:10:21 from the people the culture the science every single interaction the bureaucracy yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:10:26 they did not overdo that because it's very easy to go like it's a communist country that's why and vice-versa so
02:10:34 they did it the very good harmony is very good balance yeah that was perfect were they wrong here at
02:10:42 least my impression is that they show the apartment of Lagasse's the gossip was actually almost the copy of real
02:10:52 digas visually - yes yes yes yes as this actor he looks like legal and just you know Wow just like as a good actor
02:10:59 actually it's a good actor British you know and that's but it was shown that's like a little bit of already American
02:11:09 propaganda they show this leg Asif living in like a small apartment like a smoking cigarettes all right no come on
02:11:24 it was can you imagine like a vice president of Academy of Sciences vice president if he leaves an apartment
02:11:31 commercially in the Soviet Union where that position means you get you get handed given out the apartment he lead
02:11:37 no not an apartment it was like a special house belonging to him it is like a next door to the Institute it
02:11:47 this house did not belong to him yeah but that's where he lived so just he lived like an you know Castle and like
02:11:58 the movie it was what's your memory of him have you know you know madam come on he's my supervisor so like ok so it's
02:12:09 like a heavy it's like it like Marcia for you yeah like I had like a serif and like for you it was severe and like
02:12:18 lagarza for me it's like a motion cam so did have chance to see more should come yeah is he or laughing it's like the
02:12:25 other day every day my feeling is he was very good in nuclear chemistry he was he was a member
02:12:41 and very significant member of Communist Party the difference was Roseanna Roseanna was not very much liking
02:12:51 Communist Party well the gossip he was so he was a secretary of communist party
02:12:59 organization of crucial Institute for a couple of years so this kind of personality so he was a great scientist
02:13:08 very interesting very bright but at the same time he was a communist and he kind of believed in this communist ideas and
02:13:20 he took all that responsibility very close to his heart and that's exactly like it is shown in the movie especially
02:13:32 when the director of the Chernobyl station made a incredibly strange mistake because the wrecker was already destroyed
02:13:46 you remember my explanation but what they see the temperature is going up and his decision was you know you're an
02:13:56 artificial intelligence not so much in physics and chemistry but if temperature is going up what people will do if they
02:14:01 are not professionals let's put water there and he made the decision to put an enormous amount of
02:14:10 water into the rector to cool it down but people they took him come on I guess we have seen couple of seconds ago there
02:14:18 is no reactor there is nothing to cool down because it's now can we mention this huge temperature and you put water
02:14:26 into this huge temperature and metals metals immediately react with water producing hydrogen so actually what they
02:14:43 did it's it's it's it's extremely bad and it's nicely shown in the movie they made the decision for three people to go
02:14:55 inside under director and open the valve to let this hot water to let this water out and these people they did it
02:15:04 obviously it was clear that they were going today do you think the accident could have been avoided the Chernobyl
02:15:13 accident you know it's so deeply interlinked just Soviet culture they know why no you know how to say is it
02:15:25 possible to be sure that it will be no fire in the city it is it's very low probability it's a sexual incidence it's
02:15:34 a couple of stuff with extremely low probability happened at the same time but it was really important stuff
02:15:43 Chernobyl happened first of all because it was no automatic system of control it was impossible if they say already
02:15:52 accident there is no automatic system to stop it oh why because it's a huge reactor very heavy very very very heavy
02:16:02 in big way bigger than reactors which we have here in the United States so this is a more difficult to control so I
02:16:13 would say it was clear for many people that sooner or later it will be this accident and actually it is a copy of
02:16:22 accident which happened in America and try my Island it's very similar but American accident was more
02:16:33 better controlled so it was not so huge l still see their excellent well the gossip he took the stuff very
02:16:39 close to his heart and and it is very nicely shown in the movie and actually that's why he suicide
02:16:51 he took his own life here yeah and by the way he tried twice first time not successful a second one so there's a
02:16:59 there's a journey of suffering there afterwards he he he took you know he were the burden of credit for that the
02:17:11 responsibility and yes because actually he was claiming that these reactors are the safest in the world yeah and they
02:17:22 are but the they're way more resistive to small accidents right but they have this tiny chance of severe accident even
02:17:32 now a lot of these records are still the same are still the same and still around okay let's get into the fun can you tell
02:17:46 me what is plasma the simple explanation would be like the plasma it is what we have in fluorescent lamps if you look
02:17:58 around in your own it is something you have in all kind of sources like a most of monitors TV screens etc significant
02:18:09 number of them let's plays most plasma plasma is ionized gas what does it mean like we have gas around us and let's say
02:18:19 with electric field electrons are separated from ions so yes you take electron out of molecule so molecule
02:18:28 becomes positive ion and electron is separate with an iron iron it's if you take if take an atom or molecule and
02:18:38 take one electron out would stay there so iron it is like a atom or molecule after the saraburi
02:18:48 when they lost an electron and what's interesting about anion okay very second probably going to apply electric field
02:18:57 whoever is lighter take energy immediately energized very fast so I ins they stay regularly usually they stay
02:19:09 cold because they are heavy they are not very much moving so they are stay cold while electrons are energized almost
02:19:17 immediately yeah and their temperature in most of plasmas whatever you do electron temperature is usually on
02:19:28 ballpark it's about ten fifteen thousand Kelvin or Celsius which means twenty thirty thousand Fahrenheit hot so
02:19:37 electrons are very very very very very hot and ions like gas they're usually in most cases they're cold so if I take
02:19:49 like a cell phone and touch the screen well inside you have where you often have electrons with the temperature 20
02:19:58 30,000 Fahrenheit but you cannot feel it why because it's a one electron per million of molecules it's not so many of
02:20:10 them it's like let's say Syria Philadelphia do we have billionaires in the city of Philadelphia maybe 100 but
02:20:22 it's but it's not so much easy to meet them on the street because it's only one or two for a huge city so the same story
02:20:30 here so plasma it is very energized electrons and usually relatively cold gas but these electrons they can do a
02:20:37 lot like these billionaires in Philadelphia few have like a couple of these billionaires they can do a lot
02:20:43 it's only two of them but actually they can influence life in the city more than air itself
02:20:50 because they have abilities the same story there so electrons depending on gas they are able to create very active
02:20:58 species so they can be used as a source of light like a fluorescent lamps and they can be used to three different
02:21:08 materials so most of synthetic well I would say 100% of synthetic materials they are treated before coloring because
02:21:21 like you have a nice black tie but how to make tag black if it is synthetic if it is natural is solid real but if it is
02:21:31 synthetic material and if you try you know paint synthetic material you know pain does not stick to it
02:21:40 so you plasma treat it this electron will activate the surface and colors they start sticking to the surface what
02:21:48 is me to activate a surface so there's a lot of plasma is interacting somehow of the surface well this human skin yeah
02:21:55 some kind of surface so what does it mean to treat a surface okay try it station but it's you know if you have
02:22:04 polymer like in the case of your tie if I would like a polymer what what this electron does is just create or H and
02:22:14 this 4-h take hydrogen out of your tie and this is a opening bond and usually oxygen stick to there and become polar
02:22:23 so you cover the surface with the polar groups which are always sticky so that's what is going on you just take one atom
02:22:35 out you have free bound oxygen there polar groups here stick you can paint if if you put a droplet droplets of whiskey
02:22:49 on the suffer of glass it will stay like a droplets but if you just plasma treat this glass and then you put drop the
02:22:58 drop leg loops immediately cover very significant area okay so let's let's step back a little bit
02:23:06 so there's solid liquid gas he said yeah it's ionized gas why is plasma sometimes called the fourth state of matter so
02:23:14 what's the difference between gas and ionized gas mm-hmm such that it's a fundamental difference it is a
02:23:25 fundamental difference because like what is going on that this ionized gas immediately has very different behavior
02:23:42 just because of similarity with blood plasma so like you asked the difference between plasma and gas it is about the
02:23:49 same difference like difference between water and blood so species inside a blood they're very
02:24:01 much interacting with each other while water they're not much interacting so why here wing length mirror in 1930 436
02:24:13 he started using the word plasma versus ionized gas because he said take a look take a look take a look this species
02:24:20 they interact with each other and another so there's there's echoes connections to inspiration from blood
02:24:26 plasma yes and the degrees of the interactivity more than that so the the guy who just Nobel Prize laureate
02:24:33 earring lender was at first for analyzed by the interaction plasma search on the surface so you can say that he's like a
02:24:41 father of modern electronics hardware so he come up with this world take a look this plasma is kind of funny it looks
02:24:50 like a blood plasma and people they start like using this phrase like a joke then you know like it was really like it
02:24:58 stuck oh that's really interesting okay so you said electrons really hot so so traditionally plasma is supposed to
02:25:10 be very high-energy very hot mm-hmm so he said train its electrons but there's a hot plasma and cold plasma
02:25:21 so we'll 244 okay in hot plasma everything is hot so if you have more electrons and they are able to heat up
02:25:28 the whole gas it's a hot plasma like solar plasma the Sun or Sun solar plasma Sun 
02:25:38 and in this case temperature is very high fusion plasmas so just everything is very hot in most of engineering
02:25:46 plasmas today including your cell phones including fluorescent lamps etcetera etcetera or in these case only electrons
02:25:57 are there huts and they are unable to heat up everybody it's like this couple of billionaires in the city of
02:26:07 middle-class people and but these electrons there if it is air for example they just electrons they react with
02:26:17 oxygen making atomic oxygen atomic oxygen immediately produce ozone so atomic oxygen sticks - OH - creating OHS
02:26:23 oh by the way ozone means I think in Latin means smell so the name of the guy who first saw
02:26:35 that it was Siemens if you remember company Siemens so that's the creator of this company because he was the first
02:26:42 one to understand this ozone and said wow it smells then he they use like a legend or third
02:26:49 word for that it was on and they start using ozone for water cleaning right so what's hot plasma and what's cold plasma
02:26:59 she said in the cold plasma the electrons like the billionaire's is the only thing that stays hot so what
02:27:06 hospital asthma everybody be on earth and so in terms of applications in terms of the theoretical physics under
02:27:14 underpinning what's the difference between hot plasma and cold plasma there's entire groups of researchers
02:27:26 that work on that yes yes you know the fundamental difference is when everything is 10,000 degrees what we can
02:27:36 do with this material with this plasma it's like everything is ten thousand like a ten thousand Kelvin like a twenty
02:27:43 thousand Fahrenheit what you can do I mean that stuff melts everything and convert everything into vapor when so
02:27:52 scientifically it's very easier because it's like as close to thermodynamic equilibrium so just very very very hot
02:28:04 substance one is hella many applications applications the major application is if you wanna melt something which require
02:28:15 temperature above yeah 2,000 Celsius which is what the Isis torches so if you want if you want a hot metal metal you
02:28:26 can actually you can cut metal with most of metals they are just you know they melt it on the level of below 2000 so
02:28:35 for these metals with some exceptions but for these metals fire you know combustion torches there
02:28:46 okay now if you want to melt something which is impossible to melt like a special hard ceramics
02:28:54 if you cannot melt it with anything first of all why do you need it why do you need melt something which is
02:29:00 impossible to Makaha if you let's say if you want to protect your airplane your airplane it's a good idea to cover
02:29:09 airplane with a thin layer of a substance which is impossible to to melt which is not afraid of anything not
02:29:17 afraid of lightning not afraid of anything how to do that you have to melt we have to cover it with this material
02:29:25 but to cover we have to melt it now how to melt something which is impossible to weld well you have to take plasma so plasma
02:29:32 goes hot flash thermal plasma goes to this huge temperature then you put this powder you melt it and you spray
02:29:38 what's thermal plasma that's the heart kind of that's a high temperature plasma okay so what's cold plasma then and what
02:29:46 kind of temperatures are we talking about what's this world in terms of applications and theory thence now
02:29:51 fundamentally different from the heart a kind cold plasma it is even it's it's situation when you have electrons only
02:30:00 electrons are hot and they generate a lot of active species radicals atoms so they can treat different materials they
02:30:08 can make very sophisticated structures but temperature is low so you do not damage so let's say jumping for special
02:30:18 intelligence if you are talking about computer how to make computer how to make this wafers how to make these chips
02:30:28 yeah you have to be able to dig tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny ditches how to do that you have to have you cannot use
02:30:37 mechanical devices so you have to have something different beams lasers no because laser is heating its temperature
02:30:46 but you cannot take if you just use laser you go to temperature eternal thousand degrees you will damage
02:30:53 phone cannot withstand this temperature yes the same computer so that's why there is no alternative today only cold
02:31:04 plasma to make I would say vast majority of electronics devices so hardware it's almost you say hardware it is that so
02:31:16 let me beautifully put what's now you said application we'll talk about some applications including
02:31:24 plasma medicine but from a if we if you put on your theoretical physicist or chemist like fundamental science higher
02:31:32 what are the interesting problems in plasma mysteries they're not yet understood or things that have been
02:31:40 recently understood I've seen you talk about incredible applications but let's step let's not cover that first is there
02:31:47 some open problems how was it understood from a theoretical perspective I can give you a couple of
02:31:53 examples it's a lot of mysteries a lot why because it is strongly non equilibrium medium almost every cells
02:32:01 which we have around us it's an equilibrium what what does I mean what does it mean for a medium to be an
02:32:07 equilibrium equilibrium means it has temperature has temperature yeah some temperature like this is let say room
02:32:16 temperature well no I mean what you mean by that is there's a uniformity to it uniformity in temperature not space
02:32:25 uniformity but homogeneity like it's near if temperature now can you imagine something which has a couple of
02:32:34 different temperatures at the same point as it possible yeah that's what it is so electrons are very hot but they are
02:32:44 inside of gas and gas is cold like like people they are swimming in the ocean so temperature of a person is higher but
02:32:51 here just temperatures way way way here now what starts happening in this case it's a lot of
02:32:58 finding miracles a lot of funny miracles for example electron impact creates excitation of molecules to molecule a
02:33:11 stylus oscillate and people will learn that distribution this becomes very strange energy rich molecules they they
02:33:25 take more energy when they have already something and okay rich people they become richer and poor people then
02:33:33 becomes more poor exactly the same thing they call it capitalism in molecular life happens in plasma so what is going on
02:33:45 you take molecules in plasma excite and very fast against all the rules of whatever nature couple of molecules they
02:33:54 have to quantum and they have more and more and more and more than normal and very soon make some molecules they have
02:34:01 everything and most of molecules have nothing as a result if you have this kind of non equilibrium immediately
02:34:09 creates lasers so this is one of the reason why lasers first offers lasers they were created in plasma even now the
02:34:17 most energetic like co2 laser except plasma lasers and there's also plasma laser plasma it's very accelerated
02:34:25 application but physics is here I can explain it's a little bit longer how it works but it's very similar to what is
02:34:31 going on with people if you already have money it's easier for you to attract new money if you are actually poor sooner or
02:34:40 later you will lose your money in the favour of rich people not sure how well the analogy works but probably but
02:34:45 they're saying that there's some fascinating complicated instability about that hole but it's interesting
02:34:52 it's interesting instability its instability not space instability its energy instability here
02:35:00 it's like a yes you said capitalism capitalism at the molecular level it's a capitalism it's a like a wild
02:35:08 capitalism yeah where just everything works against the middle class who's the Bernie Sanders in this physics analogy
02:35:14 I'm just kidding that's a who's the social oh okay and I don't know let's not take this analogy that's interesting
02:35:22 that you know that plasma works works against Bernie Sanders so nature nature yeah nature's as a is a more Republican
02:35:33 it's a more of a public nature is Republican well no not nature at in plasma Nanakuli it's only non
02:35:38 equilibrium class non-equilibrium plasma equilibrium plasma it's everything it's very much Bernie Sanders it's very much
02:35:45 harness distribution yeah well non equilibrium plasmas let's live a short life and die quickly so yes
02:35:54 so if you want a long peaceful existence you want to go that's one of the reasons why will these Bernie Sanders in visit
02:36:01 that's very interesting that but for this reason non-equilibrium plasma cold plasma is able to produce way more
02:36:12 miracles as miracles meaning very interesting strange errand rapturous patterns treatment like you cannot use
02:36:21 hot plasma to make electronic device well you can do it it's just one example another example is like a recently I
02:36:29 came yesterday well yeah yesterday from Japan so we presented ionization of liquids not gases so it's a lot of
02:36:38 interesting new stuff Oh liquids very interesting yeah so you've mentioned physics in chemistry what is plasma
02:36:47 physics what is plasma chemistry in terms of application in terms of theory what are the different lenses of physics
02:36:55 and chemistry that you used to explore plasma and how do they differ you have books on each yes
02:37:03 the simplest I think that it was fine one who was asked what is physics and I think it's him
02:37:11 and after some thinking he said well that's what physicists do yeah so that's a good point so actually it's a nice way
02:37:26 to say that's a stupid question but it gives the question of more of a chance so what's the difference between plasma
02:37:33 physics does McGuinness in even physics and chemistry more broadly and can I mean I don't know what's the more easier
02:37:44 distinction to draw yeah I can compare with languages like what's the difference between English language and
02:37:51 Chinese language in one case you have how many I forgot 23 or whatever characters how many well yeah it was
02:38:00 five okay something-something twenties yeah and in Japanese Oh in the Chinese you have ten thousand forty thousand
02:38:12 characters so Chinese it's chemistry English it's physics physics has small number of rules and laws of nature and
02:38:24 operates with that so understanding let's say how to ionize gas it's physics understanding how to create plasma in
02:38:33 liquid it's physics understanding how to make a device how to make a light source plasma light source it's physics now
02:38:42 when we are coming to Chinese I'll I mean to this chemistry it means that there is a million different tables not
02:38:50 rules tables yes it's tables instead of rules and so what's not going on you just look at that and see oh my gosh
02:38:57 this glass my special another equilibrium plasma creates thousands of species and we have to understand what
02:39:04 kind of species and sometimes you need these species but you don't need these species so how to have more of that and
02:39:10 I would have less of these there is no rules well there are some rules but about as much as in create
02:39:19 creating Chinese characters so a lot of it is a lot of the knowledge in plasma chemistry is discovered through
02:39:26 experimentation yeah and I would say chemistry is more art physics is a little bit more science like linguistics
02:39:35 you know English language it's possible that's also a lot of challenges but it's simple well talking about simple and
02:39:43 complicated going from physics to chemistry let's go to biology one of the exciting feels that you're one of the
02:39:52 founders of his plasma medicine what is plasma medicine ok cold plasma cold plasma creates a lot of species
02:40:02 interesting species unexpected species you remember this capitalism in molecular life you can a little bit
02:40:07 change parameters and it can be wrong look I start generating this strange substance it's a twisted so plasma is
02:40:15 very sensitive the difference is like a human body and asthma generates very interesting active species actually to
02:40:25 be honest almost exactly the same so professor David graves he keeps saying that he was impressed and he looked you
02:40:34 know books of medical biology books and he said like a species active species inside of human body and in Copeland's
02:40:41 they're the same so plasma create is very interesting stuff and it was clear for people from the beginning like
02:40:51 already for more than hundred years that if you put plasma in contact with human body you can treat some diseases you can do a
02:41:00 lot of stuff the problem was that if plasma is energetic and you put this energetic plasma in contact with human
02:41:11 body you kill the person so actually the whole point the whole interesting point of plasma medicine so plasma medicine
02:41:19 came from physicists actually where it become possible to make uniform not damaging very energetic plasmas example
02:41:32 at atmospheric pressure example we have atmospheric pressure around atmosphere and there is a lightning lightning is
02:41:45 hot and very energetic and very damaging plasma sources plasma discharges like lightning it's impossible to use to
02:41:55 treat human body you'll just throw a lot of this fry fry do you kill the competition yeah now what happened like
02:42:04 when 16 years ago it was the first time when physicists to learn how to make lightning not like
02:42:16 concentrated in a tiny channel to be diffused and just around a big big big big area like to make it something like
02:42:28 a aurora borealis from lightning and it was actually in 1990s a lot of like efforts it was a French approach they
02:42:41 just etc but finally we won because what we it was like a out-of-the-box solution to make extremely short electric paths
02:42:52 short especially or temporarily in time time in time so let's say because we have when we have lightning between
02:43:02 clouds and ground it's like a continuous voltage but if we apply this voltage between skies and
02:43:13 ground let's say couple of nanoseconds there is no time to create the Lightning Channel just simply no time so what is going on
02:43:23 you start creating something like aurora borealis so you have a glowing everywhere because there is no time to
02:43:30 create a channel so you make this pulse and then you stop yes and then you repeat this pulse again then you stop
02:43:39 and you repeat this pulse again so through this not a second passing it impossible to create a uniform class and
02:43:49 if plasma is uniform it's not damaging aurora borealis you will not kill anybody with lightning you will so that
02:43:58 allows you not damaging to now start allowing plasma to interact with the human body somehow so treating tissues
02:44:04 for example yes why is that interesting what yeah what kind of applications are we talking about okay today the biggest
02:44:14 application is related to treatment of chronic wounds like our source especially diabetic ulcers also recently
02:44:27 treatment of cancers because our plasma sources are permitted to be used during surgeries so when like a surgeon is
02:44:38 making surgery he removes cancer but some margins are not treated so they start using this plasma just to remove
02:44:49 tissue bad tissue without damage because it is instead of like a scalpel it's like a jet small jet for wounds it's a
02:45:01 very effective generation of the stimulation of angiogenesis so just drawing all blood vessels
02:45:09 so that's I would say two most successful applications today what plasma related Nobel Prizes do you think
02:45:16 will be given in the next 50 years so if you look at at the big ideas in plasma what do you think is there to be
02:45:27 discovered understood or may have already been understood and and will be recognized for it okay
02:45:38 closer to our field at least where we are playing and if we are fielders our I would say cold plasma for magical
02:45:48 biological applications I would say if there is a significant actually accepted by FDA etc success and treatment of
02:45:59 cancer there is a big chance to get Nobel Prize what discipline would you get it will be medicine in medicine
02:46:05 that's fascinating that's fascinating it is this another example which I like a lot personally it
02:46:17 is this plasma ionization of liquids without bubbles that's the chance so to get Nobel Prize for that because its
02:46:28 first of all it's a fascinating physics ionization of liquids are bubbles what's the niche of the bubbles that form if
02:46:38 you take liquid and put like a two electrodes in the liquid to ionize liquids you need a huge electric field
02:46:48 at least that's what most people they used to think because mean free path is small so electrons they they have to be
02:46:56 accelerated to have this huge energy so it's either electric field is huge or there is enough distance just route
02:47:03 to accelerate now if you have liquid that's no much place to to go so you have to have about a thousand times
02:47:12 greater electric field or you have to create some voids if you create voids and send of liquor that's okay
02:47:20 now that's what people that you still believe but maybe about five seven years ago people they understood that even
02:47:30 when they have very high electric bill ionization of liquid so just the same as plasma in fluorescent lamps but you have
02:47:46 the same thing in liquid and first one's very interesting physics is a longer story to explain that's very interesting
02:47:51 physics but also that interest application because you have possibility to have cold plasma inside of liquid so
02:48:00 you can synthesize new materials you can do something so that was the reason like I came a couple of yesterday making this
02:48:10 presentation of these discharges and creation of this in the initial creation of polymeric nitrogen because people
02:48:20 they don't have nitrogen polymers today and that's in cold plasma it was synthesized so it is very interesting
02:48:28 from fundamental point of view of synthetic chemistry but nobody were able to make like this kind of change from
02:48:35 nitrogen right so that was created it's very interesting now this material at normal conditions is converted back to
02:48:46 regular nitrogen releasing huge energy way more than any explosive materials so okay so those are two interesting ideas
02:48:55 yeah close close to your heart what about what about the Sun what about hot thermal plasma do you think there's an
02:49:01 interesting open problems there that will help us understand the universe or something like that I don't think so
02:49:07 today there is no I think for for thermal plasma there is very low chances for Nobel Prize kind of results however
02:49:16 there is a so called fusion plasmas so plasmas because the thermal plasma which we discuss it's it's thermal engineering
02:49:22 plasmas it's it's plasmas like melting welding these kind of applications coatings and
02:49:32 surface of the Sun surface of the Sun but if you go to higher temperatures you have fuel nuclear fusion but if in
02:49:43 normal plasma thermal plasma temperature is about ten thousand Kelvin ten thousand for fusion you have to have 100
02:49:52 million so it's more Wow so inside the Sun it's a deeply inside and the physics there is interesting
02:50:01 physics is extremely interesting because it's a lot of questions with stability and this plasma this kind of temperature
02:50:10 you behave very different so it is it is I would say super fluidic material so it's just it's it's do you think there's
02:50:21 possible breakthroughs in terms of using fusion as an energy source or somehow in you know that kind of like a crazy ideas
02:50:30 were out there ideas but on this podcast I talk to people about aliens and traveling across the universal if you
02:50:36 want to travel across the universe you're gonna have to write healing is that my feeling is that like a fusion
02:50:46 plasma in its traditional way which was started in my Sahara in 1953 almost no chances well I mean they have it they
02:51:01 have it already but the system is so complicated this tokamaks this big eater become tokamak is so complicated so difficult
02:51:11 that personally it's difficult for me to believe that it will be like a real energy generating plant so this is being
02:51:20 up to control fusion in order to leverage if yeah hey just say try already for how many years of oxygen
02:51:28 that's an interesting point that's what I'm trying to say let I am almost sure that at some point
02:51:40 hopefully soon it will be young I'm not very much young but usually young out-of-the-box thinking person who will
02:51:48 say guys take a look I did it something like envision some Thai confusion you know there's a lot of guys
02:51:55 and girls like that who are called crazy who've been talking about cold fusion for decades
02:52:00 yeah so you think you hope that there is a breakthrough idea that my lease yes hey I'm almost sure about that and I
02:52:09 can't explain you simple physics if it's forty seconds thirty side it one and take longer put okay don't try me
02:52:19 take a look take a look what is fusion you take the etherium three two or the state of the cerium you bring them
02:52:26 together and they fuse and you they release energy that's it right the problem is that this is iron this design
02:52:34 they're positively charged and we have to bring them extremely close and energy required for that is 10 10 100 million
02:52:44 degrees that's what they try to do now now take a look why we have to bring them so much close we can bring them a
02:52:55 little bit and it will be tunneling so they will start tracking it require more time yes but that's okay but to do that
02:53:03 you have to have three smaller sizes you have to have dense matter maybe 30 40 50 times denser than what we have now how
02:53:15 to do that you have to replace electron by something very similar to electron but heavier ions if you do that
02:53:25 immediately substance becomes smaller and you start having cold normal fusion but like a production and reproduction
02:53:34 of this material it's kind of complicated people there try what I'm trying to say that somebody will come up
02:53:41 with an interesting out the box solution that's what I believe well you're right a lot of people
02:53:48 they're a little bit I would say not professionally just think oh look I did it but but between these people or
02:53:56 between serious scientists thinking out of the box Samson will happen tokamaks yes they
02:54:02 work but there's so much complicated it's very difficult to keep 100 million degrees for isn't a long time just very
02:54:13 difficult beautiful unless whatever will do that Nobel Prize without any question okay the way okay refill refill you soon
02:54:31 baby shoes never do it okay we talked about coming to here's to you okay doing good three hours in we talked about the
02:54:40 journey to America a little bit but let's take a step back it seems like an unlikely journey that has to do with a
02:54:50 bunch of different factors ideas hopes and dreams and goals and plans why did we move to America as a family can you
02:54:59 tell the story there narrowly and broadly as our big family that's a lot of details out of like a interesting
02:55:11 stuff which happened at the same time together first of all I was already in France most of time which made situation
02:55:22 easier to go to America but absolutely significant role was played by captain's family what is the Caplan's family yeah
02:55:34 it is our last name is Friedman yes taking attention yeah what's good Kaplan four of your grand grandmother yours my
02:55:52 grandmother my great grandmother your great-grandmother so her name was Kelly rich and when her family came in America they changed name
02:56:03 to Kaplan's and it was forbidden to contact family during an early period you need to reach outside the country
02:56:11 Soviet Union to which so there's this big family well not that I'm not big but now big Kaplan family they came to yes
02:56:20 yeah and my father he your grandfather had this interesting picture and without much hopes he wrote a letter without
02:56:33 speaking English and you saw this everywhere it is said like a Jew newspaper and the word Jew was G spot on
02:56:47 g g e-- w yeah newspapers Cincinnati lit it America and we got to his destination and that's like a miracle
02:56:56 yeah that the letter came to this direction it's interesting because the newspaper published the letter yeah
02:57:03 that's  it's it's kind of America and that yeah it's a it's a miracle so that's started the miracle they gave
02:57:11 a catalyst that was a catalyst yeah it was an action and just as a result you know we met and just an it was a
02:57:20 catalyst for me to accept the position already for friends position of a full professor in University of Illinois and
02:57:30 Chicago and that's actually how we moved to Chicago so did you ever think that you would come to America honestly no
02:57:41 even with my good friends we were usually talking and my plans when I understand that it's better for a
02:57:49 scientist to go like outside of South Soviet Union Europe Daniel dos tres and my choice was
02:57:58 clearly friends and we usually say that I spoke with Boris Potemkin that I always say that I will go to France
02:58:06 I said well and I want to go to South America Oh but actually heaven all the way opposites oh yes okay
02:58:17 I spoke way better French language yeah and I started a new French taking French that there was there was a there was an
02:58:24 alternate reality where we moved to France and I'm French yeah and you're French and chances for
02:58:32 death were very high fifty-fifty kind of thing I mean I remember there being is pretty certain that we're going to France
02:58:41 yeah it was more than 50% yeah because we have already I mean it was very very high chance yeah you remember the
02:58:48 picture I show you over there with me or with French people without been shooting off ski few no remember I just forever
02:58:54 remember like I'll mention I have ski he loves you he useful oh he's a lobbyist yeah yeah and he plays very nice piano
02:59:04 yeah it's a very very nice people and there's a different world of scientists a different perhaps more pure in their
02:59:15 pursuit of science a more support for the kind of labs and the spirit of the scientific process it's  America's
02:59:22 academic research system is a little bit more capitalistic I guess an American professor spends about 50 percent of
02:59:31 time looking for funding and they're a little bit more independent meaning their own little startup more it's very
02:59:38 difficult to do an institute and so on speaking of which I don't know how I forgot to mention but the Institute
02:59:48 you're you've headed the Drexel than I am plasma Institute for a long time from 2002 from 2002 what was that journey
03:00:00 like of all the many brilliant people that have worked there through the years all the different ideas
03:00:06 having an institute in America is an interesting thing in itself yes all the other what's that journey been like wow
03:00:15 it was very exciting and very challenging and I would say that I work very hard but I would say I was very
03:00:28 much lucky that I was able to bring who is me a nice group of people with Nestor good Sal poor chef and more recently
03:00:44 ordinary chant and then he'll the bring in a lot now and in others so it was a lot of people and they were good and it
03:00:58 was a very nice feeling of how to say camaraderie camaraderie yeah in a living including Greg who made a huge
03:01:08 contribution to that Norma's so it is like it's my brother yep and I've been on the outside of that sort of looking
03:01:15 in so I know a lot of these people they're good and either stick or they're almost like a part of family I know
03:01:20 they're part of our story in America really yeah I know the yeah and we have a handsome and to remember of my time
03:01:29 plus miniseries yeah yeah yeah low head don't be shy no no no fear no fear yeah don't be shy go head NPI and P I'd you
03:01:42 write that yeah you know eighth grade your poetry has been going down downhill and me we talked about that a lot that
03:01:50 writing poetry English like she's much more difficult it's it's a and hence why it's not as popular it's it's not more
03:01:59 popular gifts through in music through hip hop through rap that's the popular kind of poetic writing is in America
03:02:09 basically in France it is very closer to Russia the French language allows  yeah French language allows for at least like
03:02:23 song oriented poetry what would you say is the difference between the Soviet Union in America that kind of maybe to
03:02:33 ask it another way what do you miss about the Soviet Union about Russia about Ukraine you see that while me and
03:02:47 other people which came in our generation which came from Russia Ukraine Soviet Union we just we were not
03:02:56 happy absolutely not happy with the political system over there but I would say without an exception we are all I
03:03:06 would say deeply in love with Russian culture which is absolutely unique and absolutely beautiful and my and my
03:03:19 feeling that while I like American culture also but a rationalist way closer to my heart and I think it's way
03:03:29 richer the same thing is approach to science which in Russia was very let's first of all I like it because I was
03:03:37 younger which is always nice to be young but you know this kind of feeling of science is more important than
03:03:49 everything else and being a professor it is the most prestigious profession that's kind of interesting culture but
03:04:03 but the political system was not good and nice now it's also challenging but with my Boonton insurgent of Putin came
03:04:18 to power after we left yeah to sound here mm exactly you remember this moment when we were in Miami Beach
03:04:27 New Year's New Year it was exactly the day when putting the came a president because absolutely unexpectedly one day
03:04:37 before that it was like a New Year greeting from a president at that time Boris Yeltsin and he said
03:04:45 happy holidays Happy New Year guys and you know what I decided to step down oops and just I wanna another person to lead
03:04:55 the country different transition periods and then we have elections so that's day so we talk and I in different ways also
03:05:03 love certain parts of Russia and there's still a part of me even though it's I didn't spend there more than 13 years or whatever
03:05:12 but Putin represents modern Russia so that's why I asked if it's you know we're we're Americans now really but
03:05:19 what do you think about this man who's caring who's defining the 21st century Russia I would say there is a to phrases
03:05:30 to sayings which come into my mind you see you gave me 10 seconds to think which is important there is a saying the
03:05:41 end justifies the means you know who said that it's a there is a book here it's a it's a Machiavelli oh this is by
03:05:50 the way his sculpture well so the the head yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know but straight I said Machiavelli in the book prince he
03:06:02 said that the ends justifies dreams another phrase it's another nice guy maximilien robespierre he used to say
03:06:14 you cannot make an omelet without on a papaya they have them let the Sun Casa deserve yeah that's a Robespierre
03:06:27 and these two phrases actually they describe for me at least Putin you know that his way of thinking is it was a
03:06:42 huge jerk catastrophe because think for a second huge Soviet Union were Russians they were everywhere
03:06:49 - people Russian Russian and in during a short period of time boons it is a 15 independent countries
03:07:00 what the hell and and like significant I don't know I would say almost half okay a lesson help but very significant
03:07:09 number of Russians they become like his people living in other countries not very much friendly to Russia so he put
03:07:21 all his efforts to change it to to make it easier and better that and this is the ends which justifies means and he is
03:07:37 breaking a lot of eggs and he's making a lot of not good steps but for the good purpose now just what I keep thinking
03:07:48 that Russian Empire it is a not first Empire to disappear now take a look what happened to other empires French Empire
03:07:59 oh my gosh they had enormous lis problems very similar to Putin and you know who was there Putin it was the goal
03:08:10 because in late 1950s it was an enormous war in Algeria and the whole group of Maghreb countries and you know what
03:08:19 happened they just even stopped the Republic and they create absolutely new constitution and it was actually
03:08:30 absolute disaster in late 1950s early 1960s but they actually went out faster than Russia
03:08:39 well why it's a different story now take a look another huge the biggest empire in the world it's a British they lost
03:08:50 their empire and huge number of British people they just stay somewhere the same thing like Soviet Union but interesting
03:09:01 enough they they they made it they made like this other countries which get rid of British Empire but they were still in
03:09:13 love with the Queen they become part of this Commonwealth and it was relatively smooth so British they did excellent job
03:09:29 French like always you know yeah yeah tariffs but Russia so far doing not good so they are just they they try to
03:09:41 help they try to make this kind of but they break a lot of eggs should I interview Putin on his podcast piece is
03:09:52 a very interesting personality he's very smart and try but sure but what you want to talk about because power future of
03:10:13 Russia future of Russia and is great and it's right no no no not not doing not in those kinds of questions
03:10:23 but in the kind of omelet and eggs way and in the space of technology sort of innovation of science of becoming a
03:10:36 superpower again which is where you have to you know the space race he will like this kind of discussion because what I
03:10:46 know about him by the way he supports the platform Edison little asthma medicine yes because when he defined
03:10:53 like a three or whatever four major directions of development of science he mentioned those are the three owners and
03:11:04 plasma medicine yeah okay interesting he really thinks that the ends justifies the means
03:11:19 so he is not afraid to make any kind of decision but to make country stronger and and he did actually he did a very
03:11:35 good job from the word review of you know all other republics they were saying that I have all our problems is
03:11:42 because of freshmen but what Russia can say if all these problems because of yeah he took responsibility but with
03:11:52 power authoritarians power can is very useful but it can also cloud your judgment you can slowly become a lesser
03:11:58 man that you could have otherwise been without being checked so doing the complicated instantaneous it's a
03:12:06 complicated interesting story so you can compare him with maximilien robespierre so without a microphone between us we
03:12:14 often talk about artificial intelligence you have a lot of opinions like you said you're always think you're right and
03:12:23 you're right you know yeah barely half of the time no I'm right absolutely always it was exceptional of cases yeah
03:12:33 when I'm wrong wrong which never happens yes it hasn't been observed ok so let me get your profound deep opinions about
03:12:44 artificial intelligence do you think we'll ever build systems that are as intelligent or more intelligent than
03:12:53 human beings in the same kind of way that we think humans are intelligent you know the most important is the last
03:13:03 remark which you made I strongly believe in their official intelligence I believe that it will be a lot of development in
03:13:10 the direction of like a human similarity to human but I've very much doubt about artificial consciousness this kind of
03:13:22 stuff from my point of view it's very questionable so I don't know what is consciousness to you consciousness it's
03:13:33 it's way more it's a wider stuff it's like a wow it's complex of feelings it's a complex of feelings like
03:13:43 intelligence its smartness it's a knowledge it's a disability to operate with knowledge consciousness it's its
03:13:54 knowledge but way much together with feelings do you think science will ever be able to understand consciousness so
03:14:02 here I believe I believe that sooner or later at least in this direction will be big breakthroughs so do you think do you
03:14:11 think could be able to put consciousness inside a Roomba inside a phone inside a camera devices consciousness
03:14:23 consciousness I don't know you know like a Jewish answer to most of the questions I mean we don't know yes we don't know I
03:14:33 mean I it's very difficult to predict what will happen with science and 300 years it's like to ask 300 years ago in
03:14:46 what in 19 in 1700 come on it's way before Napoleon yeah the in every years of last year's
03:14:52 of Luke at all whatever the Dalek for teens and you ask them about cell phones what do what do
03:15:07 if you ask Li cateura if you ask him a question what he thinks about cell phones he will say this we call a I am a
03:15:24 Sun King that's it no you're simplifying because perhaps the perhaps perhaps but because it is
03:15:32 another words cellphone but if I asked know about artificial intelligence then explained it correctly
03:15:35 he would actually have an opinion already they've had opinions about these kinds of things but yeah yeah sort of
03:15:41 can man this is a fundamental philosophical question can human beings create artificial versions of themselves
03:15:48 with Frankenstein other than me people have been thinking when you bring out a build of statues it's a and and people
03:15:56 have been maybe not Jews but people have been confidently providing answers okay what I can tell you my feeling yes
03:16:05 artificial person will be created okay so the way it is yeah how close it will be like a this like a synthetic
03:16:16 synthetic person will be with respect to reality yeah is it good or bad it's just different great but it is doable so we
03:16:23 have this disagreement a lot and you think that so do you think such a system needs to have a body and our
03:16:31 disagreement is often about the senses you say to have a full reading experience of consciousness you smell
03:16:39 touch so and I say you can do just words words and the image not even just words but yes image is helpful but words even
03:16:50 just the award's voice okay you know like don't forget I lived many years in France so for me smell like a Armagnac I
03:17:02 mean smell is very much often more important than taste yeah but image can be even less
03:17:12 important so just taste and smell so what I'm trying to say that I mean but that wait wait if I give you an option I
03:17:20 had to kill all your senses except one which one would you like to stay with I would not you know that's not it's like
03:17:29 a good question it's like a question you know if you have a choice to kill your father or mother what do you would do I
03:17:36 mean it's not the father well yeah what I'm trying to say that it's my feeling it's more holistic that
03:17:48 people they can lose one of feelings it's okay but yeah that's true and yes that's not
03:17:57 life but you think it's it's actually it's a bouquet including like you said cautiousness is a bouquet I like it but
03:18:04 you think a system should have a sense of smell sense of touch and my feeling is that it's not so difficult to do yes
03:18:13 from so this is where we have disagreements and debates and software or says hardware I mean you're much more
03:18:20 comfortable with hardware and and taste and smell these are kinds of things that it's it's almost like a sensor it's a
03:18:27 chemistry problem yeah but it with me actually I am from harmony I'm not saying this is hardware this software
03:18:35 yeah I would say that that's a it's not the bouquet in this case it's it's a harmony I mean yeah no I guess I come
03:18:42 from a world it's a very kind of AI world in computer science world where you think that most of the problems in
03:18:50 the world can be converted into a 99% software problem and that's that's the dream because it's easier than but but
03:19:01 do you know it was a Russian comedian absolutely beautiful shiny etske maybe he used to say in Russian the way it is
03:19:15 put it of Russia of streets is hypocritical Tony which is nothing probable what does it mean well how to
03:19:23 forget me translate it into English let's now don't even try it's fine Ehsan it's fine but what I'm trying to say
03:19:32 that this this is a poet is is it possible to describe with words tastes of oysters if you never ever try them
03:19:47 and that's very important moment sometimes this big data their official intelligence they say ok we don't need
03:19:54 smell we can describe what has been described as smell it means that they can collect data about like a smell of
03:20:02 cheese and put it in like a huge database and based on that to help you to choose what is the best chase without
03:20:11 smelling so this in this case I have to recommend to this computer or to this computer scientists to think about the netsuke
03:20:25 and this argument about taste of oysters without trying them at least once in their life ok that's why I think that
03:20:36 taste is important smell should be also encoded yeah I disagree because I think it is that so I agree that's very
03:20:43 important but I believe our mind and artificial minds will be able to fill in the gaps so without being able to smell
03:20:52 you you start without ever having tasted or smelled oysters you start imagining smell on taste it won't be connected to
03:20:59 reality at all but you construct a world that's consistent so I would say in this case it's not artificial intelligence
03:21:06 it's synthetic intelligence and I prefer it official because in the world artificial world art yeah you know what
03:21:16 I mean also and synthetic means like yeah you synthesize something yes no there's no it's lacking of the human experience
03:21:30 and artificial has that art yes well you you might you might be right because the only intelligent system we have now has
03:21:35 smell oh really ah okay very good I like it do you think about mortality your own mortality yes
03:21:56 because there is a three elements to that one like I'm a normal person and I especially in relation with parents when
03:22:20 you lost you know yes and mom also so you know yes you cannot let something which happened to everybody
03:22:30 at some point when you lose your father and mother you understand that now it's you you're next
03:22:43 that's into its well that's human the second element what I think about is religion because at least for me but for
03:22:53 many people also like going to beliefs of your parents grandparents etc helps helps and you start to understand the
03:23:04 older you are the closer you are to this moment the more you just feel it so all of the religion is huge and number three
03:23:12 I'm a scientist and a couple of weeks ago we had a long discussion on the conference
03:23:26 about immortality at the was of this cosmetic meeting because I mentioned to you that with this LVMH like a Louboutin
03:23:40 or whether and Hennessy that's the important one and then sporty one we have been talking about like a
03:23:46 possibility to change direction of Aging and this is one of challenges which actually in the beam of plasma medicine
03:23:56 we start trying to do it was like a kind of serious experiments trying to use in plasma tool to determine aging process I
03:24:04 can explain you details but it's a longer story but as a result of this experiments unfortunately we show that in a hundred
03:24:13 percent of like experiments we did we actually accelerated aging not but maybe we have two other ideas you might be
03:24:23 able to from a scientific perspective there is there is so hurt because you know that mortality it just glad or
03:24:33 major put it in us this mortality in which way we're stem cells and they just you know providing differentiation which
03:24:43 is like a renovation of us like when there is a tiny small kid he changed his no siren on each couple of days so just
03:24:52 it's it's always like a renovation of the tissue yes death and birth doesn't birth yeah it is not like I thought like
03:25:00 it knows is like growing no it's just as each time I have a new one now when in your age
03:25:08 like I wasn't buying it happen less often maybe once and I don't know 5 10 years but for me
03:25:15 fortunately are functioning like I will stay with this nose forever now so the only thing we have to do actually is
03:25:25 just to and this self themselves are still there we just but their efficiency is for some not very much known reason
03:25:35 went down down down down down down so what we have to do we have to actually help this stem cells stimulate them just
03:25:47 to become again more active and if we do that and plasma medicine tried then just you know instead of getting older and
03:25:55 other will go back younger and younger is it possible yes it's against rule of nature no so this is sword way to think about
03:26:05 that but that's a really challenge interesting that it was discussion on this subject with leave it on if science
03:26:16 does arrive at that breaker if you could live forever would you would you like to live forever I think yes I would try why
03:26:27 not you know let's well I'll give you a reason not is it makes a life you know the fact that stuff ends gives it some
03:26:41 deep meaning you know Jewish people basically they are deeply deeply deeply in love with life you know they say
03:26:59 Lehigh to life so Jewish people they actually believe that God gave us life to enjoy what will happen we'll have
03:27:10 another life or not or maybe it will be like again we'll be young is it possible the Jewish answer is
03:27:18 absolutely clear we don't know so but enjoying life it's the law absolute law so if you have possibility
03:27:32 to leave you have to go on with life as a Jewish answer and I like it are you afraid of death yes how you
03:27:45 remember when you asked me how long did you take for me to fall in love with with your mother 1 2 3 yeah yeah yeah
03:28:00 you answered that pretty quickly so what that's a difficult question you you never like this the silly questions
03:28:16 go back to your eighth grade self and be romantic for a second yeah what's the meaning of life yeah meaning of our
03:28:25 existence here on this little planet well I remember that I kept asking myself this question when I was in
03:28:32 eighth grade it was one of the crucial question for me Oh at that time by the exactly the same time when I roll this
03:28:43 romantic stuff and at that time I remember my answer I kept saying day by day which means the meaning of life is
03:28:59 just to enjoy enjoy today's life and go to tomorrow survive the day enjoy the day and use
03:29:07 your French existentialists you're a researcher and yes sir it's but you know at that time I didn't
03:29:19 have any knowledge about exists sure lists whatever Sartor yeah specialist tartar but I was actually sure about
03:29:33 that if you ask me now I would say I was right I I thought I thought that was a natural extension of the axiom which is
03:29:47 I'm always right yes yes yes but you know in each joke it's a 50% of joke if you present not but after reading it was
03:29:57 a book limo words right what's in English you say soccer sorry limo words slower I think in this book
03:30:12 he just when I read that it's basically absolutely bad book fleet yes archers I prefer Camus and the other
03:30:23 French guy yeah I just decide that I am I was not alone with this kind of ideas yeah there's other French guys what do
03:30:43 and next I'll ask you for advice and recalculating I know I'm not calculating I'm just trying to recall a very nice
03:31:03 poetry you know between I I love Russian poetry and it's interesting that my favorite Russian poet it's actually the
03:31:17 woman's it's a mini Nazi timer and she wrote like a short poetry just L saying that she said nationalist any
03:31:29 rationalist Paul navona assumes a brief yet aside nobility post yes way mr. Spacely well and it is in Russian but I
03:31:43 am I think that it's kind of deep and kind of smart I wish I wish you to be happy and I know that if I push you in
03:32:03 nothing happened I mean I okay I will be always recommending they always push on you and and don't forget I am always
03:32:11 pushing anyway but you know that and I have to do that because I am a father so I and I'm always pushing in conservative
03:32:22 direction because because I am a father and I very much wish you to have your son my grandson or granddaughter yeah I
03:32:31 almost guarantee you that will do the same he will not recommend your daughter to take a risk and to go to Hollywood try
03:32:40 to be an actress she's supposed to do it what and as and that's that's that's beautiful who make our own way and there
03:32:55 you always have given me a brilliant advice that I almost never follow and usually disagree with so but that's the
03:33:06 way it should be yeah that's the way of life well so what speaking of which what advice do you
03:33:19 have for me for the next 10 20 years in hesitating I'm thinking about I mean I have two ideas and they're kind of very
03:33:44 much wasn't yeah so from one hand my approach was the same as Sarah so just from one hand I like the idea just to
03:33:57 live your life and to enjoy and to be prepared for tomorrow which everything will restart again it's from one hand
03:34:09 from another hand I remember myself in elementary school he remember beginning of our discussion about this stupid guys
03:34:20 these idiots with stones and I just had an idea just to build a rocket to put there so I wanted to do and I did it so
03:34:34 this is another idea when you all just put your heart into something for a longer time not for one day but you have
03:34:45 to find your own way just and my feeling is it to you personally found it with artificial intelligence and that's why
03:34:58 my feeling is that in your specific case my advice will be just not to let them this idiots with stones to succeed you
03:35:09 have to deliver and that's what I'd like and that's what I made me dope with the mercury in the rocket but build the
03:35:17 rocket it's your choice yeah because that's a rocket which you're building but what is important
03:35:36 well I think this is a good time to  to maybe toast our family oh they do some we thought we'll do we'll probably
03:35:46 drink more vodka but we decided to be responsible adults and just save the vodka to the end it's always a question
03:35:53 how much vodka we have to drink in Russian tradition usually we calculate for adults like a one bottle per one
03:36:04 bottle per a person take a look at is made in Soviet Union and it's 1986 this is what girl of my
03:36:19 father because in 1986 in a year of Chernobyl he gave this bottle a friend of mine because this friend of mine he went to
03:36:30 America and he just missed my friend he just saved this basket for us to be able to just whatever to think about no
03:36:46 seasoning of my friend oh he's Sasha but we call him Shura Shura but that's the same thing as your best friend your
03:36:54 lifelong friend yes it's like you're mad mad mad matter any shoutout and first you can chose the family but let me just
03:37:06 toast to the best dad I've ever had the best that I could ever ask for our love you did yeah
