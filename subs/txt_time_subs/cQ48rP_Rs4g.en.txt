00:00:01 the following is a conversation of Chi Fuli he's the chairman and CEO of sin evasion ventures that manages a two
00:00:10 billion dollar dual currency investment fund with a focus on developing the next generation of Chinese high-tech
00:00:16 companies he's the former president of Google China and the founder of what is now called Microsoft Research Asia an
00:00:24 institute that trained many of the artificial intelligence leaders in China including CTOs or AI execs at Baidu
00:00:35 Tencent Alibaba innova and Huawei he was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine
00:00:42 he's the author of seven best-selling books in Chinese and most recently the New York Times bestseller called AI
00:00:50 superpowers China Silicon Valley and the New World Order he has unparalleled experience in
00:00:57 working across major tech companies and governments and applications of AI and so he has a unique perspective on global
00:01:05 innovation in the future of AI that I think is important to listen to and think about this is the artificial

00:01:19 connect with me on Twitter at lex friedman and now here's my conversation with chi foo lee
00:01:28 I emigrated from Russia to US when I was 13 you emigrated to us at about the same age the Russian people the American
00:01:36 people the Chinese people each have a certain soul a spirit that permeates throughout the generations so maybe it's
00:01:45 a little bit of a poetic question but could you describe your sense of what defines the Chinese soul I think the
00:01:56 Chinese soul of people today right we're talking about people who have had centuries of burden because of the
00:02:04 poverty that the country has gone through and suddenly shined with hope of prosperity in the past 40 years as China
00:02:15 opened up and embraced market economy and undoubtedly there are two sets of pressures on the people that of the
00:02:26 tradition that of facing difficult situations and that of Hope of wanting to be the first to become successful and
00:02:35 wealthy so that it's a very strong a hunger and strong desire and strong work ethic that drives China forward and is
00:02:43 their roots to not just this generation but before that's that's deeper than just the new economic development is
00:02:51 there something that's unique to China that you could speak to that's in the people yeah
00:02:59 well the Chinese some tradition is about excellence dedication and results and the Chinese exams and study subjects in
00:03:09 schools have traditionally started from memorizing ten thousand characters not an easy task
00:03:14 to start with and further by memorizing his historic philosophers literature poetry so it really is the probably the
00:03:23 strongest rote learning mechanism created to make sure people had good memory and remembered things extremely
00:03:32 well that's I think at the same time suppresses the breakthrough innovation and also enhances
00:03:43 the speed execution get results and that I think characterizes the historic basis serve on China that's interesting
00:03:49 because there's echoes of that and Russian education as well as rote memorization to memorize a lot of poche
00:03:56 I mean there's just the emphasis on perfection in all forms mmm that's not conducive to perhaps what you're
00:04:03 speaking to which is creativity but you and you think that kind of education holds back the innovative spirit that
00:04:11 you might see in the United States well it holds back the breakthrough innovative spirits that we see in the
00:04:17 United States but it does not hold back the valuable execution oriented result-oriented value creating engines
00:04:27 which we see China being very successful so is there a difference between a Chinese AI engineer today and an
00:04:35 American AI engineer perhaps rooted in the culture that we just talked about or the education or the very soul of the
00:04:42 people or no and what would your advice be to each if there's a difference well there's a lot that's similar because AI
00:04:51 is about mastering Sciences about using known technologies and trying new things but it's also about picking from many
00:05:00 parts of possible networks to use and different types of parameters to tune and that part is somewhat rote and it is
00:05:08 also as anyone who's built AI products can tell you a lot about cleansing the data because AI runs better with more
00:05:18 data and data is generally unstructured error error fall and unclean and the effort to clean the data is is immense
00:05:30 so I think the better part of American engineering ai engineering process is to try new things to do things people
00:05:39 haven't done before and to use technology to solve most if not all problems so to make the algorithm work
00:05:47 despite not so great data find you know error tolerant ways to deal with the data the Chinese way would be
00:05:56 - basically enumerate to the fullest extent all the possible ways by a lot of machines try lots of different ways to
00:06:03 get it to work and spend a lot of resources and money and time cleaning up data that mean that means the AI
00:06:11 engineer may be writing data cleansing algorithms working with thousands of people who label or correct or do things
00:06:20 with the data that is the incredible hard work that might lead to better results so the Chinese engineer would
00:06:28 rely on and ask for more and more and more data and find ways to cleanse them and make them work in the system and
00:06:35 probably less time thinking about new algorithms that can overcome they there are other issues so where's your
00:06:41 intuition what do you think the biggest impact the next 10 years lies is it in some breakthrough algorithms or is it in
00:06:53 just this at scale rigor a rigorous approach to data cleaning data organizing data onto the same algorithm
00:07:02 packed in the applied world is well if you're really in the company and you have to deliver results using known
00:07:10 techniques and enhancing data seems like the more expedient approach that's very low risk and likely to generate better
00:07:17 and better results and that's why the Chinese approach has done quite well now there are a lot of more challenging
00:07:26 startups and problems such as autonomous vehicles medical diagnosis that existing algorithms may probably won't solve and
00:07:37 that would put the Chinese approach more challenged and give them more breakthrough innovation approach more
00:07:44 more of an edge on those kinds of problems so let me talk to that a little more so you know my intuition personally
00:07:52 is that data can take us extremely far so you brought up autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis so your intuition
00:08:00 is that huge amounts of data might not be able to completely help us solve that problem right so breaking that down
00:08:08 further in autonomous vehicle I think huge amounts of data probably will solve trucks driving on highways which will
00:08:16 deliver a significant value and China will probably lead in that and full l5 autonomous is likely to require new
00:08:26 technologies we don't yet know and that might require academia and great industrial research both innovating and
00:08:34 working together and in that case us has an advantage so the interesting question in there is I don't know if you're
00:08:39 familiar on the autonomous vehicle space and the developments with Tesla and Elon Musk I am where they are in fact full
00:08:51 steam ahead into this mysterious complex world of full autonomy l5 l4 l5 and they're trying to solve that purely with
00:08:59 data so the same kind of thing that you're saying is just for highway which is what a lot of people share your
00:09:06 intuition yeah they're trying to solve with data it's just a linger on that moment forever do you think possible for
00:09:14 them to achieve success with simply just a huge amount of this training on edge cases on difficult cases in urban
00:09:21 environments not just highway and so on I think they'll be very hard one could characterize Tesla's approach as kind of
00:09:30 a Chinese strength approach right gather all the data you can and hope that will overcome the problems but in autonomous
00:09:37 driving clearly a lot of the decisions aren't nearly solved by aggregating data and having a feedback loop there are
00:09:46 things that are more akin to human thinking and how would those be integrated and built there has not yet
00:09:55 been a lot of success integrating human intelligence or you know call it expert systems to be well even though that's a
00:10:02 taboo word with the machine learning and the integration the two types of thinking hasn't yet been demonstrated
00:10:09 and the question is how much can you push a purely machine learning approach and of course Tesla also has an
00:10:16 additional constraint that they don't have all the sensors I know that they think is foolish to use
00:10:22 lidar s but that's clearly a one less very valuable and reliable source of inputs that they're forgoing which may
00:10:32 also have consequences I think the advantage of course is capturing data no one has ever seen before and in some
00:10:40 cases such as computer vision and speech recognition I have seen Chinese companies accumulate data that's not
00:10:46 seeing anywhere in the Western world and they have delivered superior results but then speech recognition and object
00:10:55 recognition are relatively suitable problems for deep learning and don't have the potentially need for the human
00:11:03 intelligence analytical planning elements in the same on the speech recognition side your intuition that
00:11:09 speech recognition and the machine learning approaches to speech recognition won't take us to a
00:11:15 conversational system that can pass the Turing test which is sort of maybe akin to what driving is so it needs to have
00:11:25 something more than just simply simple language understanding simple language generation roughly right I would say
00:11:32 that's based on purely machine learning approaches it's hard to imagine it could lead to a full conversational experience
00:11:43 across arbitrary domains which is akin to l5 I'm a little hesitant to use the word Turing tests because the original
00:11:50 definition was probably too easy we probably do that yeah the spirit of the Turing test that's what I was referring
00:11:58 of course so you've had major leadership research positions at Apple Microsoft Google so continuing on the discussion
00:12:06 of America Russia Chinese soul and culture and so on what is the culture Silicon Valley in
00:12:16 contrast to China and maybe us broadly and what is the unique culture of each of these three major companies in your
00:12:23 view I think in aggregates Silicon Valley companies and we could probably include Microsoft in that even though
00:12:30 they're not in the valley is really dream big and have visionary goals and believe
00:12:37 that technology will conquer all and also the self confidence and the self entitlement that whatever they
00:12:45 produce the whole world should use and must use and those are historically important I think you know Steve Jobs
00:12:58 famous quote that he doesn't do focus groups he looks in the mirror and asks the first in the mirror what do you want
00:13:06 and that really is an inspirational comment that says the great company shouldn't just ask users what they want
00:13:13 but develop something that users will know that they want when they see it but they could never come up with themselves
00:13:21 I think that is probably the most exhilarating description of what the essence of Silicon Valley is that this
00:13:30 brilliant idea could cause you to build something that couldn't come out of focus groups or a be tests and iPhone
00:13:38 would be an example of that no one in the age of blackberry would write down they want an iPhone or multi-touch a
00:13:44 browser might be another example no one would say they want that in the days of FTP but once they see it they want it so
00:13:52 I think that is was Silicon Valley's best at but it also comes with came with a lot of success these products became
00:14:02 global platforms and there were basically no competitors anywhere and that has also led to belief that these
00:14:12 are the only things that one should do that companies should not tread on other companies territory so that's a you know
00:14:23 Groupon and the Yelp and then open table and the GrubHub with each field ok I'm not gonna do the other company's
00:14:30 business because that would not be the pride of innovating whatever each of these four companies have innovated but
00:14:40 I think the Chinese approach is do whatever it takes to win and it's a winner take all market
00:14:47 and in fact in the internet space the market leader will get predominantly all the value extracted out of the system so
00:14:56 and the and the and the system isn't just defined as one narrow category but gets broader and broader so it's amazing
00:15:08 ambition for success and domination of increasingly larger product categories leading to clear market winner status
00:15:16 and the opportunity to extract tremendous value and that develops a practical result oriented ultra
00:15:29 ambitious winner-take-all gladiatorial mentality and if what it takes is to build what the competitors built
00:15:39 essentially a copycat that can be done without infringing laws if what it takes is to satisfy a foreign country's need
00:15:48 by forking the codebase and building something that looks really ugly and different they'll do it so it's
00:15:54 contrasted very sharply with the Silicon Valley approach and I think the flexibility and the speed and execution
00:16:02 has helped the Chinese approach and I think the Silicon Valley approach is potentially challenged if every Chinese
00:16:11 entrepreneurs learning from the whole world US and China and the American entrepreneurs only look internally and
00:16:20 right off China as copycat and the second part of your question about the three companies the unique elements of
00:16:27 the three companies perhaps yeah I think Apple represents while the user please the user and the essence of design and
00:16:41 brand and it's the one company and perhaps the only tech company that draws people with a a strong serious desire
00:16:51 for the product and the knee and the willingness to pay a premium because of the halo effect of the brand which came
00:16:58 from the attention to detail and great respect for user needs microsoft represents a
00:17:10 platform approach that builds giant products that become very strong modes that others can't do because it's well
00:17:22 architected at the bottom level and the work is efficiently delegated to individuals and then the the the whole
00:17:32 product is build by adding small parts that sum together so it's probably the most effective high tech assembly
00:17:39 line that builds a very difficult product that and the whole process of doing that is kind of a differentiation
00:17:51 and something competitors can't easily repeat are there elements of the Chinese approach and the way Microsoft went
00:17:59 about assembling those little pieces and dominating them was essentially dominating the market for a long time or
00:18:05 do you see this is distinct I think there are elements that are the same I think the three American companies that
00:18:13 had or have Chinese characteristics and obviously as well as American characteristics are Microsoft Facebook
00:18:21 and Amazon yes that's right Amazon because these are companies that will tenaciously go after adjacent markets
00:18:31 build up strong private offering and and find ways to extract greater value from a sphere that's ever-increasing and they
00:18:43 understand the value of the platforms so that's the similarity and then with Google I think is a genuinely value
00:18:55 oriented company that does have a heart and soul and that wants to do great things for the world by connecting
00:19:06 information and that has also very strong technology genes and wants to use technology and has found
00:19:18 out-of-the-box ways to use technology to deliver incredible value to the end-user we can look at Google for example you
00:19:28 mentioned heart and soul there seems to be an element where Google is after making the world better there's a more
00:19:37 positive view I mean I used to have the slogan don't be evil yeah and and Facebook a little bit more as a negative
00:19:44 tint to it at least in the perception of privacy and so on do you have a sense of how these different companies can
00:19:53 achieve because you've talked about how much we can make the world better in all these kinds of ways with AI what is it
00:19:59 about a company that can make give it a heart and soul gain the trust of the public and just actually just not be
00:20:08 evil and do good for the world it's really hard and I think Google has struggled with that first that don't do
00:20:16 evil mantra is very dangerous because every employees definition of evil is different and that has led to some
00:20:24 difficult employee situations for them so I don't necessarily think that's a good value statement but just watching
00:20:32 the kinds of things Google or its parent company alphabet does in new areas like health care like you know eradicating
00:20:41 mosquitoes things that are really not in the business of a Internet tech company I think that shows that there is the
00:20:49 heart and soul and desire to do good and willingness to put in the resources to do something when they see it's good
00:20:58 they will pursue it that doesn't necessarily mean it has all the trust of the users I realize while most people
00:21:07 would view Facebook as the primary target of their recent and happiness about Silicon Valley companies many
00:21:13 would put Google in that category and some have named Google's business practices as predatory also so it's kind
00:21:23 of difficult to have the two parts of a body the brain wants to do what it's supposed to do for shareholder
00:21:29 maximize profit and then the heart and soul wants to do good things that may run against at what that brain wants to
00:21:39 do so in this complex balancing that these companies have to do you've mentioned that you're concerned about a
00:21:45 future were too few companies like Google Facebook Amazon are controlling our data are controlling too much of our
00:21:54 digital lives can you elaborate on this concern and perhaps do you have a better way forward
00:22:01 I think I'm hardly the most vocal a complainer of this course there are a lot louder complaints out there I do
00:22:12 observe that's having a lot of data thus perpetuates their strengths and limit competition in many spaces but I also
00:22:22 believe a AI is much broader than the internet space so the entrepreneurial opportunity still exists in using AI to
00:22:32 empower financial retail manufacturing education applications so I don't think it's quite a case of full
00:22:40 monopolistic dominance that makes that totally stifles innovation but I do believe in their areas of strength is
00:22:50 hard to to dislodge them I don't know if I have a good solution probably the best solution is let the entrepreneurial VC
00:23:00 ecosystem work well and find all the places that can create the next Google the next Facebook so there will always
00:23:08 be increasing number of challengers in some sense that has happened a little bit you see uber Airbnb having emerged
00:23:16 despite the strength of the that the big three and and I think China as an environment may be more interesting for
00:23:26 the emergence because if you look at companies between let's say 50 to 300 billion dollars China has emerged more
00:23:36 of such companies than the you in the in the last three to four years because of the larger marketplace
00:23:44 because of the more fearless nature of the entrepreneurs that and and the Chinese Giants are just as powerful as
00:23:52 American ones Tenzin Alibaba very strong but by tense has emerged worth 75 billion and financial well it's Alibaba
00:24:01 affiliated it's nevertheless independent and worth 150 billion and so III do think if we start to extend to
00:24:10 traditional businesses we will see value very valuable companies so it's probably not the case that in five or ten years
00:24:19 we'll still see the whole world with these five companies having such dominance so you've mentioned a couple
00:24:27 times this fascinating world of entrepreneurship in China of the fearless nature of the entrepreneur so
00:24:32 can you maybe talk a little bit about what it takes to be an entrepreneur in China what are the strategies that are
00:24:40 undertaken what are the ways to achieve success what is the dynamic of vfc funding of the way the government helps
00:24:46 companies isn't one what are the interesting aspects here that are distinct from they're different from the
00:24:54 Silicon Valley world of entrepreneurship home many of the listeners probably still would brand Chinese entrepreneur
00:25:04 as copycats and no doubt ten years ago that would not be an inaccurate description back ten years ago an
00:25:12 entrepreneur probably could not get funding if he or she could not describe what product he or she is copying from
00:25:21 the US the first question is who has proven this business model which is a nice way of asking Corey copying and and
00:25:30 that reason is understandable because China had a much lower internet penetration and and didn't have enough
00:25:41 indigenous experience to build secondly the internet was emerging link startup was the way to do things
00:25:52 building a first minimally viable products and then expanding was the right way to go and the American
00:25:59 successes have given the shortcuts that if you took your if you build your minimally Viable Product based on an
00:26:05 American product it's guaranteed to be a decent starting point then you tweak it afterwards so as long as there's no IP
00:26:12 infringement which as far as no there hasn't been in the mobile and AI spaces that's a much better shortcut and I
00:26:21 think Silicon Valley would view that as still not very honorable because that's not your own idea to start with but you
00:26:32 can't really at the same time believe every idea must be your own and believe in the Lean Startup methodology because
00:26:41 Lean Startup is intended to try many many things and then converge one that works and it's meant to be iterating
00:26:48 changed so finding a decent starting point without legal violations there should be nothing morally dishonorable
00:26:56 about that so just a quick pause on that it's fascinating that that's is why is that not honorable right he's exactly as
00:27:05 you formulated is it seems like a perfect start for business yeah is to to take you know look at Amazon and say
00:27:13 okay well we'll do exactly what Amazon is doing let's start there yeah in this particular market and then let's I'll
00:27:20 innovate them from that starting point yes I'm up with new ways I mean is it wrong to be accept the word copy catchy
00:27:28 sounds bad but is it wrong to be a copycat it just seems like a smart strategy but yes doesn't have a heroic
00:27:37 nature to it yeah that like I said like a Steve Jobs Elon Musk sort of in something completely coming up with
00:27:44 something completely new yeah I like the way you describe it it's a non heroic acceptable way to start the company and
00:27:54 maybe more expedient so that's the that's I think a baggage for silicon vally that if it doesn't let go then it
00:28:04 made limits the ultimate ceiling of the company take snapchat as an example I think you know Evans brilliance he build
00:28:13 great products but he's very proud that he wants to build his own features not copy others while Facebook was more
00:28:21 willing to copy his features and you see what happens in the competition so I think putting that handcuff on a company
00:28:29 would limit its ability to reach the maximum potential so back to the Chinese environment copying was merely a way to
00:28:38 learn from the American masters just like we if you would we learned to play piano or painting you start by copying
00:28:46 you don't start by innovating when you don't have the basic skill sets so very amazingly the Chinese entrepreneurs
00:28:55 about six years ago started to branch off with these lean startups built on American ideas to build better products
00:29:02 than American products but they did start from the American idea and today we we Chad is better than whatsapp Weibo
00:29:10 is better than Twitter and Yahoo is better than Korra and so on so that I think is some Chinese entrepreneurs
00:29:19 going to step two and in step three is once these entrepreneurs have done one or two of these companies they they now
00:29:26 look at the Chinese market and the opportunities and come up with ideas that didn't exist elsewhere so products
00:29:35 like and financial under which includes Ali pay which is mobile payments and also the financial products for loans
00:29:46 built on that and also in education VIP kid and in social video social network tick-tock and in social ecommerce pin
00:30:01 dodo and then in ride-sharing mo bike these are all Chinese innovative products that now are being copied
00:30:11 elsewhere so and and the additional interesting herbs raishin is some of these products are
00:30:16 built on unique Chinese demographics which may not work in the US but may work very well in Southeast Asia Africa
00:30:25 and other developing worlds that are a few years behind China and a few of these products may be armed Universal
00:30:32 and are getting traction even in the United States such as tick tock so this whole ecosystem is supported by VCS
00:30:44 as a virtuous cycle because a large market with with innovative entrepreneurs will draw a lot of money
00:30:51 and then invest in these companies so as the market gets larger and larger u.s. mark China  market is easily three four
00:30:58 times larger than the u.s. they will create greater value and greater returns for the VCS thereby raising even more money
00:31:08 so at San ovations ventures our first fund was fifteen million our last fund was five hundred million so it reflects
00:31:16 the valuation of the companies and our us going multistage and things like that it also has government support but not
00:31:25 in the way most Americans would think of it the government actually leaves the entrepreneurial space as a private
00:31:32 enterprise so they're self-regulating and the government would build infrastructures that would around it to
00:31:40 make it work better for example the mass entrepreneur mass innovation plan builds eight thousand incubators so the
00:31:48 pipeline is very strong to the VCS for autonomous vehicles the Chinese government is building smart highways
00:31:55 with sensors smart cities that separate pedestrians from cars that may allow initially an inferior autonomous vehicle
00:32:04 company to launch a car without increasing with lower casualty because the roads or the city is smart and the
00:32:13 Chinese government at local levels would have these guiding funds acting as LPS passive LPS to funds and when the fund
00:32:23 makes money part of the money made is given back to the GPS and potentially other LPS to reach increase everybody's
00:32:32 return at the expense of the government's return so that's interesting incentive that and trusts
00:32:40 that task of choosing entrepreneurs to VCS who are better added in the government by letting some of the
00:32:47 profits I'll move that way so this is really fascinating right so I look at the Russian government as a case study
00:32:54 where let me put it this way there is no such government driven large-scale support of entrepreneurship and probably
00:33:03 the same is true in the United States but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of find a way yeah so maybe in a form of
00:33:12 advice or explanation how did the Chinese government arrive to be this way so supportive entrepreneurship to be in
00:33:21 this particular way so forward-thinking at such a large scale and also perhaps how can we copy it in other countries
00:33:29 yeah that how can we encourage other governments given the United States government to support infrastructure for
00:33:34 autonomous vehicles in that same kind of way perhaps yes so these some techniques are the result of several key things
00:33:46 some of which may be learn the both some of which may be very hard one is just trial and error and watching what
00:33:53 everyone else is doing I think it's important to be humble and not feel like you know all the answers the guiding
00:33:59 funds idea came from Singapore which came from Israel and China made a few tweaks and turned it into a because the
00:34:08 Chinese cities and government officials kind of compete with each other because they all want to make their city more
00:34:15 successful so they can get the next level in their crew in their political career and it's somewhat competitive so
00:34:24 the central government made it a bit of a competition everybody has a budget they can put it on AI or they can put it
00:34:31 on bio or they can put it on energy and then whoever gets the results the city shines the people are better off the
00:34:37 mayor gets a promotion so the tools kind of almost like an entrepreneurial
00:34:45 environment for local governments to see who can do a better job and also many of them try different experiments some have
00:34:57 given award to very smart researchers just give them money and hope they'll start the company some have
00:35:05 given money to academic research labs maybe government research labs to see if they can spin-off some companies from
00:35:13 the science lab or something like that some have tried to recruit overseas Chinese to come back and start companies
00:35:21 and they've had mixed results the one that worked the best was the guiding funds so it's almost like a Lean Startup
00:35:27 idea where people try different things and what works sticks and everybody copies so now every city has a guiding
00:35:35 fund so that's how that came about the autonomous vehicle and the massive spending in highways in smart cities
00:35:46 that's a Chinese way it's about building infrastructure to facilitate it's a clear division of the government's
00:35:55 responsibility from the market the markets should do everything in a private freeway but there are things the
00:36:03 market can't afford to do like infrastructure so the government always appropriate large amounts of money for
00:36:12 infrastructure building this happened happens with not only autonomous vehicle in the eye
00:36:20 but happened with the 3G and 4G you'll find that the Chinese a wireless reception is better than the u.s.
00:36:29 because massive spending that tries to cover the whole country whereas in the US it may be a little spotty it's a
00:36:36 government driven because I think they view the coverage of of cell access and 3G 4G access to be a governmental
00:36:48 infrastructure spending as opposed to as opposed to capitalistic so that's of course the state-owned enterprises also public
00:36:56 traded but they also carry a government responsibility to deliver infrastructure to all so it's a different way of
00:37:03 thinking that may be very hard to inject into Western countries to say starting tomorrow bandwidth infrastructure and highways
00:37:13 are going to be governmental spending with some characteristics what's your sense and sorry to interrupt but because
00:37:21 it's such a fascinating point do you think on the autonomous vehicle space it's possible to solve the problem of
00:37:31 full autonomy without significant investment in infrastructure well that's really hard to speculate I think it's
00:37:39 not a yes/no question but how long does it take question you know 15 years 30 years 45 years clearly with
00:37:49 infrastructure augmentation where there's ro the city or whole city planning building a new city I'm sure
00:37:58 that will accelerate the day of the l5 I I'm not knowledgeable enough and it's hard to predict even one we're
00:38:04 knowledgeable because a lot of it is speculative but in the US I don't think people would consider building a new
00:38:13 city the size of Chicago to make it a I slash autonomous city they're smaller ones being built I'm aware of that
00:38:21 but is infrastructure spent really impossible for us or Western countries I don't think so the u.s. highway system
00:38:30 was built was that during President Eisenhower or Kennedy as Eisenhower yeah so so so maybe historians can study how
00:38:39 the President Eisenhower get the resources to build this massive infrastructure that surely gave us
00:38:47 tremendous amount of prosperity over the next decade if not century if I may comment on that then it takes us to
00:38:55 artificial intelligence a little bit because in order to build infrastructure it it creates a lot of jobs so I'll be
00:39:03 actually interested if you would say that you talk in your book about all kinds of jobs that could
00:39:10 could not be automated I wonder if building infrastructures one of the jobs that would not be easily automated
00:39:17 something you could think about because they think you mentioned somewhere in the talk or that there there might be as
00:39:24 jobs are being automated a role for government to create jobs that can't be automated yes I think that's a possibility
00:39:35 back in the last financial crisis China puts a lot of money to basically give this economy a boost and a lot of it a
00:39:43 lot of the one into infrastructure building and and I think that's a legitimate way and the government level
00:39:54 to to deal with the employment issues as well as build out the infrastructure as long as the infrastructures are truly
00:40:01 needed and as long as there isn't an employment problem which no we don't know so maybe taking a little step back
00:40:11 if you've been a leader and a researcher in AI for several decades at least 30 years so how is AI changed in the west
00:40:21 and the east as you've observed as you've been deep in it over the past 30 years well a I began as the pursuits of
00:40:30 understanding human intelligence and the term itself represents that but it kind of drifted into the one sub area that
00:40:39 worked extremely well which is machine intelligence and that's actually more using pattern recognition techniques to
00:40:49 basically do incredibly well on the limited or domain large amount of data but relatively simple kinds of farm
00:40:58 planning tasks and not very creative so so we didn't end up building human intelligence we built a different machine that was a
00:41:08 lot better than us some problems but nowhere close to us other problems so today I think a lot of people still
00:41:17 misunderstand when we say artificial intelligence and what various products can do
00:41:22 people still think it's about replicating human intelligence but the products out there really are closer to
00:41:30 having invented the internet or the spreadsheet or the database and getting broader adoption and peeking further to
00:41:38 the fears near-term fears that people have about AI so you're commenting on the sort of the
00:41:45 general intelligence that people in the popular culture from sci-fi movies have a sense about AI but there's practical
00:41:53 fears about AI the kind the narrow AI that you're talking about of automating particular kinds of jobs and you talk
00:42:00 about them in the book so what are the kinds of jobs in your view that you see in the next 5-10 years beginning to be
00:42:09 automated by AI systems algorithms yes this is a also maybe a little bit counterintuitive because it's the
00:42:17 routine jobs that will be displaced the soonest and they may not be displaced entirely maybe 50% 80% of a job but when
00:42:26 the workload drops by that much employment will come down and also another part of misunderstanding as most
00:42:35 people think of AI replacing routine jobs then they think of the assembly line the workers well that will have
00:42:42 some effect but it's actually the routine white-collar workers that's easier to replace because to replace the
00:42:49 white-collar worker you just need software to replace a blue-collar worker you need robotics mechanical excellence
00:43:01 and the ability to deal with dexterity and maybe even unknown environments very very difficult so if we were to
00:43:10 categorize the most dangerous white-collar jobs there would be things like back-office
00:43:18 people who copy and paste and deal with simple computer programs and data and maybe paper and OCR and they don't make
00:43:29 strategic decisions they basically facilitate the process the software and papers don't work so you have people dealing
00:43:41 with new employee orientation searching for past lawsuits and financial documents and doing reference check for
00:43:50 basic searching and management of data data that's the most in danger of being lost in addition to the white-collar
00:43:58 repetitive work a lot of simple interaction work can also be taken care of such as telesales telemarketing
00:44:05 customer service as well as many physical jobs that are in the same location and don't require a high degree
00:44:13 of dexterity so fruit picking dishwashing assembly line inspection our jobs in that category so all together
00:44:26 back office is a big part and the other the the the blue-collar may be smaller initially but over time they I will get
00:44:34 better and when we start to get to over the next 15 20 years the ability to actually have the dexterity of doing
00:44:41 assembly line that's a huge chunk of jobs and and when autonomous vehicles start to work initially starting with
00:44:48 truck drivers but eventually to all drivers that's another huge group of workers so I see modest numbers in the
00:44:56 next five years but increasing rapidly after that I'm worried of the jobs that are in danger and the gradual loss of
00:45:04 jobs I'm not sure if you're familiar with Andrew yang yes I am so there's a candidate for president of the United
00:45:12 States whose platform Andrew yang is based around in part around job loss due to automation and also in addition the
00:45:22 need perhaps of universal basic income to support jobs that are folks who lose their job due to automation and so on
00:45:30 and in general support people under complex unstable job market so what are your thoughts about his concerns him as
00:45:40 a candidate his ideas in general I think his thinking is generally in the right direction but his approach as a presidential
00:45:50 candidate maybe a little bit head at a time I think the displacements will happen but will they happen soon enough for
00:46:00 people to agree to vote for him the unemployment numbers are not very high yet and I think you know he and I
00:46:08 have the same challenge if I want to theoretically convince people this is an issue and he wants to become the
00:46:16 president people have to see how can this be the case when an employment numbers are low so that is the challenge
00:46:24 and I think I think we do I do agree with him on the displacement issue on universal basic income at a very vanilla
00:46:34 level I don't agree with it because I think the main issue is retraining so people need to be incented not by just
00:46:45 giving a monthly $2,000 check or $1,000 check and do whatever they want because they don't have to know how to know what
00:46:56 to retrain to go into what type of a job and guidance is needed and Retraining is needed because historically when
00:47:03 technology revolutions when routine jobs were displaced new routine jobs came up so they there was always room for that
00:47:11 but with a eye on automation the whole point is replacing all routine jobs eventually so there will be fewer
00:47:19 and fewer routine jobs and an AI will create jobs but it won't create routine jobs because if it creates routine jobs
00:47:27 why wouldn't a I just do it so therefore the people who are losing the jobs aren't losing routine jobs the jobs that
00:47:34 are becoming available are non routine jobs so the social stipend needs to be put in place is for the routine workers who
00:47:43 lost their jobs to be retrained maybe in six months maybe in three years takes a while to retrain on a non routine job
00:47:51 and then take out a job that will last for that person's lifetime now having said that if you look deeply into
00:47:58 Andrews document he does cater for that so I'm not disagreeing with what he's trying to do but for simplification
00:48:07 sometimes he just says ubi but simple ubi wouldn't work and I think you've mentioned elsewhere that I mean the goal
00:48:15 isn't necessarily to give people enough money to survive or live or even to prosper the point is to give them a job
00:48:23 that gives a meaning that meaning is extremely important that our employment at least in the United States and
00:48:30 perhaps it cares across the world provides something that's forgive me for saying greater than money it provides
00:48:42 meaning so now what kind of jobs do you think can't be automated you talk a little bit about creativity and
00:48:49 compassion in your book what aspects do you think it's difficult to automate for an AI system because an AI system is
00:48:58 currently merely optimizing it's not able to reason plan or think creatively or strategically it's not able to deal
00:49:07 with complex problems it can't come up with a new problem and solve it a human needs to find the problem and pose it as
00:49:17 an optimization problem then have the AI work habits so in AI would have a very hard time discovering a new drug or
00:49:27 discovering a new style of painting or dealing with complex tasks that such as managing a company that isn't just about
00:49:35 optimizing the bottom line but also about employee satisfaction corporate brand and many many other things so that
00:49:45 is one category of things and because these things are challenging creative complex doing them creates a higher high
00:49:53 degree of satisfaction and therefore appealing to our desire for working which isn't just to make the money make
00:50:00 the ends meet but also that we've accomplished something that others maybe can't do or can do as well
00:50:06 another type of job that is much numerous would be compassionate jobs jobs that require calm
00:50:15 empathy human touch human trusts hey I can't do that because AI is cold calculating and even if it can fake that
00:50:24 to some extent it will make errors and that will make it look very silly and also I think even if they added okay
00:50:31 people would want to interact with the people another person whether it's for some kind of a service or a teacher or a
00:50:40 doctor or concierge or a masseuse or a bartender there are so many jobs where people just don't want to interact with
00:50:51 a cold robot or software I've had an entrepreneur who built an elderly care robot and they found that the elderly
00:50:57 really only used it for customer service and huh but not to service the product but they
00:51:03 click on the customer service and the video of a person comes up and then the person says how come my daughter didn't
00:51:11 call me let me show you the grandkids so people learn for that people people interaction so even the robots improved
00:51:19 people just don't want it and those jobs are going to be increasing because AI will create a lot of value 16 trillion
00:51:27 dollars to the world in next 11 years according to PwC and that will give people money to enjoy services whether
00:51:38 it's eating a gourmet meal or tourism and traveling or having concierge services the the service is revolving
00:51:46 around you know every dollar of that 16 trillion dollars will be tremendous it will create more opportunities that are
00:51:52 to service the people who did well through AI with with with things but even at the same time the entire society
00:52:02 is very much short in need of many service oriented compassionate oriented jobs the best example is probably in
00:52:11 healthcare services there's going to be 2 million new jobs not coming replacement just in brand-new
00:52:18 incremental jobs in the next six years in health care services that includes nurses orderly in the hospital
00:52:29 elderly care and and also at home care it's particularly lacking and those jobs are not likely to be filled so there's
00:52:37 likely to be a shortage and the reason they're not filled is simply because they don't pay very well and that the
00:52:46 social status of these jobs are not very good so they pay about half as much as a heavy equipment operator which will be
00:52:56 replaced a lot sooner and they pay probably comparably to someone on the assembly line and if so if we ignoring
00:53:03 all the other issues and just think about satisfaction from one's job someone repetitively doing the same
00:53:11 manual action and assembly line that can't create a lot of job satisfaction but someone taking care of a sick person
00:53:19 and and getting a hug and thank you from that person in the and the family I think is is quite satisfying
00:53:27 so if only we could fix the pay for service jobs there are plenty of jobs that require some training or a lot of
00:53:35 training for the people coming off the routine jobs to take we can easily imagine someone who was maybe a cashier
00:53:44 at the grocery store s stores become automated learned to become a nurse or a at home care also to one the point now
00:53:53 the blue-collar jobs are going to stay around a bit longer some of them quite a bit longer
00:53:59 you know a I cannot be told go clean an arbitrary home that's incredibly hard arguably is an l5 level
00:54:08 of difficulty right and then AI cannot be a good plumber because plumber is almost like a mini
00:54:14 detective that has to figure out where the leak came from so yet AI probably can be an assembly line and auto
00:54:24 mechanic and so on so one has to study which blue-collar jobs are going away and facilitate retraining for the people
00:54:30 to go into the ones that won't go away or maybe even will increase I mean it is fascinating that it's easier to build
00:54:39 a world champion chess player than it is to build a mediocre plumber yes right very true iji and that goes
00:54:47 counterintuitive to a lot of people's understanding of what artificial intelligence is so it sounds I mean
00:54:52 you're painting a pretty optimistic picture about retraining about the number of jobs and actually the
00:54:59 meaningful nature of those jobs once we automate repetitive tasks so overall are you optimistic about the future where
00:55:10 much of the repetitive tasks are automated that there is a lot of room for humans for the compassionate for the
00:55:18 creative input that only humans can provide I am optimistic if we start to take action if we have no action in the
00:55:28 next five years I think it's going to be hard to deal with the devastating losses that will emerge so if we start thinking
00:55:37 about retraining maybe with the low-hanging fruits explaining to vocational schools why they should train
00:55:46 more plumbers that other mechanics may be starting with some government subsidy for corporations to have more training
00:55:55 positions we start to explain to people why retraining is important we start to think about what the future of education
00:56:03 how that needs to be tweaked for the era of AI if we start to make incremental progress and the greater number of
00:56:10 people understand then there's no reason to think we can't deal with this because this technological revolution is
00:56:16 arguably similar to what electricity industrial revolutions and internet brought about do you think there's a
00:56:23 role for policy for governments to step in to help with policy to create a better world absolutely and I and the
00:56:32 government's don't have to believe an employment will go up and they don't have to believe automation will be this
00:56:39 fast to do something revamping vocational school would be one example another is if there is a big gap in
00:56:47 health care service employment and we know that a country's population is is growing Oh
00:56:54 more longevity living older because people over 80 require five times as much care as those under 80 then it is a
00:57:02 good time to incent training programs for elderly care to find ways to improve the pay maybe one
00:57:10 way would be to offer as part of Medicare or the equivalent program for people over 80 to be entitled to a few
00:57:19 hours of elderly here at home and then that might be reimbursable and that will stimulate the service industry around
00:57:30 the policy do you have concerns about large entities whether it's governments or companies controlling the future of
00:57:39 AI development in general so we talked about companies do you have a better sense that governments can better
00:57:48 represent the interest of the people then companies or do you believe companies are better representing the
00:57:55 interests of the people or is there no easy answer I don't think there's an easy answer because there's a
00:57:59 double-edged sword the companies and governments can provide better services with more access
00:58:07 to data and more access to AI but that also leads to greater power which can lead to uncontrollable problems whether
00:58:16 it's monopolies or corruption in the government so I think one has to be careful to look at how much data that
00:58:25 companies and governments have and and some kind of checks and balances would be helpful so again I come from Russia
00:58:37 there's something called the Cold War so let me ask a difficult question here looking at conflict the Steven Pinker
00:58:42 written a great book that conflict all over the world is decreasing in general but do you have a sense that having
00:58:52 written the book AI superpowers do you see a major international conflict potentially arising between major
00:58:58 nations whatever they are with its roster China European nations United States or others
00:59:07 in the next 10 20 50 years around AI around the digital space cyberspace do you worry about that that is there
00:59:14 something is that something we need to think about and try to alleviate or prevent I believe in greater engagement
00:59:25 a lot of the worries about more powerful AI are based on a arms race metaphor and the when you extrapolate into military
00:59:43 kinds of scenarios AI can automate and and and you know animus weapons that needs to be controlled somehow and
00:59:52 autonomous decision-making can lead to not enough time to fix international crises so I actually believe a Cold War
01:00:01 mentality would be very dangerous because should two countries rely on AI to make certain decisions and they don't
01:00:10 in talk to each other they do their own scenario planning then something could easily go wrong
01:00:17 I think engagement interaction some protocols to avoid inadvertent disasters is actually needed so it's natural for
01:00:28 each country to want to be the best whether it's in nuclear technologies or AI or bio but I think is important to
01:00:40 realize if each country has a black box AI and that don't talk to each other that probably presents greater
01:00:49 challenges to humanity then if they interacted I think there can still be competition but with some degree of
01:00:57 protocol for interaction just like when there was a nuclear competition there were some protocol for deterrence among
01:01:09 US Russia and China and I think that engagement is needed so of course we're still far from AI presenting that kind
01:01:17 of danger but what I worry the most about is the level of engagement seems to be coming down the level of distrust seems
01:01:27 to be going up especially from the US towards other large countries such as China and of course Russia and Russia
01:01:34 yes is there a way to make that better so that's beautifully put level engagement and even just basic trust and
01:01:45 communication as opposed to sort of you know making artificial enemies out of particular particular countries did you
01:01:56 ever you have a sense how we can make it better mentionable items that as a society we can take on I'm not an expert at
01:02:07 geopolitics but I would say that we look pretty foolish as humankind when we are faced with the opportunity to create
01:02:17 sixteen trillion dollars for for Humanity and we we're in yet we're not solving fundamental problems with parts
01:02:30 of the world still in poverty and for the first time we have the resources to overcome poverty and hunger we're not
01:02:36 using it on that but we're fueling competition among superpowers and that's a very unfortunate thing if we become
01:02:47 utopian for a moment imagine a a benevolent world government that has this 16 trillion dollars and maybe some
01:02:57 AI to figure out how to use it to deal with diseases and problems and hate and things like that world would be a lot
01:03:06 better off so what is wrong with the current world I think the people with more skill than then I should just think
01:03:14 about this and then at your politics issue with superpower competition is one side of the issue there's another side
01:03:23 which I worry maybe even even even more which is as the 16 trillion dollars all gets made by US and China and a few of
01:03:31 the developed other developed countries the poorer country will get nothing because they don't have technology and
01:03:40 the the wealth disparity and the end of inequality will increase so a poor a country with a large population will not
01:03:48 only benefit from the AI pool or other technology booms but they will have their workers who previously had hoped
01:03:56 they could do the China  model and do outsourced manufacturing or the india model so they could do the house or some
01:04:03 process or call center all those jobs are going to be gone in 10 or 15 years so the the individual citizen may be a
01:04:12 net liability I mean financially speaking to a poorer country and not an asset to claw itself out of poverty so
01:04:23 in that kind of situation these large countries with was not much tech are going to be facing a downward spiral and
01:04:33 it's unclear what could be done and and then when we look back and say there's 16 trillion dollars being created and
01:04:39 it's all being kept by us China and other developed countries it just doesn't feel right so I hope people who
01:04:47 know about geopolitics can find solutions that's beyond my expertise so different countries that we've talked
01:04:55 about have different value systems if you look at the United States to an almost extreme degree there is a an
01:05:03 absolute desire for freedom of speech if you look at a country where I was raised that desire just amongst the people is
01:05:12 not that not as elevated as it is basically fundamental level to the essence of what it means to be America
01:05:19 right and the same is true with China there's different value systems and there is some censorship of Internet
01:05:29 content that China and Russia and many other countries undertake do you see that having effects on innovation other
01:05:39 aspects of some of the text of AI development we talked about and maybe from another angle do you see that changing
01:05:47 different ways over the next 10 years 20 years 50 years as China continues to grow as it does now in its tech
01:05:57 innovation there's a common belief that full freedom of speech and expression is correlated with creativity which is
01:06:08 correlated with entrepreneurial success I think empirically we have seen that is not true and China has been successful
01:06:18 that's not to say the fundamental values are not right or not the best but it's just that that that perfect correlation
01:06:27 isn't isn't there it's hard to read the tea leaves on an opening up or not in any country and I've not been very good
01:06:37 at that in my past predictions but I do believe every country shares some fundamental value a lot of fundamental
01:06:48 values for the long-term so you know China is drafting its privacy policy for individual citizens and they
01:07:00 don't look that different from the American or European ones so people do want to protect their privacy and have
01:07:12 the opportunity to express and I think the fundamental values are there the question is in the execution and timing
01:07:20 how soon or when will that start to open up so so as long as each government knows ultimately people want that kind
01:07:30 of protection there should be a plan to move towards that as to when or how and I'm not an expert on the point of
01:07:39 privacy to me it's really interesting so AI needs data to create a personalized awesome experience yeah all right I'm
01:07:46 just speaking general in terms of products and then we have currently depending on the age and depending on
01:07:53 the demographics of who we were talking about some people are more or less concerned about the amount of data they
01:08:01 handover so in your view how do we get this balance right that we provide an amazing experience to people that use
01:08:11 products you look at Facebook you know the more Facebook knows about you yes it's scary to say the better you can
01:08:20 probably yeah but experience it could probably create so any of you how do we get that balance right yes I think a lot
01:08:30 of people have a misunderstanding that it's okay and possible to just rip all the data out from a provider and give it
01:08:39 back to you so you can deny them access to further data and still enjoy the services we have if we take back all the
01:08:47 data all the services will give us nonsense will no longer be able to use products that function well in terms of
01:08:56 you know right ranking right products right user experience so so yet I do understand we don't want to permit
01:09:06 misuse of the data from legal policy and point I think there can be severe punishment for those who have egregious
01:09:18 misuse of the data that's I think a good first step actually China in this side on this
01:09:25 aspect has very strong laws about people who sell or give data to other companies and and that over the past few years
01:09:32 since the that loud locking came into effect pretty much eradicated the illegal distribution sharing of data
01:09:47 additionally I think giving I think in technology is often a very good way to solve technology misuse so can we come
01:09:56 up with new technologies that will let us have our cake and eat it too people are looking into homomorphic
01:10:04 encryption which is letting you keep the data have it encrypted and train on encrypted data of course we haven't
01:10:10 solved that one yet but that kind of direction may be worth pursuing also federated learning which would
01:10:18 allow one hospital to train on its hospital's patient data fully because they have a license for that and then
01:10:24 hospitals would then share their models not data with models to create a super AI and that also maybe has some promise
01:10:33 so I would want to encourage us to be open-minded and think this think of this as not just the policy binary yes/no but
01:10:41 letting the technologists try to find solutions to let us have our cake in either two or have most of our cake and
01:10:47 eat most of it too finally I think giving each end user a choice is important and having
01:10:56 transparency is important also I think that's universal but the choice you give to the user should not be at a granular
01:11:04 level that the user cannot understand gdpr today causes all these pop ups of yes/no will you give this site this
01:11:12 right to use this part of your data I don't think any user understands what they're saying yes or no to and I
01:11:19 suspect most are just saying yes because they don't understand so while GDP are in its current
01:11:27 implementation has lived up to its promise of transparency and user choice it implemented it in such a way that
01:11:37 really didn't deliver the the spirit of GDP our it fit the letter but not the spirit so again I think we need to think
01:11:46 about is there a way to fit the spirit of GDP our by using some kind of technology can we have a slider that's
01:11:55 an AI trying to figure out how much you want to slide between perfect protection secure security of your personal data
01:12:04 versus high degree of convenience with some risks of not having full privacy each user's should have some preference
01:12:12 and that gives you the user choice but maybe we should turn the problem on its head and ask can there be an AI
01:12:18 algorithm that can customize this because we can understand the slider but we sure cannot understand every pop up
01:12:27 question and I think getting that right requires getting the balance between what we talked about earlier which is
01:12:34 heart and soul versus profit driven decisions and strategy I think from my perspective the best way to make a lot
01:12:43 of money in the long term is to keep your heart and soul intact I think getting that slider right in the
01:12:52 short term may feel like you'll be sacrificing profit but in the long term you were beginning user trusts and
01:12:59 providing a great experience do you share that kind of view in general yes absolutely I would I sure would hope
01:13:08 there is a way we can do long term projects that's really do the right thing I think a lot of people who
01:13:16 embrace GDP are their hearts in the right place I think they just need to figure out how to build a solution I've
01:13:23 heard utopians talk about solutions that get me excited but not sure how in the current funding environment they can get
01:13:31 started right people talk about imagine this crowd-sourced data collection that we all trust and then we have these agents
01:13:44 that we ask them to ask the trusted agent to we that agent only that platform said trusted joined platform
01:13:54 that that we all believe is trustworthy that can give us all the closed-loop personal suggestions by the new social
01:14:06 network new search engine new e-commerce engine that has access to even more of our data but not directly but indirectly
01:14:15 so I think that general concepts of licenses into some trusted engine and finding a way to trust that engine seems
01:14:23 like a great idea but if you think how long it's gonna take to implement and tweak and develop it right as well as to
01:14:30 collect all the Trust's and the data from the people it's beyond the current cycle of venture capital right so how do
01:14:38 you do that it's a big question you've recently had a fight with cancer Stage four lymphoma and a in a sort of
01:14:49 deep personal level what did it feel like in the darker moments to face your own mortality well I've been the
01:14:59 workaholic my whole life and I've basically worked nine ninety six 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. six days a week
01:15:07 roughly and I didn't really pay a lot of attention to my family friends and people who loved me and my life revolved
01:15:15 around optimizing for work while my work was not routine my optimization really what made my life basically a very
01:15:26 mechanical process but I got a lot of highs out of it because of accomplishments that I thought were
01:15:34 really important and dear and the highest priority to me but when I faced mortality and the
01:15:41 possible death in a matter of months I suddenly realized that this really meant nothing to me that I didn't feel like
01:15:49 working for another minute that if I had six months left in my life I would spend it all with my loved ones and you know
01:15:57 thanking them giving them love back and apologizing to them that I lived my life the wrong way so so that moment of
01:16:07 reckoning caused me to really rethink that's why we exist in this world is is something that we might be too much
01:16:18 shaped by the society to think that success and accomplishments is why we live but while that can get you periodic
01:16:31 successes and satisfaction it's really in the facing death you see what's truly important to you so as a result of going
01:16:41 through them the challenges with cancer I've resolved to live a more balanced lifestyle I'm now in remission knock on
01:16:51 wood and I'm spending more time with my family my wife travels with me when my kids need me I spend more time with them
01:17:01 and before I used to prioritize everything around work when I had a little bit of time I would dole it out
01:17:08 to my family now when my family needs something really need something I drop everything at work and go to them and
01:17:15 then in the time remaining I allocate to work but once family is very understanding it's not like they will
01:17:22 take me 50 weeks so 50 hours a week from me so I'm actually able to still work pretty hard maybe ten hours less per
01:17:31 week so I realized the most important thing in my life is really love and the people I love and that give that the
01:17:39 highest priority it isn't the only thing I do but when that is needed I put that at the top priority and I feel much
01:17:49 better and I feel much more balanced and I think this also gives a hint as to a life of routine work a life of pursuit
01:18:01 of numbers while my job was not routine it wasn't pursuit of numbers pursuit of can I make more money can i fund more
01:18:08 great companies can I raise more money can I make sure our VC is ranked higher and higher every year this competitive
01:18:19 nature of driving for bigger numbers and better numbers became a endless pursuit of that's mechanical and bigger numbers
01:18:31 doesn't really didn't make me happier and faced with death I realized the bigger numbers really meant nothing and
01:18:39 what was important is that people who have given their heart and their love to me deserve for me to do the same there's
01:18:48 deep profound truth in that that everyone should hear and internalize and that's really powerful for you to say
01:18:59 that I have to ask sort of a difficult question here so I've competed and sports my whole
01:19:08 life looking historically I'd like to challenge some aspect of that a little bit on the point of hard work that it
01:19:18 feels that there are certain aspects that is the greatest the most beautiful aspects of human nature is the ability
01:19:29 to become obsessed of becoming extremely passionate to the point where yes flaws are revealed and just giving yourself
01:19:39 fully to a task that is in another sense you mentioned love being important but in another sense this kind of obsession
01:19:47 this pure exhibition of passion and hard work is truly what it means to be human what lessons should we take this deeper
01:19:54 because Eve accomplished incredible things you say it chasing numbers but really there's some incredible work
01:20:03 there so how do you think about that when you look back in your 20s 30s what was what would you do differently would
01:20:13 you really take back some of the incredible hard work I would but it's it's in percentages right
01:20:23 we're both computer scientists so I think when one balances one's life when when one is younger you you might give a
01:20:31 smaller percentage to family but you will still give him high priority and when you get older you would give a
01:20:37 larger percentage to them and still the high priority and and when you're near retirement you give most of it to them
01:20:44 and the highest priority so I think the key point is not that we would work 20 hours less for the whole life and just
01:20:54 spend it aimlessly with the family but that when the family has a need when your wife is having a baby when your
01:21:04 daughter has a birthday or when they're depressed or when they're celebrating something or when they have a
01:21:11 get-together or we have family time that it's important for us to put down our phone and PC and be a hundred percent
01:21:21 with them and that priority on the things that really matter isn't going to be so taxing that it would eliminate or
01:21:30 even dramatically reduce our accomplishments it might have some impact but it might also have other
01:21:37 impact because if you have a happier family maybe you fight less you fight less you don't spend time taking care of
01:21:45 all the aftermath of a fight so it's unclear that it would take more time and if it did I'd be willing to to take that
01:21:54 reduction and it's not a dramatic number but it's a number that I think would give me a greater degree of happiness
01:22:02 and knowing that I've done the right thing and still have plenty of hours to it to get the success that I want to get
01:22:12 so given the many successful companies that you've launched and much success throughout your career what advice would
01:22:24 you give to young people today King or doesn't have to be young but people today looking to launch and to
01:22:31 create the next one billion-dollar tech startup or even AI base startup I would suggest that people understand
01:22:42 technology waves move quickly what worked two years ago may not work today and that is very much case in point for
01:22:52 AI I think two years ago or maybe three years ago you certainly could say I have a couple of super-smart PhDs and we're
01:23:00 not sure what we're gonna do but here's what how we're gonna start and get funding for a very high valuation those
01:23:08 days are over because AI is going from rocket science towards mainstream not yet commodity but
01:23:13 more mainstream so first the creation of any company to eventual capitalists has to be creation
01:23:26 of business value and monetary value and when you have a very scarce commodity VCS may be willing to accept greater
01:23:36 uncertainty but now the number of people who have the equivalent of PhD three years ago because that can be learned
01:23:46 more quickly platforms are emerging the costs to become a AI engineer is much lower and there are many more AI
01:23:54 engineers so the market is different so I would suggest someone who wants to build an AI company be thinking about
01:24:01 the normal business questions what customer cases are you trying to address what kind of pain are you trying to
01:24:10 address how does that translate to value how will you extract value and get paid through what channel and how much
01:24:20 business value will get created that's today needs to be thought about much earlier upfront then it did three years ago
01:24:29 the scarcity question of AI talent has changed the number of AI talent has changed so now you need not just AI but
01:24:38 also understanding of business customer and and the marketplace so I also think you should have a more
01:24:50 reasonable valuation expectation and growth expectation there's going to be more competition but the good news
01:24:58 though is that AI technologies are now more available in open source tensorflow pi torch and such tools are much easier
01:25:09 to use so you should be able to experiment and get results iteratively faster than before so take more of a
01:25:19 business mindset to this think less of this as a laboratory taken into a company because we've gone beyond that
01:25:28 stage the only exception is if you truly have a breakthrough in some technology that really no one has then then the old
01:25:35 way still works but I think that's harder and harder now so I know you believe as many do that we're far from
01:25:42 creating an artificial general intelligence system but say once we do and you get to ask her one question what
