00:00:01 the following is a conversation with ian hutchinson a nuclear engineer and plasma physicist at mit he has made
00:00:08 a number of important contributions in plasma physics including the magnetic confinement of plasmas
00:00:15 seeking to enable fusion reactions which happens to be the energy source of the stars to be used
00:00:21 for practical energy production current nuclear reactors by the way are based on fission as we discuss
00:00:28 ian has also written on the philosophy of science and the relationship between science and religion arguing in particular
00:00:35 against scientism which is a negative description of the overreach of the scientific method
00:00:41 to questions not amenable to it on this latter topic i recommend two of his books his new one can a scientist believe in
00:00:48 miracles where he answers more than 200 questions on all aspects of god and science and his earlier book on scientism called monopolizing
00:00:58 knowledge as you may have seen already i work hard on having an open mind always questioning my assumptions and in
00:01:04 general marvel at the immense mystery of everything around us and the limitations of at least my
00:01:12 mind i'm not religious myself in that i don't go to the synagogue a church or mosque but i see the beautiful bond in the
00:01:20 community that religion at its best can create i also see both in scientists and religious leaders signs of arrogance hypocrisy
00:01:31 greed and a will to power we're human whether buddhist christian hindu jewish muslim
00:01:39 agnostic or atheist this podcast is my humble attempt to explore a complicated human nature
00:01:46 what stanislav in his book solaris called our own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers
00:01:52 i ask that you try to keep an open mind as well and be patient with the limitations of mine

00:05:30 here's my conversation with ian hutchinson maybe it'd be nice to draw a distinction between nuclear physics
00:05:37 and plasma physics what is the distinction nuclear physics is about the physics of the nucleus and
00:05:44 my department department of nuclear science and engineering at mit is very concerned about all the
00:05:49 interactions and reactions and and consequences of things that go on in the nucleus including
00:05:56 nuclear energy fission energy which is the nuclear energy that we have already
00:06:02 and fusion energy which is the energy source of the sun and stars which we don't quite know how to turn
00:06:08 into practical energy  for humankind at the moment that's what my research has mostly been
00:06:16 aimed at but plasmas are essentially the fourth state of matter so if you
00:06:24 think about solid liquid gas plasma is the fourth of those states of matter and it's
00:06:32 actually the state of matter which one reaches if one raises the temperature so cold things you know like ice are solid
00:06:43 liquids are hotter water and if you heat water beyond 100 degrees celsius it becomes gas
00:06:51  well that's true of most substances and plasma is a is a state of matter in which the electrons are
00:07:02 unbound from the nuclei so they become separated from the nuclei and can move separately so we have positively charged nuclei
00:07:11 and we have negatively charged electrons then the net is is still neutral electrically neutral
00:07:21 but a plasma conducts electricity has all sorts of important properties that are associated
00:07:27 with that separation and that's what plasmas are all about and the reason why my department is
00:07:32 interested in plasma physics very strongly is because most things well for one thing most
00:07:37 things in the universe are plasma the vast majority of matter in the universe is plasma but but most particularly
00:07:47 stars and the sun are plasmas because they're very hot and it's only in very hot states
00:07:54 that nuclear fusion reactions take place and we want to understand how to implement those kind of phenomena
00:08:01 on earth maybe another distinction we want to try to get at is a difference between
00:08:06 fission and fusion as you mentioned fusion is the kind of reaction happening in the sun so what's
00:08:11 vision and what's fusion well fission is taking heavy elements like uranium and breaking them up
00:08:20 and it turns out that that process of breaking up heavy elements releases energy what does it mean to be a heavy helmet
00:08:26 it means that there are many nuclear particles in the nucleus itself neutrons and protons in the
00:08:35 in the nucleus itself so that in the case of uranium there are 92
00:08:43 protons in each nucleus and even more neutrons so that the total number of nucleons
00:08:50 in the nucleus nucleons is short for for either a proton or a neutron the total number you know might be 235 that's
00:08:59 u235 or it might be 238 that's u238 so those are heavy elements light elements by contrast have very few
00:09:08 nucleons protons or neutrons in the nucleus hydrogen is the lightest nucleus it has one proton there are actually slightly
00:09:16 heavier forms of hydrogen isotopes deuterium has a proton and a neutron and tritium
00:09:26 has a proton and two neutrons so it has total of three nucleons in the new in the nucleus
00:09:34 well taking light elements like isotopes of hydrogen and not breaking them up but actually
00:09:40 fusing them together reacting them together to produce heavier elements typically helium okay which is helium is
00:09:48 a nucleus which has has two protons and two neutrons that also releases energy and that and
00:09:56 that or reactions like that making heavier elements from lighter elements is what mostly powers the sun and stars
00:10:08 both fusion and fission release approximately a million times more energy per unit mass than chemical reactions
00:10:17 so a chemical reaction means take hydrogen take oxygen react them together let's say and get
00:10:25 water that releases energy the energy released in a chemical reaction like that or the burning of coal or
00:10:31 on oil or whatever else is about a million times less per unit mass than what is released in
00:10:37 nuclear reactions so but it's hard to do it requires very high energy of impact
00:10:45 and actually it's very easy to understand why and that is that those two nuclei if they're both let's say
00:10:52 hydrogen nuclei one is let's say deuterium and the other is let's say tritium they're both electrically charged and so
00:10:59 the and they're positively charged so they they like charges repel everyone knows that right
00:11:05 so basically to get them close enough together to react you have to overcome the repulsion the
00:11:11 electric repulsion of the two nuclei from one another and you have to get them extremely close
00:11:19 to one another in order for the nuclear forces to overtake the electrical forces and and actually
00:11:25 form a new nucleus and so one requires very high energies of impact in order for reactions to take
00:11:32 place and those high energies of impact correspond to very high temperatures of random motion so that's why you can
00:11:40 do something like that in the sun so we can build the sun that's one way to do it
00:11:46 but  on earth how do you create a fusion reaction yeah well nature engineering nature's fusion  reactors are indeed
00:11:56 the stars and  they are very hot in the set in the center
00:12:02 and re and they reach the point where they release more energy from those reactions than they lose by radiation and
00:12:10 transport to the surface and so forth and that's a state of ignition and and that's what we have to achieve to
00:12:20 to give net energy it's like lighting a fire if you if you have a if you have a bundle of sticks and you hold a match up
00:12:25 to it and you see smoke coming from the sticks but you take the match away and the
00:12:33 and the and the sticks just fizzle out that's not the reason they did it fizzled out is
00:12:37 that yes they were burning there was smoke coming from them but they were not ignited
00:12:42 but if you are able to take the match away and they keep burning and they are generating enough heat
00:12:48 to keep themselves hot and hence keep the reactions going that's chemical ignition well what we
00:12:54 need to do what the stars do in order to generate nuclear fusion energy is
00:13:04 they are ignited they are generated enough energy to keep themselves hot and that's what we've got to do on earth
00:13:10 if we're going to make fusion work on earth but it's much harder to do
00:13:19 on earth than it is you know in a star because you know we need temperatures of order tens of millions of
00:13:28 degrees celsius in order for the reactions to go fast enough to generate enough
00:13:33 electricity to keep it or enough energy to keep it going and and so if you've got something that's
00:13:42 tens of millions of degrees celsius and you want to keep it all together and keep the heat in long enough
00:13:49 to have enough reactions taking place you can't just put it in a bottle you know plastic or glass it would be
00:13:54 gone you know it's in milliseconds so you have to have some non-material
00:14:05 mechanism of confining the plasma in the case of stars that non-material force is gravity so gravity is what holds a
00:14:13 star together it's what holds the plasma in long enough for it to react
00:14:20 and and and sustain itself by the the fusion reactions but on earth gravity is extremely weak i mean i don't
00:14:27 mean to say we don't fall yes we fall but the the mutual gravitational attraction of small objects is very weak compared
00:14:37 with the electrical repulsion or any other force that you can think about on earth and so we need a stronger force
00:14:46 to keep the plasma together to confine it and the predominant attempt at making fusion work on earth is to use
00:14:55 magnetic fields to confine the plasma and that's what i've worked on for much
00:15:01 essentially most of my career is to understand how we can and how best we can confine these incredibly hot gases plasmas using
00:15:12 magnetic fields with the ultimate objective of releasing fusion energy on earth and you know generating electricity with it
00:15:21 and powering our society with it a dumb question so on top of the magnetic fields
00:15:27 do you also need the plastic water bottle walls or is it purely magnetic fields well actually what we do need walls
00:15:36 those walls must be kept away from the plasma because otherwise they'd be melted or the plasma must be kept away
00:15:40 from them inside inside of them but the main purpose of the walls
00:15:47 is not to keep the plasma in it's to keep the atmosphere out so if we want to do it on earth where
00:15:53 there's air we want the plasma to consist of hydrogen isotopes or other things the
00:15:59 things we're trying to react and by the way the density of those plasmas at least in magnetic
00:16:06 confinement fusion is very low it's maybe a million times less than the density of air in this room
00:16:16 so in order for a fusion reactor like that to work you have to keep all of the air out and
00:16:21 just keep the plasma in so yes there are other things but those are things that are relatively
00:16:26 easy i mean making a vacuum these days is technologically quite quite straightforward we know how to do that
00:16:32 okay what we don't quite know how to do is to make a confinement  device that
00:16:39 isolates the plasma well enough so that it so that it's able to keep itself burning with its own reaction
00:16:45 so maybe can you talk about what a takamaka is the russian acronym from which the word
00:16:52 tokamak is built just means toroidal magnetic chamber so it's a toroidal chamber taurus is
00:16:59 is a geometric shape which is like a doughnut with a hole down the middle okay and so it's the so it's the meat of
00:17:04 the doughnut okay that's the taurus and it's and it's got a magnetic field so that's
00:17:12 really all takamak  means but the particular configuration that we're the that is very
00:17:21 widespread and there's the sort of best prospect in the least in the near term for making fusion energy work
00:17:28 is one in which there's a very strong magnetic field the the long way around the
00:17:35 doughnut around the torus so you've got to imagine that there's this doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic
00:17:41 field just going round and round the long way the the big advantage of that is that plasma particles
00:17:52 are when they're in a in the presence of a magnetic field feel strong forces from the magnetic
00:17:58 field and those forces make the particles gyrate around the direction of the magnetic field line so basically
00:18:09 the particles follow helical orbits like like a following like a spring that's directed along the magnetic field
00:18:15 well if you make the magnetic field go in inside this toroidal chamber and just simply go round and round the chamber
00:18:24 then because of this helical orbit the particles can't move fast across the magnetic field
00:18:31 but they can move very quickly along the magnetic field and if you have a magnetic field that
00:18:37 doesn't leave the chamber it doesn't matter if they move along the magnetic field it does
00:18:42 it means it doesn't mean they're going to exit the chamber but if you just had a straight magnetic
00:18:47 field as you you know for example coming from you know a bar a helmholtz coil or
00:18:54 or a bar magnet then you'd have to have ends it would come would come to the end ends of the chamber somewhere in the and
00:19:00 the particles would hit the ends and and they would lose their energy so that's why it's toroidal
00:19:06 and that's why we have a strong magnetic field it's providing a confinement against motion
00:19:14 in the in the direction that would lead the particles to leave the chamber it turns out that then here we're
00:19:20 getting a little bit technical but it turns out that a toroidal field alone is not enough and
00:19:24 so you need more fields to produce true true confinement of plasma and we get those by passing a
00:19:31 current as well through the plasma itself i can make sure it stays on track
00:19:36 well that what that does is makes the field lines themselves into much bigger helices and
00:19:42 that for reasons that are too complicated to explain that clinches the confinement of the particles
00:19:50 at least in terms of their single particle orbits so they don't leave the chamber and so when the particles are flying
00:19:56 along this  this this doughnut the inside of the donut  are they what's where's the
00:20:03 generation of the energy coming from are they smashing into each other yeah eventually i mean
00:20:09 in a fusion reactor there will be deuterons and triti and tritons and they will be
00:20:15 smashing in they will be very hot they'll be 100 million degrees celsius or something so they're moving
00:20:21 thermally with very large thermal energies in random directions and they will collide with one another
00:20:28 and have fusion reactions when those fusion reactions take place energy is released large amounts of
00:20:33 energy is released in the form of particles one of the particles that's released is an alpha particle which is also charged
00:20:40 and it's also confined and that alpha particle stays in the in the in the doughnut and heats the other
00:20:46 particles that are in that doughnut so it transfers its energy to those and they it keeps them hot
00:20:52 there's there's some leaking of heat all the time a little bit of radiation some transport and so forth there's also
00:20:58 a neutron released from that reaction the neutron carries out four-fifths of the fusion energy
00:21:03 and that will have to be captured in a blanket that surrounds the chamber in which we
00:21:12 take the energy drive some kind of electrical generator from you know thermal thermal engine
00:21:23 gas turbine or something like that and power the power you got energy so where do we stand where do we stand on
00:21:32 getting this thing to be  something that actually works it generates energy yep well there have been experiments that
00:21:39 have generated net nuclear energies or nuclear powers in the vicinity of
00:21:47 you know a few tens of megawatts for a few seconds so that's you know 10 megajoules that's not much energy
00:21:56 it's a few doughnuts worth of energy okay yeah literal donut that's right um
00:22:06 but but we have studied how well tokamax can confine plasmas and so we now understand in in rather great detail
00:22:15 the way they work and we're able to predict what is going to be required in order to build a
00:22:22 tokamak that becomes self-sustaining that that becomes essentially ignited or very so close to ignited that it
00:22:29 doesn't matter and and at the moment at least if you use the modest magnetic field
00:22:39 values still very strong but but limited limited magnetic field values you have to build a very big device and
00:22:51 worldwide fusion research is at the moment in the process of building a very big experiment
00:22:57 that's located in the south of france it's called eta i-t-e-r which means the way or
00:23:03 just means the international tokamak experimental reactor if you like and that experiment is designed to
00:23:12 reach this burning plasma state and to generate about 500 megawatts of fusion power
00:23:21 for hundreds of seconds at a time it'll still only be an experiment it won't put electricity
00:23:27 on the grid or anything like that it's it's to figure out what whether it works and and with what the remaining
00:23:34 engineering challenges are it's a scientific experiment it won't be engineered to run round the
00:23:39 clock and and so on and so forth which ultimately one one needs to do
00:23:43 in order to make something that's practical for generating electricity but it will be the first demonstration
00:23:49 on earth of a controlled fusion reaction reaction for you know long time time periods is
00:23:57 that exciting to you  it it it's been an objective that is in many ways motivated my entire career
00:24:06 and the career career of many people like me in the field i have to admit though
00:24:14 that one of the problems with eta is that it's an extremely big and expensive and long time to build experiment and so it
00:24:23 won't even come into operation until about 2025 even though it's been being built for
00:24:30 10 years and it's been it was designed for 30 years before that right and so that's actually one of the
00:24:38 big disappointments of my career in a certain sense which is that we won't get to
00:24:45 a burning fusion reaction until well past the first operation of eater and whether i'm alive
00:24:50 or not i don't know but i certainly will be well and truly retired by the time that happens
00:24:57 and so when i realized maybe some years ago that that was going to be the case it was a discouragement to me let's put
00:25:03 it like that but if we can try to look maybe in a ridiculous kind of way look into 
00:25:11 100 years from now 200 years 500 years from now and we you know there's folks like elon
00:25:17 musk  trying to  travel outside the solar system i mean the amount of energy we need for
00:25:21 some of the exciting things we want to do in this world if we look again 100 years from now
00:25:29  seems to be a very large amount so do you think fusion energy will eventually  sometime into your retirement 
00:25:39 will be basically  behind most of the things we do look i absolutely think that fusion research is
00:25:47 completely justified in fact we should be spending more time and effort on it than we currently do
00:25:55 but it isn't going to be a magic bullet that somehow solves all the problems of energy by the
00:26:01 way that's a generic statement you can make about any energy source in my view i think
00:26:06 it's a grave mistake to think that science of any sort is suddenly going to find a magic bullet for meeting all the energy
00:26:13 needs of society or any of the other needs of society by the way but and we can talk about that hopefully later
00:26:22 but but but but fusion is very worthwhile and we should be doing it and and so my disappointment
00:26:30 that i just expressed was in a certain sense of personal disappointment i do think that fusion energy is a
00:26:37 terrific challenge it's very difficult to bring the energy source of the sun and stars
00:26:42 down to earth this does contrast in a certain sense with fission energy by contrast fission energy
00:26:51 efficient to build a fission reactor proved to be amazingly easy you know we did it within a few years
00:27:00 of discovering nuclear fission people had figured out how to build a reactor and did so
00:27:07 you know during the second world war which is by the way fission is how the current nuclear power
00:27:11 plants work yeah and so we have  nuclear energy today because fission  reactors are
00:27:20 relatively easy to build you've got to have what's hard is getting the materials okay and that's just as
00:27:26 well because if everyone could get those materials you know there would be weapons proliferation and so forth
00:27:34 but it wasn't all that long after even the discovery of nuclear fission that fission reactors were built and
00:27:41 fission reactors of course operated before we had weapons so um
00:27:49 i think nuclear power is obviously important to meet the energy challenges of our
00:27:59 age it is completely intrinsically completely  co2 emissions free and in fact the wastes that come from
00:28:08 nuclear power whether it's fission or fusion for that matter are so moderate in quantity
00:28:16 that that we shouldn't really be worried about them i mean yes fission products are
00:28:21 highly radioactive and and we need to keep them away from people but there's so little of them
00:28:26 it's that keeping them away from people is not particularly difficult and so while people complain a lot about the
00:28:35 the drawbacks of fish and energy i think most of those complaints are ill-informed we can talk about you know the the
00:28:42 challenges and the disasters if you like of  off of fission reactors but i think fission in the near term offers a
00:28:51 terrific opportunity for environmentally friendly energy which in which in the world as a whole
00:28:58 is rapidly being taken advantage of you know China  and india and places like that
00:29:03 are rapidly building fission plants we're not rapidly building fission plants in the u.s although we are actually
00:29:09 building two at the moment two new ones but we do still get 20 of our electricity from fish and
00:29:18 energy and we could get a lot more so it's clean energy so it's clean energy now
00:29:23 now again the concern is there's a very popular hbo show and just came out on chernobyl  there's the three mile island there's
00:29:31 fukushima that's the most recent disaster so there's a kind of a concern of yeah i mean nuclear disasters
00:29:39 is that what do you make of that kind of  concern especially if we look into the future of fission energy based  reactors
00:29:46 well first of all let me say one or two words about the contrast between fission and fusion and then we'll come on to the
00:29:50 question of the disasters and so forth fission does have some drawbacks and they're
00:29:58 and they're largely to do with four four main areas one is do we have enough uranium or other
00:30:05 fissile fuels to to supply our energy needs for a long time the answer to that is that we know we have
00:30:14 enough uranium to support fission energy worldwide for thousands of years but maybe not for millions of years okay
00:30:26 so that's resources secondly there there are issues to do with wastes fission wastes
00:30:32 are highly radioactive and some of them are volatile and so for example in
00:30:40 fukushima the the problem was that some fraction of the fish and waste were volatilized
00:30:48 and went out as a cloud and and polluted air areas with cesium 137 strontium 90 and things like that
00:30:57 so that's a challenge of fission there's a problem of safety  beyond that and that is
00:31:07 that in fission it's hard to turn the reactor off when you turn when you stop the nuclear reactions
00:31:13 there is still a lot of heat being liberated from the fission products and that is actually what the problem
00:31:20 was at fukushima the fukushima reactors were shut down the moment that the earthquake took place
00:31:30 and they were shut down safely what then happened after that fukushima was you know there were there was this enormous
00:31:39 tidal wave many tens of meters high that came through and destroyed the electricity
00:31:47 grid feed to the fukushima reactors and their cooling was then turned off and it was the after heat
00:31:54 of the turned off reactors that eventually caused the problems that led to release and so that so that is
00:32:01 that's a safety concern and then and then finally there's a problem of proliferation and that is that fission reactors need
00:32:09 fissile fuel and the technologies for producing the under enriching and so forth the fuels can be
00:32:17 used can be can be by by bad actors to generate the materials needed for
00:32:25 a nuclear weapon and that's a very very serious concern so those are the four problems
00:32:32 fusion has major advantages in respect of all of those problems it has more  longer term fuel resources
00:32:43 it has far more benign waste issues the react the radioactivity from fusion reactions is at least a hundred
00:32:49 times less than it is from fission reactions it has no none essentially none of this after heat problem because it doesn't
00:32:58 produce fission products that are highly radioactive and generating their own heat
00:33:03 when it's turned off in fact the hard part of fusion is turning it on not turning it off
00:33:09 and and finally you don't need the same  fission technology to do to make  fusion work and so it
00:33:16 there it's got terrific advantages from the point of view of proliferation control so those are the those are four main
00:33:25 issues which make fusion seem attractive technologically because they address some of the problems of fission energy
00:33:33 i don't mean to say that fission energy is overwhelmingly problematic but clearly there have been catastrophes
00:33:41 associated with fission reactors fukushima actually is i think in many ways often overstated as a disaster because
00:33:48 after all nobody was killed by the reactors essentially zero and that's in the context
00:33:58 of a disaster a tsunami that killed between 15 and 20 000 people instantaneous more or less instantaneously
00:34:09 so you know in the scale of risks one should take the view that  in my in my in my estimation that um
00:34:18 fission energy came out of that looking pretty good okay of course that's not the popular
00:34:23 conception okay yes that's gonna i mean with a lot of things that threaten our well-being
00:34:30 we seem to be very  bad  users of data we seem to be very scared of
00:34:36  shark attacks and not at all scared of car accidents and this kind of miscalculation and
00:34:43 i think from everything and i understand  nuclear energy efficient based energy goes into that category
00:34:48 it's one of the safest one of the cleanest forms of energy and yet the pr 
00:34:55 whoever does the pr for nuclear energy is not  has a hard job ahead of them at the
00:35:00 moment well i think part of that is their association with nuclear weapons right because when you say the word
00:35:05 nuclear people don't instantly think about nuclear energy they think about nuclear weapons
00:35:11 and and so there is you know perhaps a natural tendency to do that but yes i agree with you people are very
00:35:19 poor at estimating risks and they react emotionally not rationally in most of these situations
00:35:25 can we talk about nuclear weapons just for a little bit so fission is the kind of reaction
00:35:31 that's central to the nuclear weapons we have today that's what sets them off that's what
00:35:36 sets them off so if we look at the hydrogen bomb maybe you can say how these different
00:35:42 weapons work so the earliest nuclear weapons the the nuclear bombs that were dropped on
00:35:47 japan etc etc were pure fission weapons they used  enriched uranium or plutonium
00:35:57 and their energy is essentially entirely derived from fission reactions but it was early realized that more energy
00:36:06 was available if one could somehow combine a fission bomb with fusion reactions
00:36:19 because the fusion reactions give more energy per unit mass than than fission reactions and these were
00:36:28 this was called the super you might have heard of the expression the super or more simply
00:36:35 hydrogen bombs okay bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and the fusion reactions associated with them
00:36:41 like you said it's hard to turn on it's hard to turn on because you need very high temperatures
00:36:48 and you need confinement of that long enough for the reactions to take place and so a bomb
00:36:54 actually a thermonuclear bomb a chemical implosion which then sets off a fission
00:37:12 explosion which then sets off and compresses hydrogen isotopes and other things which i don't know
00:37:19 because i don't i've never had a security clearance okay so i so i can't betray any
00:37:26 secrets about weapons because i've never been a party to them but because i know a lot about this problem
00:37:34 can guess okay and sets off fusion reactions in the middle okay so that's basically
00:37:39 it's that sequence of things which produce these enormous you know multi-megaton  bombs that
00:37:47 have very large yields and so fusion alone can't get can't get you there
00:37:55 it is actually possible to set off or to try to set off little fusion bombs alone without the
00:38:05 surrounding fission explosion and that is what is called laser fusion so another approach to fusion which
00:38:12 actually is mostly researched in the weapons complex the national labs and so forth
00:38:22 because it's more associated with the technology of of weapons is inertial fusion so if if you decide
00:38:28 instead of trying to make your plasma just sit there in this taurus in the in the
00:38:33 tokamak and be controlled steady state with a magnetic field if you if you're willing
00:38:39 to accept that i'll just set off an explosion okay and then i'll gather the energy from that
00:38:45 somehow i don't quite know how but let's not ask that question too much then it is possible
00:38:55 to imagine generating fusion alone explosions and and the way you do it is you take
00:39:03 some small amount of deuterium tritium fuel you bombard it with energy from all sides and this is what the lasers are used for
00:39:11 extremely powerful at lasers which compresses the pe the pelleted fusion and heats it it compresses it to such a high
00:39:20 density and temperature that the reactions take place very very quickly and in fact they can take place so
00:39:24 quickly that they're it's all over with before the thing flies apart
00:39:29 wow and that is heated up really fast that is inertial fusion okay is that useful for
00:39:37 energy generation not yet i mean there are those people who think it will be but you may have heard of the
00:39:43 big experiment called the national ignition facility which was built at livermore starting
00:39:49 in the late 1990s and has been in operation since around about 2010. it was designed
00:39:56 in with the claim that it would reach ignition fusion ignition in this pulsed form where the reactions
00:40:02 have got over with so quickly before the thing whole thing flies apart it didn't actually reach
00:40:07 ignition and i doesn't look as if it will although you know we never know maybe people figure
00:40:14 out how to make it work better but the answer is in principle it seems possible to reach ignition in this way maybe not
00:40:22 with that particular laser facility are you surprised that  we humans haven't destroyed ourselves given
00:40:31 that we've invented such powerful tools of destruction like what do you make of the the fact
00:40:37 that for many decades we've had nuclear weapons now speaking about estimating risk
00:40:43 at least to me it's exceptionally surprising i was born in the soviet union that that big egos
00:40:52 of the big leaders when rubbing up against each other have not created  the kind of destruction
00:40:58 one was everybody was afraid of for decades well i must say i'm extremely thankful that it hasn't i don't know whether i'm
00:41:05 surprised about it i've never thought about it from the point of view of
00:41:10 is it surprising that we've we've avoided it i'm just very thankful that we have i think that there
00:41:16 is a sense in which cooler heads have prevailed at crucial moments i think there is also
00:41:22 a sense in which you know mutually assured destruction has in fact worked as
00:41:31 a policy to restrain the great powers from going to war and in fact you know the the the fact that we haven't had
00:41:44 a world war you know since the 1940s is perhaps even attributable to nuclear weapons in a kind of strange and
00:41:55 peculiar way but i think humans are deeply  flawed and sinful people and i certainly don't
00:42:04 feel gap that we're guaranteed that it's going to go on like this and we'll talk about the sort of the
00:42:09 biggest picture view of it all  but let me just ask in terms of your worries of if we look 100 years from now we're
00:42:18 in the middle of what is now a natural pandemic that from the looks of it
00:42:26 it fortunately is not as bad as it could have possibly been if you look at the spanish flu if you look at the history
00:42:30 of pandemics if you look at all the possible pandemics that could have been that that
00:42:35 folks like bill gates are exceptionally terrified about we've  i know many people are suffering
00:42:43  but it's it's it's better than it could have been  so and now we're talking about nuclear
00:42:48 weapons in terms of existential threats to us as sinful humans  what worries you the most
00:42:58 is it nuclear weapons is is it natural pandemics engineered pandemics nanotechnology in my field of artificial
00:43:05 intelligence some people are afraid of  killer robots and robots yeah
00:43:11 is there do you think in those existential terms  and and do any aspect do any of those
00:43:18 things worry you i am certainly not confident that my children and grandchildren will
00:43:27 experience the benefits of civilization that i have enjoyed i think it's possible for our civilizations to break down
00:43:36 catastrophically i also think that it's possible for our civilizations to break down
00:43:45 progressively and i think they will if we continue to have the explosion of population on the planet that we
00:43:51 currently have i mean it's quite it's quite wrong to think of our problems as mostly
00:43:58 being co2 if we can just solve co2 then we can go on having this you know continually
00:44:05 expanding economy everywhere in the world of course you can't do that okay
00:44:11 i mean there is a finite you know bearing capacity of our planet on the resources of our planet on the
00:44:17 resources of our planet and and we can't continue to do that so i think there are lots of technical reasons
00:44:25 why a continually expanding economy and and  and civilization is impossible and therefore um
00:44:35 actually i'm as much nervous about the fact that our population is eight billion or something
00:44:39  right now worldwide as i am about the fact that you know a few million people would be
00:44:46 would be killed by covet 19. i mean i don't want to be callous about this but from the big
00:44:54 picture it seems like that's much more of a problem overpopulation people not dying is ultimately more of a problem
00:45:05  than people dying so you know that probably sounds incredibly callousy or to listeners but i think it's simply you
00:45:13 know a sober assessment of the situation is there is there ways from the way those eight billion or seven
00:45:20 billion or whatever the number is live that could make it sustainable  you know because you've kind of
00:45:27 implied there's a kind of  we have especially in the west this kind of capitalist view of 
00:45:33 really consuming a lot of resources is there a way to like if you could change  one thing or
00:45:38 a few things what would you change to make this life make it look more likely that your grandchildren have
00:45:49 a better life than you well okay so let's talk a bit about energy because that's something i know a lot a lot
00:45:54 about having thought about it most of my career in order to reach a steady-state co2 level okay that's acceptable in terms of
00:46:03 global climate change and so on and so forth we need to reduce our carbon emissions by at least a factor of
00:46:12 10 worldwide okay what's more you know the average
00:46:20 energy consumption and hence co2 emission of people in the world is less than a tenth of what we
00:46:30 per capita of than what we have in the west in america and europe and so forth so if you have in mind some utopia in
00:46:36 the future where we can where we've reached a sustainable use of energy and we've also reached
00:46:45 a situation in which there's far less inequity in the world in the sense that people have
00:46:52 share the energy resources more uniformly then what what that is equivalent to would be to reduce
00:47:01 the co2 emissions in western economies not by a factor of 10 but by a factor of 100 in other words
00:47:07 has to go down to one percent of what it is now okay yeah so you know when people talk about
00:47:14  you know let's use natural gas because you know maybe it only uses 60 of the energy of coal
00:47:20 it's complete nonsense we that's not not even scratching the surface of what we would need to do so you know is that
00:47:27 going to be feasible i i i very much doubt it and therefore i actually doubt that we
00:47:34 can reach a level of energy of fossil energy use that is one percent
00:47:45 of the current use in the west without totally dramatic changes either in you know our society our use of of
00:47:53 energy and so forth which actually of course is much of that energy is used for producing food and so on and so
00:47:58 forth so it's actually not so obvious that we can we can get we can cut down our energy usage by that factor
00:48:06 or we've got to reduce the human population population so you run up against that number that's
00:48:13 and you don't think that could be it's depressing no it's not  it's not it's not it's not depressing
00:48:19 it's it's difficult like many truths are  do you do you have a hope  that there
00:48:30 could be a technological solution in short no there is no technological solution to for example for population control i
00:48:38 mean we have the technology just you know to prevent ourselves bearing children that's not a problem
00:48:45 technology's in okay solved the challenge is society the challenges human choices the challenges almost entirely
00:48:56 human and sociological not technology not technology and when people thought talk about energy they
00:49:02 they think that there's some kind of technological magic bullet for this but there isn't
00:49:07 okay and and there isn't for the reasons i just mentioned not because it's obvious there isn't but
00:49:11 actually there isn't  and and in in any case that it's true of energy it's true of
00:49:19 pollution it's true of human population it's true of most of the big challenges in our society
00:49:26 are not scientific or technological challenges they're human sociological challenges and that's why i think it's a terrible mistake
00:49:36 even for folks like me who work at you know well the high temple of science and technology
00:49:43 in in america and maybe in the galaxy yeah i mean you know it's it's it's mit it's mit
00:49:49 best university in the world it's it's a terrible mistake if we give the impression
00:49:55 that technology is going to solve it all technology will make tremendous contributions and i think
00:50:01 it's it's worth working on it but it's a disaster if you think it's going to solve all of our problems and
00:50:08 and actually you know i've written a whole book about the question of of scientism and the and
00:50:13 the over emphasis on science both as a way of of solving problems
00:50:19 through technology but also as a way of gaining knowledge i think it's not all of the knowledge there is either
00:50:24 yeah i think that book and  your journey there is fascinating so maybe you can go there can
00:50:32 can you tell me about your on a personal side your the personal journey of your faith of
00:50:38 christianity and your relationship with  with god with religion in general yeah in my in my latest book  can a
00:50:46 scientist believe in miracles i i i give a first i devote most of the first chapter to telling how
00:50:54 how i became a christian why i became a christian i i didn't grow up as a christian which is
00:50:59 fascinating i mean you didn't grow up as a christian so you you've discovered the beauty of  god
00:51:05 and physics at the same time that's a very poetic way of putting it but yes i would accept that
00:51:11 i became a christian when i was an undergraduate at cambridge university i i had you know i had gone to a
00:51:17 school in which there was religion kind of was part of the society there were prayers and
00:51:24 at the at the at the daily you know gathering of the of the students  the assembly of the
00:51:29 students but i but i didn't really believe it i just sort of went along with it and it wasn't particularly
00:51:35 you know aggressive or benign you know blind it just sort of was there but i didn't believe it i didn't
00:51:43 didn't make much sense to me but when i but i came across christians from time to time and when i went to cambridge university
00:51:51 two of my closest friends who turned out were christians and i think it was that
00:51:57 was the most important influence on me that that here were  two people who were really smart like me
00:52:09 i i'm giving you my yeah my impression at the time the way i the way i felt at the time um
00:52:17 and and they thought christianity made sense and and you know testified to its significance in their
00:52:23 lives and so that was a very important influence on me
00:52:31 and i and ultimately i mean the reason i i i hadn't i hadn't i didn't see christianity as some kind of great evil
00:52:37 the way it's sometimes portrayed by the by the radical atheists of this century i mean i think that's nonsense but
00:52:43 but but i so i think there were certain attractive things if you go to a university like cambridge you know
00:52:48 you're surrounded by by by western culture you know from from about you know the 15th century onwards and
00:52:56 that saturated with christian art and architecture and so forth and so it's hard it's hard
00:53:05 not to recognize that christianity is in fact the foundation of western society in western culture
00:53:13 well western civilization so so i i mean maybe i was in that sense favorably disposed towards christianity as a
00:53:21 religion but as a personal faith it didn't mean anything to me but i became convinced really of two things one is that
00:53:30 the evidence for the resurrection of jesus christ is actually rather good i mean it's not a proof it's not kind of
00:53:37 some some kind of scientific demonstrate or mathematical demonstration but it's actually extremely good it's
00:53:42 not scientific evidence by and large it's historical evidence historical evidence yeah
00:53:47 so that was one thing and the other thing that came to me when i was at cambridge it
00:53:52 became clear that christianity ultimately is not theory or philosophy or something like that
00:54:06 it is or elite or at least it claims to be a personal relationship with god which
00:54:11 is made possible you know by what jesus did and on the cross and
00:54:17 and his life and his teaching and and it's a personal call to a relationship with god and
00:54:24 that had i'd never thought of it in those terms when i was you know when i was younger and that that that
00:54:29 thought became attractive to me i mean i i think most people find the person of christ
00:54:37 and his teachings you know compelling insert in a certain sense what do you mean by personal do you mean personal
00:54:43 for you like a relationship like it's a meditative like you specifically you even have a connection  with god 
00:54:52 and and then the other side you say personal with the actual body the person of jesus christ
00:54:59 so all of those things what do you mean by personal connection and why that was me well so as well for the stupid question
00:55:07 no that's okay no problem as a christian i believe that i have a relationship with god
00:55:12 which is best expressed by saying that it's personal and that comes about because you know
00:55:25 reconciled me with god me a sinner me someone full of of of of sins of of failings of ways in which
00:55:34 i don't live up to even my own ideals let alone the ideals of a holy god have been reconciled to the creator of everything
00:55:46 and and so christians myself included believe that prayer is in a certain sense a connection with god
00:55:54 and there are times when i have felt you know that god spoke to me i don't mean necessarily
00:55:59 orally in words but showed me things or enlightened me or inspired me
00:56:06 in ways that i i attribute to him so i see it as a as a two-way you know relationship in a
00:56:16 certain sense of course it's a very asymmetrical relationship but nevertheless christians think that it's
00:56:20 a two-way it's a two-way street we're not just talking into the air when we
00:56:26 say we want i'm going to pray for someone in this two-way communication  is there a way that you could try to
00:56:34 describe on a podcast what is god what is god like if if you try to describe is it a force
00:56:48 is it a is it  for you intellectually is a set of metaphors that you use to reason
00:56:56 about the world is it is it  is it is it kind of a computer that does some computation that's the
00:57:03 infinitely powerful computer  or is it like santa claus a guy with a with a beard
00:57:09 on the cloud like  i don't mean i don't mean what god actually is i mean in your limited
00:57:16  cognitive capacity as a human what do you actually  what do you find helpful for thinking of what god
00:57:22 actually looks like what is god well let me start by saying none of the above okay
00:57:29 i mean clearly god in the christian god  the god of abraham isaac and jacob etc it is is not any of those things
00:57:39 because all of those things you just mentioned are phenomena or or or entities in the created world and the
00:57:48 most fundamental thing about monotheism as you know abraham and moses and so forth handed it down
00:57:59 is that god is not an entity within the creation within the universe that god is the creator of it all
00:58:05 and that's what genesis first two chapters of genesis is really about it's it's not it's not about telling us
00:58:12 you know how god created the world it's about telling us and telling the early hebrews that
00:58:17 god created the world okay and that therefore he is not you know simply an entity within
00:58:24 it on the other hand you know our finite minds have a pretty hard time encompassing that so
00:58:32 so one has to therefore work in terms of metaphors and images and and so forth and um
00:58:40 i think we would know very little about who god is if we if it was simply  if we were simply left to our own devices
00:58:49 you know if if we were just you know here you are you're in the universe try to figure out who who made it and 
00:58:55 and so forth well you know philosophers think they can do a little bit of that maybe  and
00:58:59 theologians think that they can do a little bit more but but christians think
00:59:06  that god has actually helped us along a lot by revealing himself and and we say
00:59:14 that he's revealed himself supremely in the person of jesus christ and so you know when jesus says to
00:59:21 his disciples if you've seen me you've seen the father then that is in a certain sense a watch
00:59:28 word for answering this question for christians it is that supremely if we want to help ourselves understand who god really is
00:59:38 we look to jesus we look to what he did we look to what he said  and so forth um
00:59:45 and we believe that he is one with the father and that's why we believe you know in the trinity i mean
00:59:53 it's basically because that revelation is extremely central to christian belief and teaching
01:00:03 so in that in that sense through jesus there was that's kind of a historical moment that's profound that's really powerful
01:00:09 but do you also think that god makes himself seen in less obvious ways
01:00:18 in our world today absolutely absolutely i mean it's it's certainly been the outlook of um
01:00:29 jews and christians throughout history that god is seen in the creation that we when we look at the creation
01:00:38 we see to some extent the wonder the majesty the might of the person or the entity but the person who created it
01:00:49 and and that's a way in which scientists particularly  have over over the ages and certainly over most of the last five
01:00:58 centuries since the scientific revolution scientists have seen in a certain sense the hand of god
01:01:06 in creation i mean this leads us perhaps to a different discussion but i mean
01:01:12 it's it's remarkable to me how influential christianity and religion in generally has been
01:01:21 in science yeah most of the scientists through history as if you described i mean god has been a very
01:01:26 big part of their life and they were certainly up until the beginning of the 20th century that was
01:01:32 the case so maybe this is a good time to can you tell me what scientism is
01:01:38 yeah i mean the short answer is that's by scientism we me we mean the belief that science is
01:01:46 all the real knowledge there is and that's a shorthand there are lots of different facets of it and what which
01:01:52 one can explore and the book in which i explored it most most thoroughly was actually
01:01:58 an earlier book called monopolizing knowledge and and the the purpose of that title is to is to draw
01:02:05 attention to the fact that in our society as a whole in particular in the west today we
01:02:14 we have grown so reliant on science that we that we tend to put aside other ways of getting
01:02:21 to know things and so of course at mit we are focused on science and we do
01:02:30 focus on it very much but the truth is that there are many ways of getting to know things
01:02:37 in our world know things reliably in our world and a lot of them are not science so scientism in my view is a terrible
01:02:45 intellectual error it's to be it's the belief that somehow the methods of science as we've developed them with ex
01:02:52 you know experiments and and in the end they it relies particularly upon reproducibility in the world
01:02:59 and on a kind of clarity that comes from measurements and mathematics and related types of of skills those powerful though they
01:03:11 are for finding out about the world are not all the knowledge do not give us all the knowledge we
01:03:17 we have and there's many other forms of knowledge and the illustration that i usually use to to try to help people to think about
01:03:26 this is to say well look let's think about human history i mean to what extent can
01:03:31 human history be discovered scientifically the answer is essentially it can't
01:03:36 because and the reason is because human history is not reproducible you can't do reproducible experiments or observations and
01:03:43 and go back and you know try it over again it's it's a one-off thing you know the
01:03:49 history is full of unique events and and so you you know you you you can't hope to do history
01:03:57 using the methods of science yeah i mean in in some sense history is a story of miracles i mean
01:04:02 they don't have to have to do with god it's just uniqueness is anyway unique events
01:04:09 these unique events and  that science doesn't like that because it's  unique events but they're very
01:04:13 definition or not reproducible can i ask sort of a tricky question i don't even know what
01:04:22 atheist or atheism is but is it possible for somebody to be an atheist and avoid
01:04:29 slipping into scientism oh yeah absolutely i mean i mean there the these are two separate things okay
01:04:37 i'm quite sure there are many people who don't believe in god and yet recognize that there are many different
01:04:42 ways of we get knowledge you know some is history some is sociology economics
01:04:49 politics philosophy art history  language literature et cetera et cetera there are
01:04:56 many people who recognize those disciplines as having their own approaches to epistemology and to
01:05:03 get how we get knowledge and valuing them very highly i don't mean to say that everyone you know who's an atheist
01:05:13 automatically you know subscribes to scientific viewpoint that's not true but it's certainly the case that many of the
01:05:22 arguments in fact most of the arguments of the aggressive atheists of this century people are sometimes called new
01:05:29 atheists although they're actually rather old most of their arguments are rather old
01:05:33 you know are drawing heavily on scientism so when they say things like
01:05:40 there's no evidence to support christianity okay what they are really focusing on is to say
01:05:49 is saying that christianity isn't proved or the evidence for christianity is not science okay science doesn't prove it
01:05:58 and and you you know if you read their books that's what you find they really mean is science doesn't lead you necessarily
01:06:07 to believe in a creator god or into in any particular in religion i accept that that's not a
01:06:14 problem to me because i don't think that science is all the knowledge there is and i think
01:06:18 there are other important ways of getting to know things and one of them is historical for
01:06:23 example and i mentioned earlier that i think i became persuaded and i were and i still am persuaded that the
01:06:29 historical evidence for the resurrection is very is very persuasive again it's not proof
01:06:35 or anything like that but it's but it's pretty good evidence okay yeah i've i talked to richard dawkins
01:06:42 on this podcast and and  i saw you debate with sean carroll so
01:06:49 i i i understand this world it makes it makes me very curious but maybe  let me ask sort of another way
01:06:57 my own kind of  world view maybe you can help as by way of therapy i understand
01:07:05 you know because you kind of said that there's other ways of knowing what about if we cut if if i kind of sit here
01:07:14 and am cognizant of the fact that i almost don't know anything so sort of i'm sit here almost paralyzed
01:07:21 by the the mystery of it all and it's not even when you say there's other ways of knowing
01:07:28 it it feels almost too confident to me because  yeah when i when i listen to beautiful music or see art there's something there that's
01:07:39 and that's  that's beyond the reach of scientism i would say so beyond the reach of  the the tools of science
01:07:48 but i don't even feel like that could be an as an actual tool of knowing it yeah i just don't even know where
01:07:55 to begin because it just feels like we know so little like  if we look even a hundred
01:08:00 years from now when people look back to this time humans look back to this time
01:08:05 they'll probably laugh at how little we knew even a hundred years from now and if we look at a thousand years from now
01:08:11 hopefully we're still alive or some version of our you know they they'll certainly laugh at
01:08:21 the absurdity of our beliefs so what do you  so you don't seem to be as paralyzed by
01:08:28 how little we know you confidently push on forward but what do you make of that sense of
01:08:35  of just not knowing of the mystery we need to be modest or or humble if even
01:08:44 about what we know i accept that and i i certainly think that's true not not simply because in the future we'll
01:08:51 know more science and there will be more powerful ways of finding out about things
01:08:57 but simply because you know sometimes we're not right we're wrong okay in what we think we know
01:09:06  so that's crucial but it's also a very christian outlook that kind of humility
01:09:16 is what jesus taught so i so i don't know whether this was in the back of your mind when you were thinking about
01:09:19 this but it's often the case that people of religious faith are are accused of being dogmatists
01:09:28 okay and there is a sense in which dogma teaching accepted teaching is is part of religions okay but i don't think that necessarily
01:09:39   that leads one to blind dogmatism and i don't i certainly don't think that faith
01:09:45 we can talk about this later if you'd like but i certainly don't think that faith means thinking you know
01:09:51 something and not listening to counter arguments for example um
01:09:58 so i i think that's crucial yeah what is  what does faith mean to you what does it feel like
01:10:05 what is it actually sort of how do you carry your faith in terms of the way you see the world
01:10:09 well i think faith is very often misunderstood in our society at the moment because
01:10:19  it's often portrayed as being nothing other than  believing things you know ain't true
01:10:30 you know or or believing things that are are not proven okay and and this and faith does have
01:10:39 a strand which is to do with you know basically believing in  in concepts or um
01:10:48 propositions but actually the word faith is much broader than that faith also means um
01:10:56 you know trusting in something trusting in a person or trusting in a thing  the reliability of some technology
01:11:03 for example that's equally part of the meaning of the word faith
01:11:09 and and there's a third strand to the to the meaning of the word as well and that is loyalty so
01:11:18 you know i have faith in my wife and and i try to act in faith towards her and that's a kind
01:11:23 of loyalty and so those three strands are the are the most important
01:11:28 strands of the meaning of faith yes belief in in propositions that we might not have
01:11:34 you know full proof about or maybe we have very little proof about but it's also trust and and loyalty
01:11:44 and actually in the in terms of the christian faith christians are far more called to trust
01:11:50 and loyalty than they are to belief in things they don't you know don't have proof of okay but
01:11:58 but the critics of religion generally tend to emphasize the first one and say well you know you believe things
01:12:03 for which you have no evidence okay that's what that's what they think faith is well
01:12:09 yeah there there is a sense in which everybody has to live their lives  believing or or or making decisions
01:12:21 in situations when they don't have all the proof or evidence or knowledge that enables you to make a completely
01:12:31 rational or well-informed or prudent decision we you know we do this all the time you
01:12:36 know my drive down here i nearly took a wrong turning and i thought which which way do i go do i
01:12:41 keep going straight on and so my  voice came out and i think go straight okay
01:12:52 so so you have to make decisions and sometimes you know you don't have a navigation system telling you what to do you just
01:12:58 have to make that decision with no with insufficient evidence and you're doing it all the time
01:13:03 as a human and that's part of being sentient and so that kind of um
01:13:11 action and belief on the basis of incomplete evidence is not something that i feel
01:13:15 uncomfortable doing or i feel that i feel on that somehow my christian commitments have forced me to
01:13:20 do when i wouldn't have had to have done it otherwise i would have had to do it anyway
01:13:26 and and so you know there's a sense in which i think it's important to see the
01:13:31 breadth of meaning of faith and and and to recognize then certainly in the case of christianity
01:13:38 it's trust and loyalty that the the key themes that we're called to and i mean another
01:13:45 interesting extension of that that you speak to it's kind of loyalty is referring to 
01:13:51 a connection with something outside of yourself yeah so i think you've spoken about like
01:13:57 existentialism or even just atheism in general as as leading naturally to an individualism
01:14:04 as a focus on the on the self and  ideas that maybe the christian faith can instill in you is um
01:14:13 allowing you to sort of look outside of yourself so connection i mean loyalty fundamentally is about
01:14:18 other beings and yeah other beings and i mean i think i don't know what it is in me but i'm
01:14:27 very much drawn to that idea and i think humans in general are drawn to that idea
01:14:32 you can you can make all kinds of evolutionary arguments all that kind of stuff but 
01:14:37 people always kind of tease me  because i talk about love a lot and i mean there's a lot of 
01:14:44 non-scientific things about love right like what what the heck is that thing why why do
01:14:48 we even need that thing it  it seems to be an annoying burden that  that we we get so much 
01:14:54 joy in in life from a connection with other human beings deep  lasting connections with human beings
01:15:00 same thing with loyalty why why do we get so much value and pleasure and strength and meaning from loyalty
01:15:08 from a connection with somebody else going through  thick and thin with somebody else going through some hard
01:15:12 times i mean some of the you know the closest friends i i have is going through some
01:15:19 some rough times together and that seems to make life deeply meaningful what is that
01:15:28 so yeah i that's that resonates with me and i obviously i would i would affirm it um
01:15:36 i i think just to just to correct the implication that you made i i don't think it's necessarily
01:15:44 the co the consequence of atheism  that we that we lose track of those kinds of
01:15:49 things i i mean i think that atheists can be loyal okay if you like
01:15:55 the question more often comes up in the context of you know where does morality come from
01:16:03 and loyalty i think and duty are related to one another you know if we have loyalty to someone then we have a duty
01:16:08 to them okay as well and i think that in so far as we see ourselves as having some kinds
01:16:17 any kinds of duties or moral compulsions with respect to our relationships to other people
01:16:23 it's i think it's a question that always arises well where does these where do these come from
01:16:28 and there there are various approaches that people have towards deciding what makes
01:16:37 ethics or morality moral okay but i do think it's the case that it's very hard to ground morality
01:16:50 in in any kind of absolute way or a persuasive way in mere human relationships
01:16:58 and so it's certainly the case that in christianity there is a sense in which morality and
01:17:09 you know the morality of morals comes from a transcendent place from a transcendent deity ground our the compelling
01:17:26 force of of morals on god more than we do on individuals because after all you know
01:17:33 if it if you if you've got nothing but you know other people why should you you know treat your neighbor well why
01:17:40 shouldn't you defraud your neighbor if it's good for you well you know you can construct all
01:17:46 kinds of arguments and some of them are you know obviously arguments that are commonplace in
01:17:51 religion too you should do as you would be done by and all this kind of thing right but none of that seems any any
01:17:58 more than mere pragmatism to most people okay and so that's what that's one of the things if
01:18:04 that nature amongst others you know really identified you know if god is dead if the idea of god is grounding our
01:18:10 moral behavior is no longer viable in the west which nietzsche thought that it wasn't
01:18:18 okay then what does ground it and he had no good answer for it in fact he claimed there was no answer
01:18:23 but then he couldn't live with that and so he invented the idea of the ubermensch you know this the superior human being okay
01:18:34 and this was  a different way of trying to ground morality not a very successful
01:18:39 one you know you could argue that is the forerunner of the sort of  racism of hitler's regime and and
01:18:49 and so forth that you know we've in the west thankfully shied away from  in
01:18:55 in the past   half or three quarters of a century but you know i think it is the case
01:19:04 that  christianity gives me a basis for my moral beliefs that is more than mere
01:19:14 pragmatism yeah but there is  so stepping outside of all of that there does seem to be
01:19:21 a powerful stabilizing like we humans are able to hold ideas together like in a distributed way 
01:19:26 outside of whether god exists or not or any that just our ability to kind of converse together
01:19:34 towards a set of beliefs  into sometimes into tribes it's kind of um
01:19:40 i don't know if it's inherent to being human beings and i hope not because now if i look on
01:19:45 twitter  and there's  there's the red team and the blue team right it's almost like  it's it's a charac
01:19:53 it's some kind of tv show that we're living in  that people get into these tribes and
01:19:57 they hold a set of beliefs that sometimes don't i mean they they are beliefs for the sake of holding
01:20:04 those beliefs and we get this intimate connection between each other for sharing those beliefs
01:20:12 and we spoke to the things about loyalty and love and that's the thing that people feel inside the
01:20:16 tribe and it seems very human that within that tribe those beliefs don't necessarily
01:20:24 always have to be connected to anything it's just the fact that  you know i've  did sports
01:20:29   my whole life whenever you're on a team the bond you get with other people on the team is incredible
01:20:37 and the actual sport is is often the silliest i mean i don't play ball sports anymore but the ball when i played like soccer
01:20:43 or tennis i mean all those sports are silly right you're playing with a little ball
01:20:49 but there's the bond you get is so deeply meaningful so i just it's interesting to me on on the
01:20:56 sociological level that it's it's possible to me whatever the beliefs of religion
01:21:03 is whatever they're actually grounded in they might be  they might have a power in themselves i think there is tribalism
01:21:12 everywhere and i think tribalism in the u.s at the moment is rather difficult to bear
01:21:19 from my point of view and it's i think fed by the internet and social media and so forth but
01:21:26 but it's but historically tribalism is has been a trait and remains a trait in humans the genius of christianity is
01:21:37 that it supersedes tribalism i mean yes when the hebrews thought about yahweh initially
01:21:47 they thought about him as their tribal deity just like the tribal deities round about about them and so but and and yet
01:21:58 from you know early on in hebrew history the crucial thing that yahweh came to mean or i would say revealed
01:22:10 of himself to them was that he wasn't just a tribal deity he was the god that created the whole thing and if
01:22:17 he is the god of the whole thing then he's not just the god of the hebrews or in the case of
01:22:25 you know americans god is not just the god of americans he's the god of everybody okay and that is a way
01:22:34 in a way the most amazing transcending of tribal loyalties and  one of the crucial
01:22:44 you know occasions in the new testament you know when the holy spirit comes at pentecost you know the the the apostles and the
01:22:54 and the disciples speak in other tongues and there are people from all all the countries you know round about
01:22:58 hear them in their own languages and so you know whether whether you take that as factual or not
01:23:08 that is the a statement of the transcendent aspects of christianity or the claimed transcendent aspects of christianity
01:23:17 that it transcends culture and that's certainly something which i touch on this topic in my own mind 
01:23:27 one of the hardest questions is as is why is there suffering in the world do you have a good answer well i have i
01:23:36 have some answers but you're right that it is one of the toughest questions
01:23:41 the problem of pain or the problem of suffering or the problem of  theodicy as
01:23:48 as theologians call it is is is probably one of the toughest i think it's important to
01:23:55 say that there are certain types of answers to this question but there are aspects of this question
01:24:00 to which there is no intellectual answer that is going to satisfy and and the the fact of the matter is
01:24:09 you know when i'm speaking to an audience  let's say at some kind of lecture i can be sure that there are peop there
01:24:18 are people in that audience who are either personally suffering they've got
01:24:24 illness they've got pains they're maybe they're facing death or someone in their family is in similar
01:24:29 sorts of situations so suffering is a reality and and and there is nothing that i
01:24:36 can say that is going to solve their feeling of agony and angst and and
01:24:43 maybe despair in those types of situations there is really only one thing that i think humans can do
01:24:51 for one another in those kinds of situations and that is simply to be there to be there alongside your friend or your
01:25:01 or your colleague or or whoever you know family member or whoever it might be and that's the only really sense in
01:25:08 which we can give comfort if we try to give intellectual solutions to these problems were going
01:25:15 to be like like the comforters that were in the book of job in the
01:25:22 in the bible who who brought no comfort to job himself with their intellectual answers but if they had
01:25:30 been there and some of them were there they sat alongside that is some level of comfort and
01:25:37 and after all that's the meaning of the word compassion it means to suffer alongside of somebody
01:25:45 and i would say first off you know what does a christian say about suffering the the first thing a
01:25:50 christian should say is compassion is all that really counts and what's more
01:25:58 we say that god has acted in compassion towards us that is to say he has suffered with us
01:26:06 in the person of jesus christ and when we see the passion of jesus we recognize that god takes
01:26:15 suffering deadly seriously has taken it so seriously that he's been willing to come and be a
01:26:20 part of his creation in the person of of jesus christ and suffer death the most horrible death on the cross
01:26:30 and for our benefit so that's one side of of suffering but the question no the
01:26:37 philosophical question remains you know surely if god is good you know and god is omnipotent benevolent um
01:26:47 you know why doesn't he  take away all the suffering why doesn't he cause miracles to occur that will take
01:26:52 away all this suffering i think there are some good answers to that question um
01:27:00 in the in the following sense that you know we live in a world where the consistency of the world is an
01:27:11 absolutely crucial part of it you know the fact that our world behaves reproducibly in the main
01:27:18 is absolutely essential for the integrity of our lives without it we wouldn't exist okay and so there is a sense in which
01:27:28 the integrity of creation calls for there being consistent behavior which
01:27:34 you know these days we think of as being the laws of nature okay and so the consistent behavior of nature
01:27:42 is very very important it's what enables us to be what we are and if you're calling upon god in
01:27:51 in in in your critique of why isn't this benevolent creator you know fixing things one answer is
01:28:00 he's fixed things in a certain sense to have an integrity in them and that integrity is the best thing
01:28:10 it's the way we have our existence the way we live and move and have our being and you know if you want something
01:28:17 different you've got to show that there is a way in which you could invent a world that is better
01:28:24 that it has the integrity that we need to exist okay and and and to be able to think and and and
01:28:31 love and and be but but you were gonna do it better you know and the atheists think that maybe they
01:28:38 have got a better idea but if they thought about it a bit more carefully they'd realize
01:28:43 no one has put forward a better idea okay so the so another way to say that  i mean is that
01:28:52 suffering is an integral part of this of of a consistent existence so so sort of 
01:29:03 in the philosophical in a philosophical sense  the full richness and the beauty of our experience
01:29:10 would not be as beautiful would not be as rich if there was no suffering in the world
01:29:15 is that is that possible well i think you said two different things that aren't exactly at least that
01:29:20 aren't exactly the same one is that suffering is an integral part of
01:29:26 our experience you know that might be considered a challenge to certain types of
01:29:33 christian theology or or even jewish theology in other words christians talk about the fall and talk about
01:29:40  adam and eve in the garden and and have that have a vision of there being some kind of pers
01:29:46 perception from or or perfection from which we have fallen and i think there is a perfection
01:29:51 from which we've fallen but i don't think that perfection is some kind of physical com
01:29:57 perfection in other words i don't subscribe personally to the view that some some christians do that there
01:30:04 was some state prior to the fall in which death did not occur i don't think that that's consistent
01:30:12 with science as we know it and i and i think that death for example has been part of the biological
01:30:22 world and and the universe as a whole from from billions of years ago so so just to be clear about that you know
01:30:32 i i on the other hand i do so if that's the case then certainly in that sense at the very least
01:30:40 suffering or at least death okay is part of the biological existence and that probably seems so
01:30:48 completely obvious to somebody who you know is okay with science whether they you know whether they're a
01:30:54 scientist or not well so and i apologize if i'm interrupting but it's the obvious reality of
01:31:01 of  our life today but there's a lot of people i think it's currently in vogue i've talked to quite a few folks who
01:31:08 kind of see as the goal of many of our pursuits as to extend life indefinitely a sort of 
01:31:15 you know a dream for many people is to live forever  but in the in this in the
01:31:19 technological world in the engineering world in the scientific world i mean that's that's
01:31:23 the big dream to me it feels like that's not a dream it's i certainly
01:31:31 would like to live forever  like that that's the initial feeling the instinctual feeling
01:31:38 because you know life is so amazing but then if you actually kind of like you've presented it if you actually
01:31:44  lived that kind of life you would realize that that's actually a step backwards that's a step down from the
01:31:50 experience of this life in my sense that death is an essential part of life
01:31:56 about the essential part of this experience death of all things so the thing the fact that things end somehow
01:32:05 and the scarcity of things somehow create the beauty of this experience that we have yeah transhumanism doesn't look very
01:32:14 attractive to me either but it also doesn't look very feasible but that's a whole big topic that i'm
01:32:23 not exactly an expert but i'll say but i but you know i've i'm of a certain age where
01:32:30 my mortality is more pressing or more obvious to me than it once was okay and and i don't
01:32:40 dread that i don't see that as in a certain sense even the enemy okay you're not afraid of
01:32:46 death well i'm afraid of lots of things in a in a in a conceptual way but it doesn't keep me
01:32:55 awake at night okay i i'm i think like most people i'm more afraid of pain than i am of death
01:33:02 so i i don't want to put myself forward to some kind of hero that doesn't worry about these things that's not true
01:33:09 but i i do think and then and maybe this is part of my christian outlook that there is life beyond the grave
01:33:20 but i don't think that that it's life in this universe or in this certainly not in this body and maybe not
01:33:28 in a certain sense in this mind i mean you know christian christian belief in the afterlife is is
01:33:34 that we will be resurrected we will in a certain sense be with god i don't know what that means and i don't think
01:33:37 anybody else really quite knows what that means but there are lots of ways that
01:33:44 over history people artists and and and writers and so forth have pictured it and these are all perhaps some of
01:33:50 them helpful ways of thinking about it do you think it's possible to know what happens after we die
01:33:57 i i don't think we find out by near-death experiences or those kinds of things but
01:34:04 but i but i think that you know that we have sufficient i feel i have sufficient information if you like in terms of
01:34:12 god's revelation to be confident that that i will go somewhere else okay but it won't be here
01:34:23 and i to me the aspirations of transhumanism are horrific i mean i think it would be a
01:34:32 nightmare not a dream a nightmare you know to be somehow downloaded into
01:34:40 a computer and live one's life like that because it it completely discounts the in integrity of our bodies as well as our
01:34:47 minds i mean we aren't just disembodied minds it would not be me that was in the computer
01:34:57 it would be something else if if that kind of download were possible of course it isn't possible and it's
01:35:03 very long way from being possible but you know amazing things happen so we shouldn't be too cert so this is this is a place
01:35:10 that  again maybe taking a slight step outside  we're philosophizing a little bit  let me
01:35:17 ask you about  human level or superhuman level intelligence  the  artificial intelligence systems
01:35:28 do you what do you make from from almost a religious or a perspective that we've been
01:35:34 talking about of the special aspect of human nature of us creating intelligence systems that
01:35:41 exhibit some elements of that human nature is that something again like we were talking about with transhumanism
01:35:49  there's a feasibility question of how hard is it to actually build machines or human level intelligence
01:35:54 or have something like consciousness or have all those kinds of human qualities and then there's the do we want to
01:36:02 do that kind of thing so on both of those directions what do you think well okay so you know since your podcast
01:36:09 is called ai i don't want to offend too many of your listeners out there that's but i
01:36:15 but i i think one should be a little bit more modest about one's claims for ai than have typically been the case
01:36:21 yeah i think that actually a lot of people in ai are somewhat chastened and so there
01:36:26 there are more modest claims than are common with the transhumanists and yes and and so forth
01:36:34 and you know i used to play chess when i was a kid i was pretty good at it okay
01:36:40 he won competitions and so so on and so forth and i when i'm talking about when i was
01:36:46 in high school i thought it was pretty unlikely that a computer would be able to become
01:36:52 good at chess but i was dead wrong okay and so you know how did that make you feel by the way
01:36:57 when do you blew big kids i stopped playing chess seriously when i had when i encountered computers
01:37:03 that could beat me okay i still play with my grandchildren a little bit but
01:37:11 but but yeah it it seemed like in a certain sense it became a solved problem  when a.i was able to do it
01:37:17 better than i could so i think that there are ways in which today we've seen
01:37:23 computers do things which historically were regarded as being very characteristic of human intelligence
01:37:32 and in that sense there there is some success to ai i also think that you know there are
01:37:38 certain things which one might think of as being ai which are you know completely widespread
01:37:44 in our society i'm thinking about the internet search engines  and so forth which are enormously influential and
01:37:54 obviously do things more powerfully than any individual human or even any combination of humans could do much
01:38:00 faster and and and  accessing databases and so on and so forth all of
01:38:07 this is  outstripped our human intelligence i'm not sure the extent though to
01:38:15 which that is really intelligence  in the way that was traditionally meant but it's certainly amazingly
01:38:25 facile and it it multiplies our ability to access human knowledge and and data and so
01:38:32 forth so is that something is that enter the realm of something we should be
01:38:37 concerned about so in the realm of religion you talk about what is good what is evil what is
01:38:42 right what is wrong you have a set of morals set of beliefs and when you have an entity come into
01:38:48 the picture that that has quite a bit of power if we potentially look into the future
01:38:57 and intelligence and capability do you think there's something that religion can say
01:39:05 about artificial intelligence or is that something you we shouldn't worry about until it arrives you think
01:39:10 just like with the chess program you know religious writers have thought about this for centuries
01:39:17  you know there's been a long debate about what is what it was historically called the plurality of worlds
01:39:25 and it was actually more about whether there are places where other intelligent creatures
01:39:32 live than it was about us creating them but but i think it's largely the same question it's almost like aliens
01:39:39 yeah other intelligence so if there is other intelligent life in the universe what is its relationship to god okay
01:39:44 that is in a certain sense the puzzle that religious thinkers and writers have
01:39:49 thought about for a long time and there's a whole range of of different opinions about that
01:39:55 i mean personally you know i think it's it's an interesting question but it's not a very pressing question at the moment
01:40:02 yeah and i think the same way about the the question of what happens if we're able to build a sentient robot for example
01:40:09 i think it's an interesting question and we'll have to think about it when that happens but i think we're still quite a ways
01:40:15 away from that and so i i don't have a good answer but i think there's a literature that you one
01:40:21 could tap to think about okay if you want to start early on the question yeah
01:40:28 well let me ask you another impossible question you know from a religious or from a personal perspective
01:40:33 what do you think is consciousness this this  subjective experience that we seem to be having
01:40:42 does  this does  the christian religion have something to say about consciousness does your own
01:40:48 when you look in the mirror do you have a sense of what is consciousness i think the bible doesn't have much
01:40:55 in the way of answers about that directly in the sense that you're perhaps asking it which is more like
01:41:00 i think you're asking for some kind of  quasi scientific or maybe indeed scientific   description that's not really
01:41:07 looking for one yes i i think that i think that there it's an interesting question i think
01:41:15 it's actually a it's a jump too far i think we have we don't even know the answer to the
01:41:20 question what is the mind let alone consciousness so if you distinguish between those two things
01:41:25 i think the question that's being addressed more directly scientifically as well as in other ways
01:41:34 it is what is the mind and that is certainly a very topical question even in places like mit
01:41:39 which is not historically involved with philosophical questions you know that people
01:41:46 doing neuroscience and so forth i think it's a very important question and i think that we're going to find
01:41:54 that we are not computers in other words i think the the commonplace theory of
01:42:05 what mind is is is generally speaking by analogy that we are basically wet wet wear okay that we that we're some
01:42:16 computer-like entity and that that the analogy to digital computers is is is a pretty decent one i mean that
01:42:25 that's of course a viewpoint which you know which drives the aspirations of the transhumanists i
01:42:32 mean they they so much believe that our minds are nothing other than you know a certain sense some
01:42:38 kind of implementation of software in biology that they say to themselves well of course we're going to be able to download
01:42:45 it into a into a digital computer i don't think that's true i think it's most likely that
01:42:54 quantum mechanics is very important in the brain  it seems most unlikely that it's not
01:43:01 to me i know that that's contrary to the opinions of many people but but that's my view and it's also a view
01:43:08 for example of people like roger penrose and people like that who've written about it rather extensively
01:43:16 and if that's the case then really my mind is not reproduce reducible to some kind of software which
01:43:25 can be considered to be portable it is so connected to the hardware of my body that the two are inseparable
01:43:35 okay and so if that is in fact what we find as i suspect will be the case then the aspirations of the transhumanists
01:43:41 will be very long in coming if at all so i think that actually physics and chemistry
01:43:52 you know are in a certain are in a sense  involved with the brain and within the mind but not
01:43:59 in a very simple way like you know like the computer analogy in in a much more complicated way
01:44:09 and i also think that it's philosophically ignorant to speak as if
01:44:21 when and if the actions of the brain are are understood at the physical and chemical level
01:44:29 that will me that the mind will vanish as a concept you know that we'll just say we're nothing but
01:44:35 brains okay of course it won't i mean it may well be that our mind is an emergent
01:44:41 phenomenon that comes out of the physics and chemistry and biology okay but it's also something that we
01:44:47 have to encounter and take seriously and so you know it's it's not the case that
01:44:54 it that the mind is reducible to nothing but physics and chemistry even if it's
01:45:02 embedded in you know continuously into physics and chemistry as i rather suspect it is
01:45:11 so i that that's my own view i mean another way of putting it is that the mind or the soul
01:45:18 is not something added into humans as might have been the viewpoint historically i do think there is you
01:45:26 know there is something added to humans but it's not it's not the mind it's the spirit and
01:45:30 that takes us beyond the physical context beyond this universe but i but i don't think that that
01:45:36 consciousness the mind et cetera et cetera is that thing which is necessarily added in explicit so i mean
01:45:44 i'm not a substance duelist in that sense okay if you want to put it philosophically i mean but you see you your senses um
01:45:53 so the mind and the intelligence and consciousness can be these emergent things do you have do you have a hope a sense
01:46:00 that science could help us get pretty far down the road of understanding we will get much further
01:46:10 than we have and we it'll be interesting i mean right now our our methods of diagnosing the human brain
01:46:18 are extremely primitive i mean the resolution that we have you know that comes out of  out of nmr
01:46:26 and and brain scans and so forth is miserable compared with what we need in order to understand the brain at the
01:46:32 cellular level let alone at the at the atomic level but  you know we're making progress it's
01:46:39 relatively slow progress but it's progress and people are working on it and we're going to get better at it and we'll find
01:46:45 out very interesting things as we do the time resolution is also completely hopeless compared
01:46:50 compare with what we need to understand the thought you know so so there's a long way to go and we
01:46:57 will get better at it but i'm but i'm not at all worried as some people
01:47:02 are and some people speak as if there's a good thing that somehow the concepts of
01:47:10 humanity and the mind and religion and and consciousness are going to vanish because we're going to have you know
01:47:17 complete  physical chemical description of the brain in the near future
01:47:23 that we're not going to have that and secondly even if we had it the mind and all these other things
01:47:28 aren't going to vanish because of it well i i find kind of compelling that the notion that whoever created this
01:47:36 universe and us  did so to understand itself himself i mean that there's this um
01:47:48 there's a powerful self reflection notion to this whole experiment that we're a part of
01:47:54 i certainly think that god takes delight in his creation and that it was created for that delight
01:48:00 as much as it was for any other reason and that you know that therefore are there's
01:48:07 reason to be hopeful and and awestruck by the creation whether it's
01:48:14 on the very small or on the very large i'm not sure if you're familiar there's something called the simulation hypothesis
01:48:21 that's been fun to talk about with the computer scientists and so on which is a kind of thought experiment that proposes
01:48:30 that you know the entirety of the world around us is a kind of a computer program that's a simulation and then we're
01:48:36 living inside it i think there's i think from a certain perspective that could be consistent
01:48:44 with a religious view of the world i mean you could just use different terms  basically
01:48:51  what are your but it's a it's a it feels like a more modern updated version of that
01:49:00 but what is what's your sense of this  or the simulation hypothesis do you find it interesting useful to think about it
01:49:05 do you find it ridiculous did you find it fun what what are your thoughts 
01:49:11 it's fun and it's been of course the subject of various movies yeah that that some of which are very well
01:49:17 known you know i don't think it makes sense to think of it as a simulation hypothesis
01:49:27 in the sense that we're really lying in  banks of of 
01:49:37 on banks of beds having our energy drained away from us and and the simulation is going on in
01:49:42 our individual brains that that makes no sense to me at all i don't think that's what's
01:49:48 meant by the simulation hypothesis as as you're using it now but i think that there is a um
01:49:56 there is very little distinction between saying that a an intelligent creator has set up the universe according to
01:50:07 his will and his plan and set it in motion and is allowing it to run out maybe as
01:50:15 christians say he's sustaining it actually by his word of power it says in the book
01:50:24 of the letter to hebrews okay in in in this amazingly consistent and integrated way
01:50:34 i don't think there's very much difference between saying that and saying that it's assimilation okay
01:50:39 i mean i think it's almost the same thing okay but i but i think from but i think it's
01:50:49 the simulation in that concept the simulation and the creation or the or the universe are the same thing
01:50:56 okay in other words it's a simulation you know that is billions of light years across okay yeah i mean there's a sense in
01:51:05 which it helps one understand especially if you're not religious that there is something outside of the
01:51:13 world that we live in that there's something bigger than the world we live in um
01:51:17 and that i mean it's just another perspective on  that humbles humbles you so
01:51:24 in that sense it's a powerful thought experiment one shortcoming of that is is the following is of the of the
01:51:31 analogy here's this that we think of a simulation as something take taking place
01:51:37 in the universe you know when we it's it's taking place in my computer okay i don't think that's the right analogy for
01:51:48 a christian view of creation okay i don't think it's taking place in some other universe that god has made okay i think
01:51:57 maybe it's taking place in the mind of god christians might hypothesize also but i but i think that that
01:52:05 that it's important to recognize that christian theology at a at any rate is that god is not one of
01:52:12 the entities in the universe and and presumably therefore is very different from a simulation that we
01:52:19 might run on a computer let me ask you adam and eve even adam ate of the fruit
01:52:25 of the tree of knowledge of good and evil does this is this story meaningful to you what does the story mean to you
01:52:33 yeah it is meaningful to me i i take the you know the writings of the bible very seriously and i think that
01:52:39 most christians regard them as having some kind of authoritative role in their in their in their faith
01:52:48 what do i get from it i mean i think the most important thing that christians get from the story of adam and eve and
01:52:54 eating the apple and so forth is that the relationship between humans and god is broken
01:53:03 has been broken by man's disobedience that's what the the story of adam and eve and the apple is all about
01:53:11 and that that broken relationship is for christians what jesus came to redeem came to
01:53:21 overcome that brokenness and to some extent at any rate on earth and and ultimately
01:53:35 you know in in the in eternity to restore it fully so that's really what christians mean
01:53:43 and gain from the story of adam and eve of course lots of people ask the questions about how so how
01:53:48 literally should we take these stories of particularly the first few few chapters of genesis which is an
01:53:54 important question but but i mean but we tend to get bogged down with it a bit too much
01:54:02 i think we should take away the message and i think the the the  what the what actually we would have
01:54:10 seen if we'd been there okay is something which is a matter of speculation and it's certainly not
01:54:16 terribly important from the point of view of christian theology but it seems like a very important moment
01:54:25 as a man of faith do you do you do you wish that  i think it was eve first
01:54:31  yeah we'll see do you wish by the way it was just a fruit it was a few you said it very carefully it was the
01:54:41 do you wish they wouldn't have eaten of the tree i mean this is back to our discussion of suffering was
01:54:46 that like an essential thing that needed to happen you're gonna have to read paradise last
01:54:59 beautifully put okay well let me ask the the biggest question one that you also touch in your book but one that i ask
01:55:06 every once in a while is what is the the meaning of my life is many different things okay but it but they are all kind of
01:55:24 i mean for a christian one's relationship with god is a crucial part of the meaning of life
01:55:33 but one's relationship with one's family wife's wife parents children grandchildren in my case
01:55:41 and so forth those are crucially important these are all the places where people whether they're religious or not
01:55:55 but ultimately i think a person who has faith in a creator who we think has
01:56:06 a an intention or many intentions but  but but but a will in respect of the world as a whole that's
01:56:16 a crucial part of meaning and the idea that my life might have some small significance in the plan
01:56:27 of that creator is an amazingly powerful idea that give that brings meaning um
01:56:37 i i tell a story in my book that when i was a student before i became a christian i read a
01:56:41 philosophy book whose approximate title was what you know what is the meaning of life
01:56:48 and you know that book basically said there is no meaning to life you have to make up the meaning as you go along
01:56:54 and i think that's probably the the predominant secular view is these days that there is no real
01:57:00 meaning but you can make up a meaning and that will give you meaning into your life um
01:57:07 i don't subscribe to that view anymore i think there is more meaning than that but i do think that those things
01:57:13 which give meaning to our life are very important and we should emphasize them and you you have said that as the part
01:57:19 of the as the part of that meaning is the part of your faith 
01:57:26 love and loyalty are key parts so can you try to say what is  love and loyalty
01:57:38 like what if you were to give advice to  to your children grandchildren of what to look for
01:57:56 in and looking for loyalty and and love what would you try to say well i think it's something like
01:58:04 yielding your will or desire to another it's valuing others more highly
01:58:16 or at least as highly as yourself but that's just the start of it because true love re you reach a point where you are
01:58:26 you feel compelled by the other  and that i think to some people sounds very scary but actually
01:58:36 it's terrifically liberating and i think that love then brings you into service towards
01:58:48 another and i'm you know reminded of the phrase from the anglican  prayer book where it talks about um
01:58:57 jesus whose service is perfect freedom in other words for us christians to serve god
01:59:04 is what perfects our freedom and i think there is an amazing love as um
01:59:11 is in part capped captivity but in a kind of paradoxical sense it's also an amazing freedom love is freedom
01:59:21 i don't think there's a better way to end it we started with fusion energy and ending on love and there's a huge

02:00:26 finally i would like to assure my many buddhists christian hindu jewish and muslim friends that i
02:00:31 am sincerely happy that the religion which chance has given you has contributed to your peace of mind
02:00:39 and often as western medical science now reluctantly admits to your physical well-being perhaps it is better to be unsane and happy
02:00:50 than sane and unhappy but it is the best of all to be sane and happy whether our
02:00:55 descendants can achieve that goal will be the greatest challenge of the future indeed it may well decide
