00:00:01 the following is a conversation with s James Gates Jr he's a theoretical physicist and professor Brown University
00:00:09 working on supersymmetry super gravity a super string theory he served on former President Obama's Council of Advisors on
00:00:17 science technology and he's now the co-author of a new book titled proving Einstein right about the scientists who
00:00:24 set out to prove in Stein's theory of relativity you may have noticed that I've been speaking with not just
00:00:30 computer scientists but philosophers mathematicians physicists economists and soon much more to me AI is much bigger
00:00:38 than deep learning bigger than computing it is our civilizations journey into understanding the human mind and
00:00:45 creating echoes in the machine that journey includes of course the world of theoretical physics and its practice of
00:00:52 first principles mathematical thinking in exploring the fundamental nature of our reality this is the artificial

00:03:10 and now here's my conversation with s James Gates Jr you tell a story when you were 8 he had a profound realization at
00:03:19 the stars in the sky are actually places that we could travel to one day do you think human beings will ever venture
00:03:27 outside our solar system Wow the question of whether humanity gets outside of the solar system it's going
00:03:33 to be a challenge and as long as the laws of physics that we have today are accurate and valid it's gonna be
00:03:40 extraordinarily difficult I'm a science-fiction fan as you probably know so I love to dream of starships and
00:03:49 traveling to other solar systems but the barriers are just formidable if we just kind of venture a little bit into
00:03:55 science fiction do you think the spaceships if we are successful that take us outside the solar system
00:04:02 we'll look like the ones we have today or do fundamental breakthrough our fundamental breakthroughs necessary in
00:04:10 order to have genuine starships probably some really radical views about the way the universe works is our going to have
00:04:17 to take place in our science we could with our current technology think about constructing
00:04:26 multi-generational starships where the people who get on them are not that people who get off at the other end but
00:04:34 even if we do that there for mental problems actually our bodies which doesn't seem to be conscious for a lot
00:04:43 of people even getting to Mars is going to present this challenge because we live in this a wonderful home has a
00:04:50 protective magnetic magnetosphere around it and so we're shielded from cosmic radiation once you leave this shield
00:04:58 there are some estimates that for example if you send someone to Mars with that technology probably about two years
00:05:05 out there without the seal they're gonna be mom bartered that means radiation that probably means cancer so that's one
00:05:13 of the most formal challenge even if we could get over the technology if you think so Mars is a harsh place you have
00:05:23 musk SpaceX and other folks NASA are really pushing to put a human being on Mars do you think again
00:05:29 let's forgive me for lingering in science fiction land for a little bit do you think one day we may be able to
00:05:36 colonize Mars first do you think we'll put a human on Mars and then do you think we'll put many humans on Mars so
00:05:43 first of all we're not I am extraordinarily convinced we will not put a human on Mars by 2030 which is a
00:05:50 date that you often hear in the public debate what's the challenge there well you think so
00:05:55 there are a couple of ways that I could slice this but the one that I think is simplest for people and understand
00:06:03 involves money so you look at how we got to the moon in the 1960s it was about 10-year duration between the challenge
00:06:10 that President Kennedy laid out and our successfully landing a moon I was actually here at MIT when that first
00:06:16 moon landing occurred so I remember watching it on TV but how do we get there well we had this extraordinary
00:06:25 technical agency of the United States government NASA it consumed about 5% of the countries
00:06:34 economic output and so you say 5% of the economic output over about a 10-year period gets us 250,000 miles in space
00:06:43 Mars is about a hundred times farther so you have at least a hundred times a challenge and we're spending about one
00:06:49 tenth of the funds that we spent then as a government so my claim is is that it's at least a thousand times harder for me
00:06:57 to imagine us getting to Mars by 2030 and yet that part that you mentioned in the speech that I just have to throw in
00:07:05 there of JFK of we do these things not because they're easy but because they're hard it's such a beautiful line that I
00:07:10 would love to hear a modern president say about a scientific endeavor well one day we live in hope that such a
00:07:19 precedent will arise for our nation but even if like I said even if you you fix the profit technical problems the
00:07:28 biological engineering that I worry most about however I'm gonna go out on a limb here I think that by two thousand ninety
00:07:39 or so or two thousand one hundred and so let's say 120 I suspect we're gonna have a human on Mars
00:07:45 Wow so you think that many years out first a few tangents he said bioengineering as a as a challenge of
00:07:52 what's what's the challenge there so as I said the the real problem with interstellar travel aside from the
00:08:01 technology challenges the real problem is radiation and how do you engineer either an environment or a body because
00:08:11 we see rapid advances going on in bioengineering how do you engineer either a ship or body so that something
00:08:20 is some person that's recognizably Union human will survive the rigors of interplanetary space travel it's much
00:08:26 more difficult than most people seem to take into account so if we could linger on the 2092 2121
00:08:40 20 sort of thinking of that kind of you know and we let's linger on money okay so Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are
00:08:49 pushing the cost trying to quit push the cost down I mean this is so do you have hope is this actually a sort of a
00:08:56 brilliant big-picture scientist do you think a business entrepreneur can take science and make it cheaper and get it
00:09:05 out there faster so bending the cost curve is you'll notice that has been an anchor there's the simplest way for me
00:09:10 to discuss this with people about what the challenge is so yes bending the cost curve is certainly critical if we're
00:09:19 going to be successful now you asked about the endeavors that are out there now sponsored by two very prominent
00:09:26 American citizens Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk I'm disappointed actually in what I see in terms of the routes that are being
00:09:36 pursued so let me give you one example there and this one is going to be a little bit more technical so if you look
00:09:42 at the kinds of rockets that both these organizations are creating yes it's wonderful reusable technology to see a
00:09:50 rocket go up and land on its fins just like it did in science fiction movies when I was a kid that's astounding but
00:09:59 the real problem is those Rockets the technology that we're doing now is not really that different than what was used
00:10:04 to go to the moon and there are alternatives it turns out there's an engine called a flare engine which so a
00:10:11 traditional rocket if you look at the engine looks like a bell right and then the flame comes out the bottom but there
00:10:16 is a kind of engine called a flare engine which is essentially when you look at it it looks like an exhaust pipe
00:10:26 on like a fancy car that's you know long and elongate it and it's a type of rocket engine that we know we know it's
00:10:33 there been preliminary testing we know it works and it also is actually much more economical because what it does is
00:10:40 allow you to vary the amount of thrust as you go up in a way that you cannot do with one of the
00:10:45 bell shaped engines so you would think that an entrepreneur might try to have the breakthrough to use flared nozzles
00:10:56 as they're called as a way to bend the cost curve because we keep coming back that's going to be a big factor but
00:11:01 that's not happening in fact what we see is what I think of as incremental change in terms of our technology so I'm not
00:11:08 really very encouraged by what I personally see so incremental change won't bend the cost curve and I don't
00:11:13 see it just linger on the sci-fi for one more question sure do you think we're alone
00:11:21 in the universe are we the only intelligent form of life so there is a quote by Carl Sagan which I really love
00:11:31 when I hear this question and I'm I recall the quote and it goes something like if we're the only conscious life in
00:11:39 the universe it's a terrible waste of space because the universe is an incredibly big place and when Carl made
00:11:49 that statement we didn't know about the profusion of planets that are out there in the last decade we've discovered over
00:11:57 a thousand planets and a substantial number of those planets are earth-like in terms of being in the Goldilocks zone
00:12:07 as it's called so it's on in my mind is practically inconceivable that were the only conscious form of life in the
00:12:14 universe but that doesn't mean they've come to visit us do you think they would look do you think will recognize alien
00:12:21 life if we saw it do you think you'd look anything like the carbon-based the biological system we have on earth today
00:12:30 it would depend on that life's native environment in which it arose if that environment was sufficiently like our
00:12:37 environment there's a principle in biology and nature called convergence which is that even if you have two
00:12:43 biological systems that are totally separated from each other if they face similar conditions they tend to kin
00:12:48 nature tends to converge on solutions and so there might be similarities if this alien life-form almost born in a
00:12:56 place that's kind of like this place physics appears to be quite similar the laws of physics across
00:13:04 the entirety of the universe do you think weirder things than we see on earth can spring up out of the same
00:13:10 kinds of laws of physics from the laws of physics I would say yes first of all if you look at carbon-based life why we
00:13:16 carbon base well it turns out it's because of the way that carbon interacts with elements which in fact is also a
00:13:24 reflection on the electronic Select structure of the carbon nucleus so you can look down the table developments and
00:13:30 say but gee do we see similar elements the answer is yes and one that when it often hears about in science fiction is
00:13:37 silicon so maybe there's a silicon-based life-form out there if the conditions are right but I think it's presumptuous
00:13:44 of us to think that we are the template by which all life has to appear before we dive into beautiful details let me
00:13:56 ask a big question what to you is the most beautiful idea maybe the most surprising and mysterious idea in
00:14:03 physics the most surprising idea to me is that we can actually do physics the universe did not have to be constructed
00:14:11 in such a way that our with our limited intellectual capacity that is actually put together in such a way and that we
00:14:20 are put together in such a way that we can with our minds I delve incredibly deeply into the structure of the
00:14:29 universe that to me is pretty close to a miracle so they're simple equations relatively simple that can describe
00:14:38 things you know the fundamental functions then describe everything about our reality
00:14:46 that's not can you imagine universes where everything is a lot more complicated do you think there's
00:14:54 something inherent about universes that well simple laws well first of all let me this is a question that I encounter
00:15:03 in a number of guys is a lot of people will raise the question about whether mathematics is the language of the
00:15:09 universe and my response is mathematics is the language that we humans are capable of using in
00:15:15 describing the universe it may have little to do with the universe but in terms of our capacity it's the
00:15:21 microscope it's the telescope through which we it's the lens through which we are able to view the universe with the
00:15:28 precision that no other human language allows so could there be other universes well I don't even know if this one looks
00:15:37 like I think it does but the beautiful surprising thing is that physics there are laws of physics very few laws of
00:15:48 physics they can effectively compress down the functioning of the universe yes that's extraordinarily surprising you
00:15:54 know I like to use the analogy with computers and information technology if you worry about transmitting large
00:16:01 bundles of data one of the things that computer scientists do for us is they allow for processes that are called
00:16:07 compression where you take big packets of data and you press them down into much smaller packets and then you
00:16:12 transmit those and then unpack them at the other end and so it looks a little bit to me like the universe is kind of
00:16:19 done us a favor it's constructed our minds in such a way that we have this thing called mathematics which then as
00:16:25 we look at the universe teaches us how to carry out the compression process a quick question about compression do you
00:16:34 think the human mind can be compressed the the biology could be compressed we talked about space travel to be able to
00:16:43 compress the information that captures some large percent of what it means to be me or you and then be able to send
00:16:53 that at the speed of light wow that's a big question and let me try to take it apart unpack it into several pieces I
00:17:01 don't believe that wetware biology such as we are has an exclusive patent on in own intellectual consciousness I suspect
00:17:11 that other structures in the universe are perfectly capable of producing the data streams that we use the process
00:17:18 first of all our observations of the universe and and an awareness of ourselves I can imagine
00:17:24 structures can do that also so that's part of what you were talking about which I would have some disagreement
00:17:32 with consciousness yes what's the most interesting part of consciousness of us humans is consciousness is the thing I
00:17:39 think that's the most interesting thing about you and then you're saying that there's other entities throughout the universe
00:17:46 I could imagine I can well imagine that the architecture that supports our consciousness again has no patent on
00:17:56 consciousness it's the in case you have an interesting thought here there's folks perhaps in philosophy called Pan
00:18:02 cyclists that believe consciousness underlies everything it is one of the fundamental laws of the universe do you
00:18:08 have a sense that that could possibly fit into I don't know the answer that question one part of that belief system
00:18:17 is Ghia which is that there's a kind of conscious life force about our planet and you know I encountered these things
00:18:24 before I don't quite know what to make of them I my own experience and I'm I'll be 69 in about two months and I have
00:18:32 spent all my adulthood thinking about the way that mathematics interacts with nature and with us to try to understand
00:18:41 nature and all I can tell you from all of my integrated experience is that there is something extraordinarily
00:18:48 mysterious to me about our universe this is something an Einstein said of from his life experience as a scientist and
00:19:00 this mysteriousness almost feels like the universe is our parent it's a very strange thing perhaps to hear science
00:19:08 say it scientists say but there are just so many strange coincidences that you just get a sense that something is going on
00:19:17 while I interrupted you in terms of compressing what we're down to we consented at the speed of light yes so
00:19:25 so the first thing is I would argue that it's probably very likely that artificial intelligence ultimately will
00:19:32 develop something like consciousness something that for us will probably be indistinguishable from consciousness so
00:19:40 that's what I meant by our biological processing equipment that we carry up here probably had does not hold a patent
00:19:46 on consciousness because it's really about the data streams I mean that's as far as I can tell that's what we are we
00:19:53 are self actuating self learning data streams that to me Lee is most accurate way I can tell you what I have seen in
00:20:00 my lifetime about what humans are at the level of consciousness so if that's the case then you just need to have an
00:20:04 architecture that supports that information processing so let's assume that that's true
00:20:11 that that in fact what we call consciousness is really about a very peculiar kind of data stream if that's
00:20:21 the case then if you can export that to a piece of hardware something metal electronic what-have-you then you
00:20:30 certainly will ultimately that kind of consciousness could get to Mars very quickly it doesn't have our problems you
00:20:37 can engineer the body as I say there's a send it to the speed of light well that one is a more difficult one because that
00:20:48 now goes beyond just a matter of having a data stream and so now the preservation of the information in the
00:20:55 data stream and so unless you can build something that's like a super super super version of the way the internet
00:21:00 works because most people aren't aware that the Internet itself is actually a miracle it's based on a technology
00:21:07 called message packaging so if you could expand nc8 message packaging in some way to preserve the information that's in
00:21:13 the data stream then maybe your dream becomes true can we you mentioned with artificial intelligence sort of us human
00:21:22 beings not having a monopoly on consciousness does the idea of artificial and
00:21:33 systems computational systems being able to basically replacing us humans scare you excite you what do you think about
00:21:40 so I'm gonna tell you about a conversation I once had with Eric Schmidt I was sitting at a meeting with
00:21:47 him and he was a few feet away and he turned to me and he said something like you know Jim and maybe a decade or so
00:21:53 we're gonna have computers that do what you do and my response was not unless they can dream because there's something
00:22:00 about the human the way that we humans actually generate creativity it's somehow I get this sense of my lived
00:22:07 experience and watching creative people that somehow connected to the irrational parts of what goes on in our head yes
00:22:13 and dreaming is part of that irrationally so unless you can build a piece of artificial intelligence that
00:22:18 dreams I have a strong suspicion that you will not get something that it will fully be conscious by a definition that
00:22:26 I would accept for example imagine dreaming you've played around with some out-there fascinating ideas how do you
00:22:36 think when and we'll start diving into the world of the very small ideas of supersymmetry and all that in terms of
00:22:44 visualization in terms of how do you think about it how do you dream of it how do you come up with ideas in that
00:22:51 fascinating mysterious space so in my workspace which is basically where I am charged with coming upon on coming up on
00:23:02 a mathematical palette with new ideas that will help me understand the structure of nature and hopefully help
00:23:07 all of us understand structure of nature I've observed several different ways in which my creativity expresses itself
00:23:13 there's one mode which looks pretty normal which I sort of think of as the Chinese water torture mythos drop drop
00:23:20 drop you get more and more information and suddenly it all congeals and you get a clearer picture and so that's the kind
00:23:27 of a standard way of working and I think that's how most people think about the way technical people solve problems that
00:23:35 it's kind of you accumulate this body of information at a certain point you synthesize it and then boom there's
00:23:41 something new but I've also observed in my self and other scientists that there are other ways that we are creative creative
00:23:47 and these other ways to me are actually far more powerful I first personally experienced this when I was a freshman
00:23:55 at MIT live over in Baker house right across the campus and I was in a calculus course 1801 is called at MIT
00:24:04 and calculus comes in two different flavors one of them is called differential calculus the other is
00:24:09 called integral calculus differential calculus is the calculus that Newton invented to describe motion since our
00:24:16 integral calculus was probably invented about seventeen hundred years earlier by Archimedes but we didn't know that when
00:24:23 I was a freshman but so that's what you study as a student and the differential calculus part of the course was to me I
00:24:31 wouldn't how do I say this it was something that that by the driptip method you could sort of figure it out
00:24:38 now the integral part of calculus I could memorize the formula that was not the formula that was not the problem the
00:24:46 problem was why in my own mind why do these formulae work and because of that when I was in the part of the calculus
00:24:55 course where we had to do multiple substitutions to solve integrals I had a lot of difficulty I was emotionally
00:25:03 involved in my education because this is where I think the passion emotion comes to and it caused an emotional crisis
00:25:10 that I was having these difficulties understanding the integral part of calculus so why other why that's right
00:25:15 the why of it not the remember rote memorization of fact but the why of it why does this work and so one night I
00:25:23 was over in my dormitory room in Baker house I was trying to do a calculus problem set I was getting nowhere I got
00:25:32 a terrific headache I went to sleep and had this very strange dream and when I woke walk awakened I could do 3 & 4
00:25:40 substitutions and integrals with relative ease now this to me wasn't an astounding experience because I had
00:25:50 never before my life understood that one subconscious is actually capable of being harnessed to do mathematics
00:25:56 I experienced it this and I've experienced this more than once so this was just the first time why I remember
00:26:02 it so so that's why when it comes to like really wickedly tough problems I think that the kind of creativity that
00:26:10 you need to solve them is probably this second variety which comes somehow from dreaming if you think again I told you
00:26:19 I'm Russian so we romanticize suffering but do you think part of that equation is the
00:26:26 suffering leading up to that dreaming so the suffering is I am convinced that this kind of creative sick the second
00:26:34 mode of creativity as I like to call it I'm convinced that this second mode of creativity is in fact that suffering is
00:26:44 a kind of crucible that triggers it because the mine I think is struggling to get out of this and the only the only
00:26:51 way the heaters actually solved the problem and even though you're not consciously solving problems something
00:26:57 is going on and I've talked about to a few other people in there are there similar stories and so I the way I guess
00:27:04 so I think about it is it's a little bit by like the way that thermonuclear weapons work and if you know how they
00:27:11 work but a thermonuclear weapon is actually two bombs there's an atomic bomb which sort of Delta compression and
00:27:15 then you have a fusion bomb that goes off and somehow that emotional pressure I think acts like the first stage of a
00:27:22 thermonuclear weapon that's when we get really big thoughts the analogy between thermonuclear weapons and the
00:27:30 subconscious the the connection there is  at least visually that's kind of interesting well I there may be fried it
00:27:41 would have a few things to say well part of it is probably based on my own trajectory through life my father was in
00:27:47 the Army for us for the US Army for 27 years and so I started my life out on military bases and so a lot of probably
00:27:55 the things that wander around in my subconscious are connected to the experience I apologize for all the
00:28:06 but you're encouraging by me answering the stupid questions no they're not stupid you know your father was in the army
00:28:18 what do you think about any other grass Tyson recently wrote a book on interlinking the the progress of science
00:28:30 to sort of the aspirations of our military endeavors and DARPA funding and so on what do you think about war in
00:28:37 general do you think we'll always have war do you think we'll always I am conflict in the world I'm not sure that
00:28:44 we're going to be able to afford to have war always because if strictly financially speaking no not in terms of
00:28:53 Finance but in terms of consequences so if you look at technology today you can have non state actors acquired
00:29:01 technology for example bioterrorism which whose impact is roughly speaking equivalent to what it used to take
00:29:10 nations to an impart on a population I think the cost of war is ultimately it's gonna be a little I think it's gonna
00:29:16 work a little bit like the Cold War you know we survived 50 60 years as a species with these weapons that are so
00:29:25 terrible that they could have actually ended our form of life on this planet but it didn't why didn't it well it's a
00:29:32 very bizarre and interesting thing but it was called mutually assured destruction and so the cost was so great
00:29:38 that people eventually figured out that you can't really use these things which is kind of interesting because if you
00:29:43 read the history about the development of nuclear weapons businesses actually realized this pretty quickly I think it
00:29:49 was maybe Schrodinger who said that these things are not really weapons their political and implements and not
00:29:55 weapons because the cost is so high and if you take that example and spread it out to the kind of technological
00:30:03 development we're seeing now outside of nuclear physics but I picked the example of biology I could well imagine that
00:30:10 there would be material science sorts of equivalents that across a broad front of Technology you
00:30:16 take that experience from nuclear weapons and the picture that I see is that it would be so there would be
00:30:22 possible to develop technologies that are so terrible that you couldn't use them because the costs are too high and
00:30:29 that might cure us and many people have argued that actually it prevented nuclear weapons have prevented more
00:30:37 military conflict then it certainly froze the conflict domain it's an interesting that nowadays it was with
00:30:46 the removal of the threat of mutually assured destruction that other forces took over in our geopolitics do you have
00:30:57 worries that of existential threats of nuclear weapons or other technologies like artificial intelligence do you
00:31:04 think we humans will tend to figure out how to not blow ourselves up I don't know quite frankly this is something I
00:31:15 thought about and I'm not I mean so I'm a spectator in the sense that as a scientist I collect and collate data so
00:31:23 I've been doing that all my life and looking at my species and it's not clear to me that we are going to avoid I could
00:31:34 a catastrophic self-induced ending are you optimistic as a not as a scientist but as a I well I would say I would say
00:31:45 I wouldn't bet against us beautifully put let's dive into the the world are very small if we could first heard it
00:31:55 what are the basic particles either experimentally observed or hypothesized by physicists so as we physicists look
00:32:03 at the universe you can first of all there are two big buckets of particles that is the smallest objects that we are
00:32:10 able to currently mathematically conceive and then experimentally verify that these ideas have an accent of
00:32:18 accuracies them so one of those buckets we call matter these are things like electrons things that are like quarks
00:32:26 which are particles that exist inside of protons and there's a whole family of these things there are in fact 18 corks and
00:32:35 apparently six electron like objects that we call leptons so that's one bucket the other bucket that we see both
00:32:42 in our mathematics as well as in our experiment to equipment are what our set of particles that you can call force
00:32:49 carriers the most familiar force carrier is the photon the particle of light that allows you to see me in fact it's the
00:32:55 same object that carries electric repulsion between like charges from science fiction we have the object
00:33:02 called the graviton which is talked about a lot in science fiction and Star Trek but the graviton is also a
00:33:08 mathematical object that we physicists have known about essentially since Einstein wrote his theory of general
00:33:15 relativity there are four forces in nature the fundamental forces there is the gravitational force its carrier is
00:33:22 the graviton there are three other forces in nature the electromagnetic force the strong nuclear force and the
00:33:27 weak nuclear force and each one of these forces has at one or more carriers the photon is the carrier of the
00:33:34 electromagnetic force the strong nuclear force actually has eight carriers they're called gluons and then the weak
00:33:39 nuclear force has three carriers they're called the W plus W minus and Z bosons so those are the things that both in
00:33:48 mathematics and in experiments the most by the way the most precise experiments were a ever as a species able to conduct
00:33:54 is about measuring the accuracy of these ideas and we know that at least to one part in a billion these ideas are right
00:34:02 so first of all you've made it sound both elegant and simple but is it crazy to you that there is force carriers like
00:34:13 is that supposed to be a trivial idea to think about if we think about photons gluons that there's four fundamental
00:34:22 forces of physics and then those forces are expressed there's carriers of those forces like is
00:34:29 that a kind of trivial thing it's not a trivial thing at all in fact it was a puzzle for Sir Isaac Newton because he's
00:34:36 the first person to give us basically physics before Isaac Newton physics didn't exist
00:34:41 what did exist was called Nath philosophy so discussions about using the methods of classical philosophy to
00:34:47 the understand nature natural philosophy so the Greeks we call them scientists but they were natural philosophers
00:34:54 physics doesn't get born until Newton writes the Principia one of the things that puzzled him was how gravity works
00:35:03 because if you read very carefully what he writes he basically says and I'm paraphrasing badly but he basically says
00:35:10 that someone who thinks deeply about this subject would find it inconceivable that what an object in one place place
00:35:18 our location can magically reach out and affect another object with nothing intervening and so it puzzled him
00:35:25 there's a puzzle you what doesn't in a distance I mean not as it would it would it would accept that I am a physicist
00:35:32 and we have long ago resolved this issue and the resolution came about through a second great physicist most people heard
00:35:39 of a Newton most people have heard of Einstein but between the two of them there was another extraordinarily great
00:35:44 physicist a man named James Clark Maxwell and Maxwell between these two other giants taught us about electric
00:35:53 and magnetic forces and it's from his equations that one can figure out that there's a carrier called the photon so
00:36:01 this was resolved for physicists around 1860 or so so what are bosons and fermions and hey John's
00:36:10 elementary and composites sure so earlier I said you've UNK it's you have got two buckets if you want to try to
00:36:16 build a universe you have to start off without things on these two buckets so you got to have things that's the matter
00:36:22 and then you have to either have other objects that act on them to cause those things to cohere to fixed finite
00:36:29 patterns because you need those fixed finite patterns as building blocks so that's the way our universe looks to
00:36:35 people like me now the building blocks do different things so let's go back to these two buckets again let me start
00:36:41 with a bucket containing the particle of light let me imagine I'm in a dusty room with two flashlights and I have one
00:36:49 flashlight which I direct directly in front of me and then I have you stand over to say my left and then we both
00:36:54 take our flashlights and turn them on make sure the beams go right through each other and the beams do just that
00:36:58 they go right through each other they don't bounce off of each other the reason the room has to be dusty is
00:37:02 because we want to see the light because I'll let the rule dust wasn't there we wouldn't actually see the light until it
00:37:07 got to the other wall right so you see the beam because it's dust in the air but the do things actually pass right
00:37:13 through each other they literally pass right through they don't affect each other at all when acts like that one's
00:37:20 not there things there are the particle flight is the simplest example that shows that behavior that's a boson now
00:37:28 let's imagine that I have to wear in the same dusty room and this time you have a bucket of balls and I have a bucket of
00:37:34 balls and we try to throw them so that they pass so that we get something like a beam throwing them fast right if they
00:37:41 collide they don't just pass through each other they bounce off of each other now that's mostly because they have
00:37:46 electric charge an electric charge is like charges repel but mathematically I know how to turn off the electric charge
00:37:52 if you do that you'll finally still repel and it's because they are these things we call fermions so this is how
00:37:59 you distinguish the things that are in the two buckets they are either bosons or fermions which of them and maybe you
00:38:08 can mention the most popular of the boson the most recently discovered she's it's like yeah it's like when I was in
00:38:16 high school and there was a really popular major rift her name is her name is the Higgs particle these days
00:38:26 can you describe which which which of the bosons and fermions have been discovered hypothesized which have been
00:38:31 experimentally value she was still out there right so the two buckets that I've actually described to you have all been
00:38:41 first hypothesized and then verified by observation with the Higgs boson being the most recent one of these things we
00:38:49 haven't actually verified the graviton interestingly enough we mathematically we have an expectation that gravitas
00:38:56 like this but we've not performed an experiment to show that this is an accurate idea that nature uses so
00:39:02 something has to be a carrier for the force of gravity exactly because maybe something way more mysterious than we so
00:39:08 when you say is that would it be like the other particles force carriers in some ways
00:39:19 yes but in other ways no it turned out that the graviton is also if you look at I in Stein's theory he taught us about
00:39:26 this thing he calls space-time which is you know if you try to imagine it you can sort of think of it as kind of a
00:39:33 rubber surface that's one popular depiction of space-time it's not an accurate depiction because the only
00:39:38 accuracy is actually in the calculus that he uses but that's close enough so if you have a sheet of rubber you can
00:39:44 wave it you can actually form a wave on it space-time is enough like that so that when space-time oscillates you
00:39:52 create these waves these ways carry energy we expect them to carry energy in quanta that's what a graviton is it's a
00:39:58 wave in space-time and so the fact that we have seen the waves with LIGO over the course of the last three years and
00:40:06 we've recently use gravitational wave Observatory to watch colliding black holes and neutron stars and all sorts of
00:40:12 really cool stuff out there so we know the waves exist but in order to know that graviton exists you have to prove
00:40:19 that these waves carry energy in energy packets and that's what we don't have the technology to do yet and  perhaps
00:40:27 briefly jumping to a philosophical question does it make sense to you that gravity is so much weaker than the other
00:40:39 forces no it's now you see now you've touched on a very deep mystery about physics there are a lot of such
00:40:45 questions of physics about why things are as they are and as someone who believes that there are some things that
00:40:53 certainly are coincidences like you could ask the same question about well why are the planets at the orbits that
00:40:59 they are around the Sun the answer turns out there is no good reason it's just an accident so there are things in nature
00:41:05 that have that character and perhaps the strength of the weak of the various forces it's like that well the other
00:41:10 thing we don't know that that's the case and there may be some deep reasons about why the forces are ordered as they are
00:41:17 where the weakest forces gravity the next week is forces the weak interaction the weak nuclear force then there's
00:41:22 electromagnetism this we don't really have a good understanding of why this is the
00:41:29 ordering of the forces some of the fascinating work you've done is in the space of supersymmetry symmetry in
00:41:37 general can you describe first of all what is supersymmetry ah yes so you remove the two buckets I told you about
00:41:43 perhaps earlier I said there are two buckets in our universe so now I want you to think about drawing a a pie that
00:41:53 has four quadrants so I want you to cut the piece of pie in fourths so one quadrant I'm going to put all the
00:41:59 buckets that we talked about like that are like the electronic quarks in a different quadrant I am going to put all
00:42:04 the force carriers the other two quadrants are empty now if you I showed you a picture of that you'd see a circle
00:42:11 there would be a bunch of stuff in one upper quadrant and stuff in others and then I would ask you a question does
00:42:20 that look symmetrical to you no no and that's exactly right because we humans actually have a very deeply programmed
00:42:29 sense of symmetry it's something that is part of that mystery of the universe so how would you make it symmetrical one
00:42:36 way you could is by saying those two empty quadrants had things in them not so and if you do that that's
00:42:42 supersymmetry so that's what I understood when I was a graduate student here in at MIT in 1975 weeding the idea
00:42:50 when the mathematics of this was first being born supersymmetry was actually born in the Ukraine in the late 60s but
00:42:57 we have this thing called the iron curtain so we Westerners didn't know about it but by the early 70s
00:43:03 independently there were scientists in the West who had rediscovered supersymmetry symmetry bruno Cimino and
00:43:11 julius vests were their names so this was around 71 or 72 when this happened I started graduate school in 73
00:43:19 so around 74 75 I was trying to figure out how to write a thesis so that I could have become a physicist the rest
00:43:22 of my life I did a lot of great advisor professor James Young who had taught me a number
00:43:31 of things about electrons and weak forces and those sorts of things but I decided that if I was going to
00:43:42 have a really opportunity to maximize my chances of being successful I should strike it out in a direction
00:43:48 that other people were not studying and so as a consequence I surveyed ideas that were going that were being
00:43:55 developed and I came across the idea of supersymmetry and it was so the mathematics was so remarkable that I
00:44:03 just it bowled me over I actually have two undergraduate degrees my first undergraduate degree is actually
00:44:09 mathematics and my second is physics even though I always wanted to be a physicist plan a which involved getting
00:44:17 good grades was mathematics I was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school but my heart was in
00:44:24 physics if we could take a small digression what's to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics that
00:44:31 you've encountered in this interplay between math and physics it's the idea of symmetry the fact that our innate
00:44:41 sense of symmetry want wines of aligning with just incredible mathematics to me is the most beautiful thing it's very
00:44:51 strange but true that if symmetries were perfect we would not exist and so even though we have these very powerful ideas
00:44:56 about balance in the universe in some sense it's only when you break those balances that you get creatures like
00:45:02 humans and objects like planets and stars so although they are a scaffold for reality they cannot be the entirety
00:45:14 of reality so I I'm kind of naturally attracted to parts of Science and Technology where symmetry plays note a
00:45:22 dominant role and not just I guess symmetry as you said but the the magic happens when you break the symmetry the
00:45:28 magic happens when you break the symmetry okay so diving right back in you mentioned four quadrants yes - - or
00:45:36 filled with stuff what can we do buckets yeah and then there's crazy mathematical thing ideas for filling the other two
00:45:44 what are those things so earlier the way I described these two buckets as I gave you a story that started out
00:45:51 by putting us in a dusty room with two flashlights and I said turn on your flashlight I'll turn on mine the beans
00:45:57 will go through each other and the beams are composed of force carriers called photons they carry the electromagnetic force and
00:46:04 they pass right through each other so imagine looking at the mathematics of such an object which you don't imagine
00:46:11 people like me do that so you take that mathematics and then you ask yourself a question you see mathematics is a palette it's
00:46:21 just like a a musical composer is able to construct to construct variations on a theme well a piece of mathematics in
00:46:27 the hand of a physicist something that we can construct variations on so even though the mathematics that Maxwell gave
00:46:36 us about light we know how to construct very issues on that and one of the very issues you can construct is to say
00:46:43 suppose you have a force carrier for electromagnetism that behaves like an electron that in that it would bounce
00:46:49 off of another one it's so that's changing a mathematical term in an equation so if you did that you would
00:46:57 have a force carrier so you would say first it belongs in this force carrying bucket but it's got this property of
00:47:01 bouncing off like electrons and so you say well gee wait no that's not the right bucket so you're forced to
00:47:06 actually put it in one of these empty quadrants so those sorts of things we basically we give them so the photon
00:47:15 mathematically can be accompanied by a photino it's the thing that carries a force but has the rule of bouncing off
00:47:22 in a similar manner you could start with an electron and you say okay so write down the mathematical is electron I know
00:47:28 I want to do that physicists name Dirac first told us how to do that back in the nineteen late 20s early 30s so take that
00:47:35 mathematics and then you say let's let me look at that mathematics and find out what in the mathematics caused us two
00:47:41 electrons to bounce off of each other even if I turn off the electrical charge so I could do that and now let me change
00:47:48 that mathematical term so now I have something that carries electrical charge but if you take two of them I'm sorry if
00:47:53 you turn their charges off they'll pass through each other so that puts things in the other quadrant and those things
00:48:00 we till we tend to call we put the Essen in front of their name so in the lower quadrant here we have
00:48:06 electrons and this now newly filled quadrant we have select rods and the quadrant over here we had corks over
00:48:14 here we have squirts so now we've got this balance pie and that's basically what I understood as a graduate student
00:48:21 in 1975 about this idea of supersymmetry that it was going to fill up these two quadrants of the pie in a way that no
00:48:27 one had ever thought about before so I was amazed that no one else at MIT found this an interesting idea
00:48:34 so that's it led to my becoming the first person in MIT to really study supersymmetry this is 1975 76 77 and in 77 I wrote the
00:48:45 first PhD thesis in the physics department on this idea because I just I must draw to the balance drawn to the
00:48:56 symmetry so what boundary what does that first of all is this fundamentally a mathematical idea so how much
00:49:04 experimental and we'll have this theme it's an really interesting one when you explore the worlds of the small and in
00:49:11 your new book talking about approving is that right right that will also talk about there's this theme of kind of
00:49:18 starting and exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics and then seeking for ways to experiment to validate them
00:49:25 where do you put some supersymmetry and that's it's closer than string theory it is not yet been validated in some sense
00:49:34 you mentioned Einstein so let's go there for a moment in our book proofing Einstein right we actually do talk about
00:49:40 the fact that Albert Einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations which were very different from Newton's equations and
00:49:47 describing gravity these equations made some predictions that were different from Newton's predictions and it
00:49:52 actually made three different predictions one of them was not actually a prediction but a post diction because
00:49:58 it was known that mercury was not orbiting the Sun in the way that Newton would have told you
00:50:03 and so I science Theory actually makes describes mercury orbiting in the way that it was observed as opposed to what
00:50:10 Newton would have told you that was one prediction the second prediction that came out of the theory of general relativity which
00:50:20 Einstein wrote in 1915 was that if you if so let me describe an experiment and come back to it suppose like a glass of
00:50:29 water and I filled it up fill the glass up and then I moved the glass slowly back and forth between our two faces it
00:50:37 would appear to me like your face was moving even though you weren't moving I mean it's actually and what's causing it
00:50:43 is because the light gets bent through the glass has it passes from your face to my eye so Einstein in his 1915 theory
00:50:53 of general relativity found out that gravity has the same effect on light as that glass of water it would cause beams
00:51:01 of light tube in now Newton also knew this but Einstein's prediction was that light would Bend twice as much and so
00:51:08 here's a mathematical idea now how do you actually prove it well you've got to watch yes just a quick pause on that
00:51:16 just the language you're using he found out I can say he did a calculation it's a really interesting notion that the one
00:51:23 of the most and one of the beautiful things about this universe is you can do a calculation and and combined with some
00:51:30 of that magical intuition that physicists have actually predict what would be was possible to experiment to
00:51:39 validate that's correct so he found out in the sense that there seems to be something here and mathematically should
00:51:47 bend gravity should bend like this amount and so therefore that's something that could be potentially and then come
00:51:52 up with an experiment that can be validated right and that's the way that actually modern physics deeply
00:52:00 fundamental modern physics is how it works you earlier we spoke about the Higgs boson so why did we go looking for
00:52:10 the answer is they had back in the late 60s and early 70s some people wrote some equations and the equations predicted
00:52:19 this so then we went looking for it so  none supersymmetry for a second there's these things called
00:52:27 Adinkra symbols strange little grass yes you referred to them as revealing something like binary code yes
00:52:34 underlying reality yes or so can you describe these grout what are they what what what are these beautiful little
00:52:42 strange graphs well first of all the Dinkas are an invention of mine and together with a colleague named Michael
00:52:49 Fox in 2005 we were looking at equations well so the story's a little bit more complicated and it'll take too long it's
00:52:54 explained all the details but the Reader's Digest version is that we were looking at these equations and we
00:53:01 figured out that all the data in a certain class of equations could be put in pictures and the pictures what do
00:53:07 they look like whether just they're just little balls you have black balls and white balls those stands for those two
00:53:15 buckets by the way that we talked about in reality the white balls or things that are like particles of light the
00:53:21 black balls are like electrons and then they you can draw lines connecting these balls and these lines are deeply
00:53:28 mathematical objects and there's no way for me to I have no physical model for telling you what the lines are but as a
00:53:36 math if you were a mathematician and with your technical phrase saying this is the orbit of the representation and
00:53:41 the action of the symmetry generators mathematicians would understand that nobody in there else in their right mind
00:53:48 was so let's not go there so we but we figured out that the data that was in the equation suddenly it was in these
00:53:54 funny pictures that we could draw and so that was stunning but it also was encouraging because there aren't
00:54:02 problems with the equations which I had first learned about in 1979 when I was down at Harvard and I went out to
00:54:10 Caltech for the first time and working with a great scientist by the name of John Schwarz there are problems in the
00:54:16 equations we don't notice all and so one of the things about solving problems that you don't know how to solve is that
00:54:22 beating your head against the brick wall is probably not a good philosophy about how to solve it so what do you need to
00:54:28 do you need to change your sense of of reference your frame of reference your perspective so when I saw these funny
00:54:37 pictures I thought gee that might be a way to solve these problems with equations that we don't know how to do
00:54:43 so that was for me when the first attractions is that I now had an alternative language to try to attack a
00:54:51 set of mathematical problems but I quickly realized that a this mathematical language was not known by
00:54:59 mathematicians which makes it pretty interesting because now you have to actually teach mathematicians about a
00:55:04 piece of mathematics because that's how they make their living and the great thing about working mathematicians of
00:55:09 course is the rigor with which they examine ideas so they make your ideas better then they start out so I start
00:55:15 working with a group of mathematicians and there's in that collaboration that we figured out that these funny pictures
00:55:21 had error correcting codes buried in them so can you can talk about what our error correcting codes are sure so the
00:55:29 simplest way to talk about error correcting codes is first of all to talk about digital information digital
00:55:39 information is basically strings of ones and zeros they're called bits so now let's imagine that I want to send you
00:55:48 some bits well maybe I can show you pictures but maybe it's a rainy day or maybe the windows in your house are
00:55:57 foggy so sometimes when I show you a zero you might interpret it as a one or other times when I show you one you
00:56:06 might interpret it as a zero so if that's the case that means when I try to send you this data it comes to you in
00:56:12 corrupted form and so the challenge is how do you get it to be uncorrupted in the 1940s a computer scientist named
00:56:22 hemming address the problem how do you reliably transmit digital information and what he came up with with was a
00:56:29 brilliant idea the way to solve it is that you take the data that you want to send and then once
00:56:35 in your strings of 1 0 is your favorite string and then you've dumped more ones and zeros then but you dump them in in a
00:56:41 particular pattern and this particular pattern is what a Hamming code is all about so it's an error correcting code
00:56:48 because if you the person at the other end knows what the pattern is supposed to be they can figure out when once got
00:56:53 changed the zeros so it turned out that our strange little objects that came from looking at the
00:57:00 equations that we couldn't solve it turns out that when you look at them deeply enough you find out they're
00:57:06 strictly that they have ones and zeros back buried in them but even more astoundingly that ones and zeroes are
00:57:11 not there randomly they are in the pattern of error correcting codes so this was an astounding thing that when
00:57:19 we first got this result and tried to publish it it took us three years to convince other physicists that we
00:57:24 weren't crazy mm-hmm eventually we were able to publish it I in this collaboration of mathematicians and
00:57:31 other physicists and so every since then I have actually been looking at the mathematics of these objects trying to
00:57:38 still understand properties of the equations and I want to understand the properties equations because I want to
00:57:43 be able to try things like electrons so it's just like a two step remove process of trying to get back to reality so what
00:57:49 would you say is the most beautiful property of these dinkar graphs objects what do you think what by the way the
00:57:59 word symbols what do you think of them these simple graphs are they objects or their haha work with mathematics like me
00:58:11 our mathematical concepts are we often refer to them as objects because they feel like real things even though you
00:58:18 can't see them or touch them there's so much part of your interior life that it is as if you could so we often refer to
00:58:26 these things as objects even though there's nothing objective about them and what is this a single graph represent
00:58:32 and so ok so the simplest of these graphs has to have one white ball in one black ball that's that balance that we
00:58:39 talked about earlier we want to balance out the quadrants well you can't do this you have a black ball and white ball so
00:58:45 the simplest of these objects looks like two little balls one black one white connected by a single line and whether
00:58:52 it's talking about is as I said a deep mathematical property related to symmetry you've mentioned the air
00:58:57 correcting codes but is there a particular beautiful property that stands out to you about these objects
00:59:02 they just find yeah they're very yes very early on in the development yes there is
00:59:11 the craziest thing about these to me is that when you look at physics and try to write equations where information gets
00:59:20 transmitted reliably if you're in one of these super symmetrical systems with this extra symmetry that doesn't happen
00:59:25 unless there's an error correcting code present so as as if the universe says you don't really transmit information
00:59:32 unless there's something about an error correcting code this to me is the craziest thing that I've ever personally
00:59:38 encountered in my research and it actually got me to wondering how this could come about because the only place
00:59:45 in nature that we know about error correcting codes is genetics and in genetics we think it was evolution that
00:59:52 causes air correcting codes to be in genomes and so does that mean that there was some kind of form of evolution
00:59:57 acting on the mathematical laws of the physics of our universe this is a very bizarre and strange idea and something
01:00:03 I've wondered about from time to time since making these discoveries do you think such an idea could be fundamental
01:00:10 or is it emergent throughout all the different kinds of systems I don't know whether it's fundamental and I probably
01:00:18 will not live to find out this is gonna be the work of probably some future either mathematicians physicists to
01:00:23 figure out what these things actually mean we have to talk a bit about the magical the mysterious string theory the
01:00:32 purse string theory sure there's still maybe this aspect of it which is there still for me from an outsider's
01:00:40 perspective of this fascinating heated debate on the status of string theory can you clarify this debate perhaps
01:00:49 articulating the various views and say where you land on it so first of all I mean I doubt that I will be able to say
01:00:55 anything to clarify clarify the debate around string theory for for general audience part of the reason is because
01:01:05 string theory is a has been something I've never seen the erecto physics do it is broken out into consciousness of the
01:01:12 general public before we're finished you see string theory doesn't actually exist because when we use the word
01:01:18 theory we mean a their set of attributes in particular it means that you have an overarching
01:01:25 paradigm that explains what it is that you're doing no such overarching paradigm exists or string theory what
01:01:32 string theory is currently is an enormous lean large mutually reinforcing collection of mathematical facts in
01:01:39 which we can find no contradictions we don't know why it's there but we can certainly say that without challenge now
01:01:46 just because you find a piece of mathematics doesn't mean that it's applies to nature and in fact there has
01:01:53 been a very heated debate about whether string theory is some sort of hysteria among the community of theoretical
01:02:01 physicists or whether it has something fundamental to say about our universe we don't yet know the answer to that
01:02:09 question but those of us who study string theory will tell you are things like string theory has been
01:02:15 extraordinarily productive in getting us to think more deeply even about mathematics that's not string theory but
01:02:21 the kind of mathematics that we've used to describe elementary particles they have been spin-offs from string theory
01:02:27 and this has been going on now for two decades almost that I have allowed us for example to more accurately calculate
01:02:34 the force between electrons with the presence of quantum mechanics this is not something you hear about in the
01:02:40 public there are other similar things the kind of that kind of property I just told you about is what to call weak
01:02:47 strong duality and it comes directly from string theory there are other things such as a property called
01:02:58 holography which allows one to to take equations and look at them on the boundary of a space and then to know
01:03:04 information about inside space without actually doing calculations there this has come directly from string theory so
01:03:10 there are there are a number of direct mathematical effects that we learn this string theory but we take these ideas
01:03:17 and look at math that we already know and we find sudden we're more powerful this is pretty good indication there's
01:03:22 something interesting going on with string theory itself so it's the early days of a powerful mathematical
01:03:27 framework that's what we have right now what are the big first of all those most people will probably that which as
01:03:35 you said most general public would know actually what string theory is which is a at the highest level which is a
01:03:42 fascinating fact well string theory is what they do on the Big Bang Theory right one can you maybe describe what is
01:03:53 string theory and two what are the open challenges so what is string theory well let the simplest explanation I can
01:04:05 provide is to go back and ask water particles which is the question you first ask me what's the smallest thing
01:04:15 yeah what's the smallest thing so particles one way I try to describe particles to people a star I want you to
01:04:25 imagine a little ball and I want you to let this size of that ball shrink into it has no extent whatsoever but it still
01:04:34 has the mass of the ball that's actually what Newton was working with when he first invented physics he's the real
01:04:40 inventor of the massive particle which is this idea that underlies all of physics so that's where we start it's a
01:04:48 mathematical construct that you get by taking a limit of things that you know so what's a string well in the same
01:04:55 analogy I would say now I want you to start with a piece of spaghetti so we all know what that looks like and now I
01:05:03 want you to let the thickness of the spaghetti shrink until it has no thickness mathematically I mean words
01:05:10 this makes no sense mathematically this actually works and you get this mathematical object out it has
01:05:16 properties that are like spaghetti it can wiggle and jiggle but it can also move collectively like a piece of spaghetti
01:05:24 then it's the mathematics of those sorts of objects that constitutes string theory and does the multi-dimensional 11
01:05:34 dimensional however many dimensional more than four dimension is that a crazy idea to you is that is that the stranger
01:05:42 aspect of strength not really and also partly because of my own research so earlier we talked about
01:05:49 a dink these strange symbols that we've discovered inside the equations it turns
01:05:56 out that to a very large extent a tinker's don't really care about the number of dimensions they kind of have
01:06:00 an internal mathematical consistency that allows them to be manifest in many different dimensions since supersymmetry
01:06:08 is a part of string theory then this same property you would expect to be inherited by string theory however
01:06:14 another little-known fact which is not in the public debate is that there are actually strings that are only four
01:06:20 dimensional this is something that was discovered at the end of the 80s by three different groups of physicists
01:06:28 working independently I and my friend Warren Siegel who were at the University of Maryland at the time were able to
01:06:33 prove that there's mathematics it looks totally four-dimensional and yet it's a string there was a group in Germany that
01:06:40 used slightly different mathematics but they found the same rizzo and then there was a group at Cornell who using yet a
01:06:46 third piece of mathematics found the same yourself so the the fact that extra dimensions is so why they talked about
01:06:55 in the public is partly a function of how the public has come to understand string theory and how it's the story has
01:06:59 been told to them but there are alternatives you don't know about if we could talk about maybe experiments of
01:07:09 validation and you you're the co-author of a recently published book proving Einstein right the the human story of it
01:07:18 - the daring expeditions that changed how we look at the universe do you see echoes of the early days of general
01:07:27 relativity in the 1910s - the more stretched out - string theory I just nodded I do and that's one reason
01:07:35 why I was happy to focus on on the story of how Einstein became a global superstar earlier in our discussion we
01:07:50 went over the the his history where in 1915 he he came up this piece of mathematics used it to do some calculations and then
01:07:57 made a prediction yes but making a prediction is not enough someone's got to go out and measure and
01:08:05 so string theory is in that in-between zone now for Einstein it was from 1915 to 1919 1950 he makes the makes the
01:08:15 correct prediction by the way he made an incorrect prediction about the same thing in 1911 but he corrected himself
01:08:22 in 1915 and by 1919 the first pieces of experimental observational data became available to say yes he's not wrong and
01:08:35 by 1922 the the argument that based on observation was overwhelming that he was not wrong he described what special and
01:08:42 general relativity are just briefly sure since and what prediction Einstein made and maybe maybe some or memorable moment
01:08:55 from the human journey of trying to prove this thing right she was incredible right so I'm very fortunate
01:09:04 to have worked with a talented novelist who wanted to write a book that coincided with a book I wanted to write
01:09:13 about how science kind of feels if you're a person guess it's actually people who do science even though that
01:09:21 may not be obvious to everyone so for me I wanted to write this book for a couple of reasons I wanted young people to
01:09:30 understand that the seeming alien Giants that lived before them were just as human as they are you get married you
01:09:36 get divorced again married they get worse they do terrible things they do great things they're people they're just
01:09:43 people like you and so that part of telling the story allowed me to get that out there for both young people interest
01:09:48 in the sciences as well as the public but the other part of the story is I wanted to open up sort of what what it
01:10:00 was like now I'm a scientist and so I will not pretend to be a great writer I understand a lot about mathematics and
01:10:06 I've even created my own mathematic that you know it's kind of a weird thing to be able to do but in order to tell
01:10:15 the story you really have to have an incredible master of the narrative and my that was my co-author Kathy Pelletier
01:10:23 who is a novelist we so we formed this conjoined brain I used to call us she's the call us
01:10:30 professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle my expression for us was that we were a conjoined brain to tell this story and
01:10:38 it allowed so what are some magical moments to me the first magical moment in telling the story was looking at
01:10:48 Albert Einstein in his struggle because although we regard him as a genius as I said in 1911 he actually made an
01:10:54 incorrect prediction about spending starlight and that's actually what set the astronomers off in 1914 there was an
01:11:06 eclipse and by various accidents of war and weather and all sorts of things that we talked about in the book no one was
01:11:13 able to make the measurement if they had made the measurement it would have disagreed with his 1911 prediction
01:11:23 because nature only has one answer and so you then you see how fortunate he was that Wars and bad weather and accidents
01:11:34 and transporting equipment stopped any measurements from being made so he corrects himself in 1915 and but the
01:11:40 astronomers are already out there trying to make the measurement so now he gives them a different number and it turns out
01:11:45 that's the number that nature agrees with so it gives you a sense of this is a person struggling with something
01:11:55 deeply and it although his deep insight led him to this it is the circumstance of time place an accident but through
01:12:04 which we view him and it could the story could have turned out very differently where first he makes the prediction the
01:12:12 measurements are made in 1914 they disagree with his prediction and so what would the world view him as well he's
01:12:17 this professor who made this prediction that didn't get it right yes so the fragility of human history is
01:12:28 illustrated by that story and this is one of my favorite things you also learn things like in our book how eclipses and
01:12:36 watching eclipses was a driver of the development of science in our nation when it was very young in fact even
01:12:42 before we were a nation turns out they were citizens or citizens of this would be country they were going out trying to
01:12:52 measure eclipses so some fortunes some misfortune affects the progress of science especially with ideas as to me
01:13:03 at least if I put myself back in those days as radicals general relativity is first can you describe if it's okay
01:13:14 briefly what general relativity is and yeah if you could you just take a moment if ya put yourself in those shoes in the
01:13:22 eka and academic researchers scientists of that time and what is this theory what is it trying to describe about our
01:13:32 world it's trying to answer the thing that left Isaac Newton puzzled Isaac Newton says gravity magically goes from
01:13:42 one place to another he doesn't believe it by the way he knows that's not right but the mathematics is so good that you
01:13:49 have to say well I'll throw my qualms away because I'll use it that's all we use to get for a man from the earth to
01:14:01 the moon was that mathematics so I'm one of those scientists and I've seen this and if I thought deeply about it maybe I
01:14:06 know that Newton himself wasn't comfortable and so the first thing I would hope that I would feel is gee this
01:14:13 is young kid out there who has an idea to fill in this hole that was lay left with us by Sir Isaac Newton that would I
01:14:23 hope would be my reaction I have a suspicion I'm I'm kind of a mathematical creature I was four years old when I
01:14:31 first decided that size was what I wanted to do my and so if my personality back then was
01:14:39 like it is now I think it's probably likely I would want to want to have studied his mathematics what was a piece
01:14:46 of mathematics that he was using to make this prediction because he didn't actually create that mathematics that
01:14:52 math.max was created of roughly fifty years before he lived he's the person who harnessed it in order to make a
01:14:58 prediction in fact he had to be taught this mathematics by a friend so this is in our book so putting myself in that
01:15:08 time I would want to like I said I think I would feel excitement I would want to know what the mathematics is and then I
01:15:12 wouldn't want to do the calculations myself because one thing that physics is all about is that you don't take
01:15:19 anybody's word for anything it's you can do it yourself it does seem that mathematics is a little bit more
01:15:24 tolerant of radical ideas or mathematicians some people who find beauty in mathematics why all the white
01:15:33 questions have no good answer let me ask why do you think Einstein never got the Nobel Prize for general relativity he
01:15:40 got it for the photoelectric effect that is correct well there first of all that's something that is misunderstood
01:15:46 about the Nobel Prize in Physics the Nobel Prize in Physics is never given for purely giving for purely proposing
01:15:56 an idea it is always given for proposing an idea that has observational support so he could not get the Nobel Prize for
01:16:04 either special relativity nor gen relativity because the provisions that Alfred Nobel left for the award prevent
01:16:13 that but after it's been validated cannot get it then or no yes but remember the validation doesn't really
01:16:22 come until the 1920s but that's why they invented the second Nobel Prize I mean very Curie you can get in second Nobel
01:16:30 Prize for one of the greatest so so linear ease in physics so let me let's be clear on this the theory of general
01:16:40 relativity had its critics even up until the 50s so if you had if had if the committee had wanted to give
01:16:50 the prize for general relativity there were vociferous critics of general relativity up until the 50s Einstein
01:17:01 died in 1955 what lessons do you draw from from the storytelling the book from general activity from the radical nature
01:17:10 of the theory to looking at the future string theory well I think that the string theorists are probably going to
01:17:18 retrace this path but it's gonna be far longer and more torturous in my opinion string theory is such a broad and deep
01:17:33 development that in my opinion when it becomes acceptable it's going to be because of a confluence of observation
01:17:39 it's not gonna be a single observation and I have to tell you that so I give a seminar here yesterday to my team and
01:17:50 it's it's on an idea I have about how string theory can leave signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background which is
01:17:57 a Astro physical structure and so if those kinds of observations are borne out if perhaps other things related to
01:18:05 the idea of supersymmetry borne out those are going to be the first powerful observational II based pieces of
01:18:15 evidence that will begin to do what the Eddington expedition did in 1919 but who that may take several decades do you
01:18:25 think there will be Nobel Prizes given for string theory no because because I think the arrays it'll be you'll be I
01:18:32 think it will exceed normal human lifetimes but there are other prizes that are given I mean there is something
01:18:42 called the breakthrough prize there's a Russian emigre a Russian American immigrant named Yuri Milner I believe is
01:18:50 they started this wonderful prize called the breakthrough prize it's three times as much money since
01:18:56 Novell fries and he gets awarded every year and so something like one of those prizes is likely to be garnered at some
01:19:07 point far earlier than a Nobel award jumping around a few topics while you were at Cal Tech you've gotten to interact
01:19:15 I believe with Richard Fineman I have to ask yes do you have any stories to stand on your memory of that I have a fair
01:19:23 number of stories but I'm not prepared to tell them they're not all politically correct copy but well let me just say
01:19:32 I'll say the following Richard Fineman if you've ever read some of the books about him in particular there's a book
01:19:38 called surely you're joking mr. Feinman there's a series of books that starts with surely you're joking mr. fireman
01:19:44 and I think the segment may be something like what do you care what they say or something I mean their titles are all in
01:19:50 there three of them when I read those books I was amazed at how accurately those books betray the man that I
01:19:58 interacted with he was irreverent he was fun he was deeply intelligent he was deeply human and those books tell that
01:20:07 story very effectively even just those moments how did they affect you as a physicist well one of the well it's funny because
01:20:19 one of the things that I didn't hear firemen say this but one of the things that is reputed we've reported that he
01:20:27 said is if you're on a barstool as a physicist and you can't explain to the guy on the barstool next to you what
01:20:33 you're doing you don't understand what you're doing and there's a lot of that that I think
01:20:44 is correct that that when you truly understand something as complicated as string theory when it's in its fully
01:20:55 formed final development it should be something you could tell to the person on the barstool next to you and I that's
01:21:02 something that affects the way I do science quite frankly it also affects the way I talked to the public about
01:21:09 science I it's one of them sort of my mantras that I keep deeply in tried to keep deeply before me when I appear in
01:21:18 public fora speaking about physics in particular in science in general it's also something that Einstein said in a
01:21:25 different way he he said he had these two different formulations one of them is when the answer simple is God
01:21:33 speaking and the other thing that he said was that what he did what he did in his work was simply the distillation of
01:21:42 common sense that you distill down to something and he also said you make things as simple as possible but no
01:21:49 simpler so all of those things and certainly this attitude for me first sort of seeing this was exemplified by
01:21:55 being around Richard Fineman so in all your work you're always kind of searching for the simplicity for all the
01:22:02 early ultimately I am you served on President Barack Obama's Council of Advisors in science and technology for
01:22:09 seven years yes for seven years with Eric Schmidt and several other billion people met Eric for the first time in
01:22:18 nineteen in 2009 when the council was called together yeah seen pictures of you in that room I
01:22:22 mean there's a bunch of brilliant people it kind of looks amazing what was that experience like being called upon that
01:22:30 kind of service so let me go back to my father first of all i earlier mentioned that my father served 27 years in the US Army
01:22:38 starting in World War two he went off in 1942-43 to fight against the fascist he was part of the supply corps that
01:22:47 supplied General Patton as the tanks rolled across Western Europe pushing back the forces of Nazism to meet up
01:22:55 with our Russian comrades who were pushing the Russian you know pushing the Nazis starting in Stalingrad and you
01:23:02 know this you know think of a war is actually a very interesting upset a piece of history too and know from both
01:23:09 sides and here in America we typically don't but I've actually study history as an adult so I she know sort of the whole
01:23:15 story and on the Russian side we don't know the Americans we weren't taught the I know I know
01:23:22 I have many many Russian friends and we've had this conversation in the occasional but you know like general
01:23:27 Zhukov for example was something that you would know but you might not know about a patent but you're right so do
01:23:34 you or gives you cough or raucous offski I mean there's a whole list of names that I've learned in the last 15 or 20
01:23:40 years looking at the Second World War so if father was in the midst of that probably one of the greatest warrior
01:23:49 wars in the history of our species and so the idea of service comes to me essentially from that example so in 2009
01:24:05 when I first got a call from from a Nobel laureate actually in my biology Harold Varmus the only way to India and
01:24:14 I got this email message and he said it needed to talk to me and I said okay fine we can talk got my castes I didn't
01:24:20 hear from him we went through several cycles of this something invested I want to talk to you and then never contacted
01:24:27 and finally I was on my way to give a physics presentation the University of Florida in Gainesville and just just
01:24:35 that stepped off a plane and my mobile phone off and it was Harold and so I said Harold why do you keep sending me
01:24:41 messages that you want to talk but you never call and he said well I'm sorry things have been hectic and that a data
01:24:50 and then he said if you were offered the opportunity to serve on the US President's Council of Advisors on
01:24:57 science and technology what would be your answer I was amused that the formulation of the question yeah yeah
01:25:04 because it's clear that there's a purpose of why the question is asked that way but then he made it clear to me
01:25:14 he wasn't joking and literally my one of the few times in my life my knees went weak and I had to hold myself up against
01:25:27 doubt if most of us who have been the beneficiaries of the benefits of this country when given that kind of opportunity
01:25:35 could say no and I know I certainly couldn't say no I was frightened out of my wits
01:25:45 because I had never although I have my my career in terms of policy recommendations is actually quite long
01:25:53 goes back to the 80s but I have never been called upon to serve as an advisor to a President of the United States and
01:26:09 it was very scary but I did not feel that I could say no because I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself at nights
01:26:16 saying you know that I chickened out or whatever and so I took the plunge and we had a pretty good run there are things
01:26:28 that I did in those seven years that of which I'm extraordinarily proud one of the ways I tell people is if you've ever
01:26:34 seen that television cartoon called Schoolhouse Rock is this one story about how a bill becomes a law and I've kind
01:26:41 of lived that there are things that I did that have now been codified in US law not everybody gets a chance to do
01:26:50 things like that in life what do you think is the you know Science and Technology especially in American
01:26:56 politics you know we haven't had a president who's an engineer or a scientist what do you think is the role
01:27:04 of a president like President Obama in understanding the latest ideas in science and time what was that
01:27:10 experience like well first of all I've met other presidents beside President Obama he is the most extraordinary
01:27:18 president I've ever encountered despite the fact that he went to Harvard when I think about President Obama I I he is a
01:27:27 deep mystery to me in the same way perhaps that these new verses of mystery I don't really understand how that
01:27:33 constellation of personalities could personality traits could come to fit within a per single individual but I saw
01:27:41 them for seven years so I'm convinced that I wasn't seeing fake news seeing real data he was just an
01:27:48 extraordinary man and one of the things that was completely clear was that he was not afraid and not intimidated to be
01:28:01 in a room of really smart people I mean really smart people that he was completely comfortable in asking some of
01:28:11 the world's greatest experts what do I do about this problem and it wasn't that he was going to just take their answer
01:28:18 but he would listen to the advice and that to me was extraordinary as I said I've been around other executives and
01:28:26 I've never seen qua one quite like him he's an extraordinary learner that's what I observed and not just about
01:28:33 science but he has a way of internalizing information in real time that I've never seen in a politician
01:28:40 before even in extraordinarily complicated situations even scientific ideas scientific or non-scientific
01:28:46 complicated ideas don't have to be scientific ideas but I have like I said I've seen him in real time process
01:28:52 complicated ideas with a speed that was stunning in fact he's shocked the entire council I mean we were all stunned at his
01:29:03 capacity to be presented with complicated ideas and then to wrestle with him and internalize them and then
01:29:11 come back more interestingly enough come back with really good questions to ask I've noticed this is in an area that I
01:29:18 understand more of artificial intelligence I've seen him integrate information about artificial intelligence and then
01:29:25 come out with these kind of richard fineman like insights that's exactly right and that's that as I said those of
01:29:32 us who have been in that position it is stunning to see it happen because you don't expect it yeah it takes what
01:29:40 for a lot of sort of graduate students takes like four years in a particular topic he just does it in a few minutes I
01:29:46 have like learn naturally you've mentioned that you would love to see experimental validation of superstring
01:29:54 theory before you before I'll double off this mortal coil which the poacher that reference made me
01:30:01 smile oh well si you know people who actually misunderstand that because it's not what it doesn't mean what we
01:30:06 generally take it to mean colloquially but it's such a beautiful expression yeah it is it's from the hamlet to be or
01:30:14 not to be a speech which I still don't understand what that's above interpretation anyway the what are the
01:30:22 most exciting problems in physics they're just within our reach of understanding and maybe solve the next
01:30:28 two decades they you may be able to see so in physics you limited it to physics physics mathematics this kind of space
01:30:39 of problems that fascinate you well the one that looks on the immediate horizon like we're gonna get to is quantum
01:30:46 computing and that's gonna if we actually get there that's gonna be extraordinarily interesting do you think
01:30:54 that's a fundamentally problem of theory or is it now in the space of engineering it's in the space of engineering I was
01:31:01 not a cue station as you may know Microsoft has this research facility in Santa Barbara I was out there a couple
01:31:10 of months in my capacity as a vice president of American Physical Society and I got a you know I had some things
01:31:16 that were like lectures and they were telling me what they were doing and it sure sounded like they knew what they
01:31:21 were doing and the thing were close to major breakthroughs yeah that's a really exciting possibility there but the back
01:31:31 to Hamlet do you ponder mortality your own mortality nope my mother died when I was 11 years old and so I immediately
01:31:41 knew what the end of the story was for all of us as a consequence I've never never spent a lot of time thinking about
01:31:49 death it'll come in its own good time and sort of to me the job of every human is to make the best and the most of the
01:31:59 time that's given to us in order not for our own selfish gain but to try to make this place a better place for someone else
01:32:13 and on the Y of life why do you think we are I have no idea and I never even worried about it for me
01:32:21 I haven't answered a local answer the apparent why for me was because I'm supposed to do physics but it's funny
01:32:30 because there's so many other quantum mechanically speaking possibilities in your life
01:32:35 such as being an astronaut for example so you know what that I see well like like Einstein and the vicissitudes that
01:32:49 prevented the 1914 measurement in the starlight finding the universe is constructed in such a way that I didn't
01:32:56 become an astronaut which would have for me I would have faced the worst choice in my life whether whether I would try
01:33:04 to become an astronaut or whether I would try to do theoretical physics both of these dreams were born when I
01:33:11 was four years old simultaneously and so I can't imagine how difficult that decision would have been the universe
01:33:20 helped you out on that one not only in that one but in mini ones and it helped me out by allowing me to pick the right
01:33:26 bad is there a day in your life you could relive because it made you truly happy what day would that be if you
01:33:34 could just look that being a theoretical physicist is like having Christmas every day I have lots of joy in my life the
01:33:45 the moments of invention the moments of ideas revelation yes the only thing I exceed them are some family experiences
01:33:53 like when my kids were born and that kind of stuff but they're pretty high up there well I don't see a better way to
01:34:01 end it Jim thank you so much as a huge honor talking today this worked out better than I thought
