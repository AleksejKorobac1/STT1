00:01:14 let's go straight to the conversation do you ponder your mortality are you afraid of death
00:01:59 i i do think about it sometimes i mean it does pop into my head sometimes just the fact that  i mean i'm 53
00:02:08 so if everything goes great i have less than 50 years left you know if everything goes great like
00:02:15 no car accidents no injuries but it could happen today this could be your last day it could be
00:02:21 that's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death there's a there's a bunch of
00:02:25 philosophers ernest becker and  sheldon solomon they believe that death is the at the core of everything wrote
00:02:33 this book warm at the core so does that come into play in the way you see the world
00:02:40 i think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial and understanding that your time is
00:02:44 limited can aid you greatly i think knowing that this is a temporary time that we
00:02:51 we have finite life spans i i think there's a there's great power in that because it
00:02:58 it motivates you it gets you going i think being an immortal living forever would be one of the most depressing
00:03:03 things particularly if everybody else was dying around you and i think one of the things that makes
00:03:08 life so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn't last
00:03:14 you know that you you really get a brief amount of time here and really by the time you're just
00:03:19 starting to kind of figure yourself out who you are and how not to screw things up so bad it's
00:03:23 like time's up the ride's over what about from your like from your daughter's perspective
00:03:30 do you do you  think about the world where and now and what kind of world you're going to leave them
00:03:38 i do you worry about it i do yeah i do i do when i see these  protests and so much  anger in the world today and
00:03:50 then particularly today i think because of the the pandemic and the fact that so many folks are out of work and
00:03:57 through no fault of their own and can't make ends meet and just people feel so helpless and angry
00:04:06 it's  a particularly divisive time it's a particularly turmoil filled time and  it just doesn't seem like the
00:04:14 world of a year ago even just feels very chaotic and dangerous and this
00:04:20 and it's a small thing like in terms of the like the possibilities of things that could happen to the world like a pandemic
00:04:25 like the one we've experienced it really just doubles the amount of deaths on a bad flu year so it relatively speaking
00:04:34 is a small thing comparison to super volcano eruptions asteroid impact a real horrific pandemic or one that you know
00:04:44 really wipes out millions and millions of people it's it's stunning how fragile
00:04:52 civility is it's stunning how fragile our our society really is that something like this can come along some
00:04:58 unprecedented thing unprecedented thing can come along and all of a sudden everybody's out of work
00:05:02 for six months and then everybody's at each other's throats and then politically everyone's
00:05:06 at each other's throats and and then with the advent of social media and 
00:05:12 the images that you can see you know with the videos of police abuse and just racial tensions
00:05:18 are an all-time high to a point where like if you asked me just five or six years ago
00:05:26 like are have racial problems in this country largely been alleviated i'd probably say yeah it's way better than
00:05:31 it's ever been before but now you could argue that it's not now you could argue it's no it's way worse
00:05:36 in just a small amount of time it's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime you cut well while i'm aware
00:05:42 of it you know obviously when i was a young boy in the 60s they were still going through the civil rights movement
00:05:49 but now  it just seems very fever-pitched and i think a lot of that is because of the pandemic and is
00:05:55 because of all the the heightened  just tension the one i liken it to is
00:06:04 road rage because you know people have road rage not just because they're in the car no
00:06:08 one can get to them but also because you're at a heightened state because you're driving fast and you know
00:06:13 you're driving fast you know you have to make split-second movements and so anybody doing something
00:06:19 like what people go crazy because they're they're already at an eight because they're in the car and they're
00:06:23 moving very quickly that's what it feels like with today with the pandemic feels like everybody
00:06:28 is already at an eight so anything that comes along it's like light it all on fire
00:06:34 you know burn it down like that's part of what i think is part of the reason for a lot of the
00:06:39 looting and the riots and all the chaos it's not just the people out of work but it's also that everyone feels so
00:06:47 tense already and everyone feels so helpless and it's like you know doing something like that
00:06:55 makes people  it just it gives people a a whole new motivation for chaos a whole new motivation
00:07:05 for for doing destructive things that i've never experienced in my life and your better days when you see a
00:07:10 positive future what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020 like if you visualize at 2025
00:07:19 that's a better world than today what is that how do we get there what does that look like
00:07:29 i do i i can honestly say i don't know and  i wouldn't have said i don't know a year ago
00:07:33 a year ago i would have said we're going to be okay as much people hate trump the upon economy is doing great i think we're
00:07:40 going to be fine that's not how i feel today today i don't think there's a a clear solution politically
00:07:47 because i think if trump wins people are going to be furious and i think if biden wins people are going to be furious
00:07:53 and particularly like if things get more woke you know if people  continue to enforce
00:08:01 this  forced compliance and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way which seems to be a part of what
00:08:07 this whole woke thing is that is the most disturbing for me is that i see what's going on i see there's a lot of
00:08:15 losers that have hopped on this and they they shove it in people's faces and it doesn't have to make sense like
00:08:20 there was a black lives matter protest that stopped this woman at a restaurant they were surrounding
00:08:25 her outside a restaurant they were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance this is a woman who's
00:08:31 marched for black lives multiple times black lives matter multiple times and the people around her doing this were
00:08:35 all white yeah it's all it's all weird my friend coach t he's a wrestling coach
00:08:41 also  on a podcast my friend brian moses his take on it is that black and he's a black guy he says black lives matter's a
00:08:47 white cult and i'm like when you see that picture it's hard to argue that he's got a point
00:08:54 it's clearly not all about that but there's a lot of people that have jumped on board
00:09:00 that are very much like cult members because the thing about black lives matter or any movement
00:09:07 is you can't control who joins there's no entrance  examination so you don't go okay how do you feel about this what's
00:09:13 your perceptions on that like how you like the the man who shot the trump supporter
00:09:19 in portland you know that guy who murdered the trump supporter then the cop shot him
00:09:24 that guy was walking around with his hand on his gun looking for trump supporters just want i mean he's a
00:09:32 known violent guy who was walking around looking for trump supporters found one and shot one
00:09:36 that has nothing to do with black lives matter he's a white guy he shot another white guy it's just
00:09:41 it's just madness you know and then that kind of madness is  it's disturbing to see it
00:09:48 ramp up so quickly i mean there's been there's been riots in portland every night oh excuse
00:09:52 me demonstrations for 101 days now 101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire
00:09:59 breaking into federal buildings it's like whoever saw that coming nobody saw that coming so
00:10:07 i don't know what the solution is and i don't know what it looks like in five years so 2025 to answer your question like
00:10:13 it could be anything i mean we could be looking at mad max we could be looking at the apocalypse we could we could also be
00:10:18 looking at an invasion from another country we could be looking at a war like a real
00:10:25 hot war to put a little bit of responsibility on you like for me i've listened to you since
00:10:31 the red band olive garden days that's the very beginning and  there was something in the way you communicate
00:10:37 about the world maybe there was others but you're the one i was aware of is you're open-minded and 
00:10:44 like loving towards the world especially as the podcast developed like you just demonstrated and lived this
00:10:51 kind of just kindness or maybe even like lack of jealousy in your own little profession
00:10:55 of comedy it was clear that you didn't you didn't succumb to the weaker aspects of human nature
00:11:04 and thereby inspire like people like me who i was i was naturally probably especially in like the 20s
00:11:11 early 20s kind of jealous on the success of others and you're really the primary person
00:11:15 that taught me to truly celebrate the success of others and so by way of question
00:11:25 you kind of have a role in this of making a better 2025 you have such a big megaphone is there something
00:11:31 you think you can do on this podcast with the words the way you talk the the things you discuss
00:11:39 that could create a better 2025 i think if anything i could help in leading by example
00:11:47 but you know that's only going to help the people that are listening i don't know what else i can do in terms
00:11:54 of like make the world a better place other than express my hopes and wishes for that
00:12:01 and just try to be as nice as i can to people as often as i can but i also think that i've fallen into
00:12:07 this weird category particularly with the spotify deal where you know i'm one of them now
00:12:15 i'm not a regular person anymore now i'm like some famous rich guy so you go from being a
00:12:21 regular person to a famous rich guy that's out of touch you know and  that that's a real
00:12:27 issue whenever you're talking about the economy about just real life problems it's it's interesting it kind of hurts my heart to
00:12:34 hear people say about elon musk he's just a billionaire yeah it's an interesting statement but i
00:12:40 think if you just continue being you and he continue being him people people i think people are just voicing
00:12:47 their worry that you become some rich guy i don't even know if they're doing that
00:12:53 i think they're just finding the way he describes it an attack vector right yeah and i think he's right i
00:13:00 think they just  they can dismiss you by just saying oh you're you're just a that you know you're a you know you're easily 
00:13:09 definable right but there i mean there's truth to that you if you're not careful you can become
00:13:13 out of touch but you that that's an interesting thing like how
00:13:19 why haven't you become out of touch like as a human off the podcast you you don't act like 
00:13:26 like you you talk to somebody like me you don't talk like a famous person or you you don't you don't act rich
00:13:33 like you're better than others there's a certain listen i've talked to quite a few you have too but i've talked to
00:13:40 especially kind of group of people that like nobel prize winners let's say they have sometimes have an error to them
00:13:48 of arrogance yeah and you don't what's that about well you got to know what that is right
00:13:52 like that air of arrogance comes from drinking your own kool-aid you you start
00:13:59 believing that somehow another just because you're getting praise from all these people
00:14:02 that you really are something different usually it exemplifies there's there's something there there's
00:14:10 where there's a lack of struggle you know and i think  struggle is probably one of the most important
00:14:23 balancing tools that a person can have and for me i struggle mentally and i struggle physically i
00:14:30 struggle mentally in that i like we were talking about on the podcast we did previously
00:14:35 you and i on my podcast said i'm not a fan of my work i'm not a fan of what i do i'm my
00:14:40 harshest critic so anytime anybody says something bad about me i'm like
00:14:47 listen i said way worse about myself i you know i don't like anything i do i'm ruthlessly introspective and i will
00:14:55 continue to be that way because that's the only way you could be good as a comedian there's no other way you can't
00:14:59 just think you're awesome and just go out there you have to you have to be like picking apart
00:15:03 everything you do but there's a balance to that too because you have to have enough confidence to go out there and perform
00:15:08 you can't think oh my god i suck i know what i'm doing but i know what i'm doing because i put in all that work and one
00:15:13 of the reasons why i put in all that work is i don't like the i don't like the end result most of
00:15:18 the time so i need to work at it all the time and then there's physical struggle which i think balances everything out
00:15:26 without physical struggle i i've i always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery where if you
00:15:34 have extra charge it's like it leaks out of the top and it becomes unmanageable and messy and
00:15:39 that's how my psyche is if i if i have too much energy if i'm not if i'm not exerting myself in a
00:15:48 violent way like an explosive way like wearing myself out i just don't like the way the world is i
00:15:54 don't like the way i interface with the world i'm too tense i'm i'm i'm i'm too quick to
00:16:01 be upset about things up to but when i work out hard and you know i put in a brutal training session
00:16:08 everything's fine well the first time i talked to you on jerry  you were doing up to um
00:16:16 so sober october and there's something in your eyes  like i think you've talked about that
00:16:22 you you know you exercise the demons out essentially so you exercise to get whatever the parts of
00:16:27 you that you don't like out  there is a dark there's a darkness in you there like the
00:16:33 the competitiveness and the focus of that person that was a scary time in a lot of ways
00:16:37 that sober october thing because  my friends were all talking right because we're
00:16:43 competing against each other and these fitness challenges and you had  one point poor
00:16:50 like you got a certain amount of points for each minute that you went at 80 percent of your max heart rate and one day i got
00:16:57 1100 points so i did seven hours on an elliptical machine watching the bathhouse scene from john
00:17:04 wick where he murders all those people i watched him probably 50 times in a row i went crazy
00:17:10 i went crazy but i went crazy in a weird way where it brought me back to my my fighting days
00:17:17 it was like the same that person came out again it's like well i didn't even know he was in there
00:17:23 it's like they're like like like an assassin like a killer like i felt
00:17:30 i felt like i felt like a like a different person is it echoes of like what mike tyson talked about
00:17:34 essentially like the but no orgasm in their oceans all the crazy that he was is there
00:17:42 is there that is there a violent person in there oh yeah yeah there's a lot of
00:17:47 there's a lot of violence in me for sure i don't know if it's genetic or learned or it's because during my formative years
00:17:53 from the time i was 15 until i was 22 all i did was fight that was all i did that was all i did
00:17:59 all i did was train and compete that's all i did that was my whole life is it connected to 
00:18:07 so you  your mom and dad broke up early on is it connected to the dad at all i i'm sure it's connected
00:18:12 to him also because he was violent and it made me feel very scared to be around him
00:18:19 but i also think it's connected in who he was as a human is transferred into my dna
00:18:24 you know i think there's a certain amount of i mean i mean to be prejudiced against myself i
00:18:32 look like a violent person you know if i didn't know me i'm just even the way i'm built and not even just
00:18:37 the working out bar just the size of my hands and like there's the width of my shoulders
00:18:42 like there's most likely a lot of violence in my history in my past and my ancestry
00:18:51 and i think i think we minimized that with people like so much of your behavior like
00:18:56 when i see my daughter i have a one daughter that's obsessive in terms of like she wants to get really
00:19:01 good at things like could she and she'll practice things all day long and and it's 100 my personality
00:19:09 like she's me in a female form but without the anger as much and without the fear like she's you know loving
00:19:17 household and everything like that but she has this intense obsession with doing things and doing things really
00:19:23 well and getting better what's the point we have to tell her to stop like stop doing handsprings in the house stop
00:19:29 stop come on just sit down have dinner like one more one more like she's just like she's like she's
00:19:34 psycho yeah and i think there's a lot of behavior and personality and
00:19:44 a lot of these things are passed down through genetics we don't really know right we don't know how much of who you are
00:19:53 genetically is learned behavior you know nature and nurture we don't know if it's learned behavior
00:19:58 or whether or not it's something that's intrinsically a part of you because of you know who your parents were
00:20:04 i think there's there's certainly some genetic violence in me there's something you channeled it yeah
00:20:10 you figured out is basically your life it's a productive exploration of how to channel that yes
00:20:16 try how to figure out how to get get that monkey to sit down and calm down there's another
00:20:22 person in there like this is a calm rational kind friendly person who just wants to laugh
00:20:29 and have fun and then there's that dude who comes out when i did sober october that guy's scary i don't like that guy
00:20:35 yeah a guy just wants to get up in the morning and go you know it's like it's i mean when i was competing it
00:20:42 was necessary but it makes me remember i didn't really remember what a
00:20:48 what i used to be like until that it's like when i'm working out seven hours a day yeah and just
00:20:54 so obsessed and and all i was thinking about was winning that's all i was thinking about like if
00:20:58 they were if they were working out five hours a day i wanted i wanted them to know that i was going
00:21:03 to work out an extra three hours and i was going to get up early and i was going to text them all hey
00:21:08 i'm up already taking pictures send selfies you know i was like you're going to die i kept telling them
00:21:13 you're all going to die and try to keep up with me you're going to die you weren't fully joking no i wasn't
00:21:17 joking at all that's what i was up about it was the scary thing when i interacted with goggins
00:21:24 and what i saw in you on during that time is like this guy like like this is why i've been avoiding
00:21:31 dave ganga's recently is like because he wants to meet he has to do like talk on this podcast but he
00:21:38 also wants to run an ultra marathon with me and i felt like this is a person
00:21:44 if i spend any time in this realm if i spend any time with the joe rogan of that sober october like i might have to die
00:21:50 to get out like there's this kind of  yeah there's a competitive aspect that's
00:21:55 super unhealthy i mean you saw the video that we watched earlier today of goggins draining his knee
00:22:01 that would stop me from running ever again because i would think in my head okay i'm gonna ruin my cartilage i'm gonna
00:22:06 need a knee replacement i would start thinking i would go down that line but he is perpetually in this push-it mindset you know what he talk
00:22:16 calls the dog in him you know he's got that dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog
00:22:22 you know and that's that's who he is that's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational and he's fuel
00:22:27 for millions and millions of people i mean he really is he motivates people in a way that is
00:22:34 so powerful but it can be very destructive i just i know i know now especially after the sober october thing
00:22:41 that that thing's still in me you know i didn't know because i really haven't done anything physically competitive
00:22:46 except one time i was supposed to fight wesley snipes it came out then too that came out too that got creepy too
00:22:53 but luckily that never happened but that was many months of training like training twice a day every day
00:23:00 kickboxing in the morning jiu jitsu at night i was just going going and going and going
00:23:06 and i was just thinking just all day long and it but it with all the other aspects of your life
00:23:11 with your friendships with your your with my comedy with everything because that mindset is not a mindset of an
00:23:20 artist it's a mindset of a conqueror the concur yeah destroyer that's why it's so interesting to see mike tyson
00:23:27 make the switch it's clear that like whatever that is however that fight goes he made us
00:23:31 there's a switch of a dif he stepped into a different dimension roy jones jr is coming on my podcast
00:23:36 soon and  you know roy's gonna be on  before the fight i'm i'm so curious to see how it goes down
00:23:44 but genuinely concerned because mike tyson is a heavyweight and roy jones at his best was 168 pounds
00:23:52 and i don't know if roy has that room in his house mental house of where mike tyson goes i
00:23:56 don't know i don't know if he has a rope mike doesn't have a room he's he's got an
00:24:01 empire in there with the open side the door there's a whole empire in his head and
00:24:07 he's he's in that firmly you know when he got out of the weed and and
00:24:12 started training again like you could see it in him and by the way physically in person he looks spectacular he looks
00:24:20 like a adonis i mean he looks ready to go yeah it's crazy yeah i watch the videos of him
00:24:26 what about you  have you ever considered competing in jiu jitsu no for that very reason i don't want to
00:24:31 get obsessed that's my my number one concern i had to quit video games
00:24:36 yeah when we were playing video games at the studio i had to quit because i was playing five hours a day like out of
00:24:41 nowhere all of a sudden i was playing five hours a day i was coming home late for dinner
00:24:45 i was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games and playing i get obsessed with things and i have to recognize
00:24:52 what that is and these competitive things like competitive especially like really exciting
00:24:57 competitive things like video games they're very dangerous for me the ultimate competitive video game is like
00:25:04 jiu jitsu and if i was young i most certainly would have done it if i didn't have like a very clear career path it was
00:25:09 something that i enjoyed my concern would be that i would become a professional jiu jitsu fighter
00:25:15 when i was young and then i would not have the energy to do stand up and do all the other things
00:25:20 that i wound up doing as a career when i was 21 i quit my job teaching i was teaching at
00:25:27 boston university i was teaching taekwondo there and i i knew and i also had my own school in revere i
00:25:34 knew i couldn't do it right and also be doing stand-up comedy i knew i couldn't do both of those things
00:25:41 there was no way you have to be cognizant of  that obsessive force within you to make
00:25:46 sure  yes i i have to know how to manage my mental illness right that's
00:25:51 that's a very particular mental illness and i think that mental illness again my formative years from 15 until i was
00:26:00 you know 21-ish 22 those those years were spent constantly obsessed with martial arts that was my whole day
00:26:09 i mean i trained almost every day the only time i would not train is if i was either injured or
00:26:15 if i was exhausted if i needed a day off but i was obsessed and so that part of my personality
00:26:22 that i haven't nurtured is always going to be there under the surface and when you it gets reignited by
00:26:27 something it's very weird it's a weird feeling and it can get reignited with a video game
00:26:33 it can get reignited with anything that that obsessive that you know whatever it is that
00:26:38 competitive demon yeah the way you talk about guitar i know you would love fall in love with
00:26:42 playing guitar but i think you're very wise to not touch that thing that's why i want golf
00:26:48 i have friends who want to golf i'm like with that thing so a lot of people ask me about  like what's
00:26:55  joe rogan's jiu jitsu game like like like like assuming that i i somehow spend  hours rolling with you before and after
00:27:04 we interact i mean what's a good  you should at some point show a technique or something that'll be
00:27:08 fun sure i mean i've got what's your game what's your name oh there i saw i saw you doing a i
00:27:15 think had an arm  something online yeah i did that was i my neck i'm doing head and arm chokes i did them so much
00:27:22 that i i you know because you use your neck so much with head and arms chokes i developed like a real kink in my neck
00:27:29 and  it turned out i had a bulging disc and  you know so you do it on that just one side
00:27:35 well it was  no i could do it on the left side but i definitely am better on the right side
00:27:39 the right side was my best side so if you were to compete let's say like what's your a game
00:27:45 what would you go from standing up how would you go to submission would you pull guard would you take down
00:27:51 what how would you pass guard what's i don't have good takedowns i mean i was not a good wrestler
00:27:57 so i would most likely either pull guard or i would pull half guard do you have a good guard yes are you comfortable being
00:28:02 on your butt on your back yes i'm very i'm very flexible so i have good
00:28:07 my rubber guard is pretty you go to right yeah i have good arm bars and good triangles off my back but
00:28:13 i also have a very good half guard but my top game is my best i have i have a very strong top game you have a
00:28:19 hashtag card you have a preference of like what kind of guard and how to pass that guard and
00:28:27  like yeah like is there a specific game plan like you would you double under hooks from half guard is the game plan
00:28:33 for me if i can get double underhooks from half guard i could sweep a lot of people under hooks of what sorry the arms are
00:28:39 so half guard lock down right half card go into lock down double under hooks got it clinched to
00:28:46 the body suck the body into the type pressure and yeah massive pressure and then inch my way into a position we call the
00:28:52 dog fight and inch my way to a position where i could get the person on their back
00:28:58 yeah that's what because you did show me i still disagree with you about the thai thing that you can choke so wrong so wrong
00:29:06  well it's not wrong with you with you it's wrong because you you know i think there's a system
00:29:11 where i i've have this thing with donna here we're gonna figure it out okay but  let's have a little velcro
00:29:16 in the back let's see that's you're just not cheating you're not you're the exact
00:29:20 that's cheating  yeah you did i did feel when you showed me
00:29:25 i think you showed me the rubber guard because it's still a god that's a little bit foreign to me
00:29:30 i just felt that you can immediately feel not with the rubber guard just but the way you move your body is
00:29:38 you're like a shanji type of guy who knows how to control another human being so like some people are a little bit more
00:29:45 i would say agile and technic like playful and kind of loose loose and they work on
00:29:51 transition transition transition you're a control guy like you know how to control position in an advanced position
00:29:57 donahue is the same way he's all about control my game is smush that's my game smush you grab a hold of
00:30:04 you once i have you why would i let you go that's my thought is like why would i let you go i just want to incrementally
00:30:09 move to a better position until i can strangle you but i'm much more into strangling people than anything
00:30:18 else yeah which is a great mma approach for jiu jitsu well too many people don't
00:30:24 tap when you get their arms you know and i'm it's not i'm not opposed to arm bars i love arm
00:30:29 bars but everybody goes to sleep yep and and quit from pressure too i mean yeah
00:30:36 quit mentally that's nothing like you can't breathe you know if you got a guy who's like a
00:30:40 really good top game guy and he mounts you and i'm a big fan of mounting with my legs crossed
00:30:47 you know like a guard like a top guard and so i can squeeze with both legs smush and i'm just i'm just looking
00:30:55 for people to make mistakes and slowly incrementally bettering my position until i can get something locked up
00:31:01 yeah i love jiu jitsu though man i just wish it didn't injure you yeah you know jiu-jitsu is like if your
00:31:06 joints were more durable they could figure out a way to make joints more durable god i could do jiu
00:31:10 jitsu forever yeah so much fun i actually i talked to this  roboticist russ tedrick he builds
00:31:17 one of the world-class people that builds humanoid robots you're interested in boston dynamics yeah they keep people
00:31:23 in that kind of robotics so i asked him the stupidest question of like how far are we we from  having a robot
00:31:31 be a ufc champion and  yeah it's actually a really really tough problem it's it's it's the same
00:31:38 thing that you know makes somebody like danielle comey like on the wrestling side special because you have to understand
00:31:43 the movement of the human body in ways that so difficult to teach it's so it's so subtle the timing
00:31:49 the pressure points like the leverage all those kinds of things that's just for the clinch
00:31:53 situation and then the movement for the striking is very difficult as long as you're not allowed as a robot
00:32:01 to like use your natural abilities of having a lot more power right a lot more power and
00:32:07 more durable right the human body like especially meniscus like like you see the the heel hook game
00:32:13 like everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks like all those guys wind up with torched
00:32:19 knees everyone's got torched knees everyone's knees are torn apart you and you don't grow new meniscus you
00:32:25 know that's like one of those joints where man when it goes this is and those guys are 28 years old
00:32:32 blown out knees let me ask the ridiculous question what do you think we're talking about cops what do you
00:32:36 think  is the best martial arts for self-defense for sure jiu-jitsu yeah wrestling right i think grappling i should say
00:32:45 with judo as well especially in a cold climate if you get someone who's got like a heavy winter jacket on my god
00:32:50 like judo is an incredible plus concrete that's the worst place to be with a
00:32:56 heavy winter jacket with a judo specialist and you're standing up with them oh my god but i think grappling because
00:33:03 in most self-defense situations it usually winds up with grappling you're definitely better
00:33:08 off though knowing some striking because there's nothing more terrifying than when you go to take someone down
00:33:13 they actually have takedown skills but they can fight and so they have takedown defense
00:33:17 and they know how to fight and then you don't know how to stand up like the worst thing in the world seeing someone
00:33:22 like reaching who doesn't know how to do striking and someone cracks you what about all that
00:33:28 krav maga talk which is like you know the whole line of argument that says that jiu jitsu and wrestling and all
00:33:33 these sports they fundamentally take you away from the nature of violence
00:33:39 so they're just teaching you how to play versus the reality of of violence that is involved in like a
00:33:47 self-defense situation that is is a totally different set of skills would be needed in general the
00:33:54 people that say that jiu-jitsu or other martial arts don't they it's more of a sport and they
00:34:00 don't really understand and they don't really understand violence in general the people that say
00:34:07 that suck yeah that's anybody who thinks like someone's like you know hey man i'll
00:34:11 just bite you i'm like are you gonna bite me okay do you think i'm gonna bite you too what do
00:34:16 you think of that what if i punch you in your face you think you're still gonna bite me
00:34:21 when you can't even see yeah when you you you barely even know you're alive and i
00:34:25 choke you unconscious if someone's really good at jiu jitsu good luck stabbing them with your keys
00:34:31 you know you don't have a chance you don't have a chance if someone's much better you and they trip you and get you
00:34:35 on your back and then they elbow you in your face and get a head and arm choke on you
00:34:41 all that krav maga it's out the window son you're way better off learning what works on train killers
00:34:48 like this whole idea that you're going to poke some of the eye and then you're going to kick him in the nuts and
00:34:52 like you're you're going through these drills that yeah it's good to know what to do if you run into someone who
00:34:57 doesn't know how to fight it's way better to know what to do to someone who knows how to fight
00:35:04 that's the best thing learn how to fight against people who know how to fight like all that practice self-defense and
00:35:11 they're gonna it's gonna come at you with a knife you're gonna grab the wrist and do that
00:35:16 like it's good to know self-defense but it's much more important to understand martial arts
00:35:22 comprehensively when you understand martial arts comprehensively like there's no crop i shouldn't say
00:35:27 there's no krav maga guys but it's it would be shocking if a krav maga guy and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight
00:35:35 and the mixed martial arts guy was a trained killer all around didn't that guy up that's that's
00:35:41 what i would expect would happen i would i would i would not think that some guy who
00:35:47 has a little bit of this and a little bit of that and prepares for the streets is going to be able to handle a person
00:35:53 who trains with killers on a day-to-day basis who rolls with jiu jitsu black belts
00:35:58 who trains with muay thai champions like here it's the best martial arts of the martial arts that work on martial artists
00:36:05 not the martial arts that work on untrained people what about we're in texas now what about guns
00:36:11 that's the best martial art no but would you like  in this crazy time should people carry guns it's not a bad idea to have a gun
00:36:22 because if you need a gun you have a gun and if you don't need a gun if you're a person with self-control
00:36:26 you're not going to use it you're not going to just randomly use it but you have something
00:36:31 to protect you this is the whole idea of the second amendment the whole idea of the second amendment
00:36:35 gets distorted by mass shootings or by terrible people murder people and do terrible things but
00:36:40 it's that's all those things are real but they don't take away from the fundamental efficacy
00:36:48 of having a firearm and defending your family or defending your life and there are real live situations where
00:36:55 people have had firearms and it's protected them or their loved ones or they've stopped
00:37:00 shooters there's there's many of these stories but people don't like those stories because then it
00:37:06 it tends to lead to this gun culture argument is pro-gun culture argument that people find very uncomfortable it's
00:37:12 it's human beings are messy and we're messy in so many different ways right we're messy
00:37:18  emotionally we're messy messy physically but we're also messy in what's good or bad what's we want things to be
00:37:24 binary we want things to be right or wrong you know one or zero and they're not
00:37:31 but but there is crime in the world and there is violence in the world and you're better off knowing how to fight
00:37:36 and you're betting better off knowing how to defend yourself and you're better off having a gun
00:37:41 and yeah i generally think that guns i do like the idea that guns second amendment
00:37:46 helps protect the first amendment there's a kind of sense that makes puts me at ease knowing
00:37:52 that so many people in this country have guns that  i mean alex jones i just listened to one episode of infowars
00:38:01 for the first time boy is he he reminds me like when i drank some tequila i felt like i'm going
00:38:06 to some dark places today that's how i feel like listening to him but 
00:38:12 he talks about like that it's he worries about martial law so basically government overreach by
00:38:17 which happened throughout history like there's there's something to worry about
00:38:23 there but it's it puts me at ease knowing that so much of the population has guns that people government would
00:38:29 think twice before  instituting martial law on cities but i actually was asking almost like on
00:38:36 the individual level i maybe shouldn't say this but i don't yet own a gun
00:38:44 and i felt that if i carry a gun statistically just for me as a human knowing my psychology i feel like i'm
00:38:49 more likely to die like i feel like i would put myself in situations that i shouldn't like the way i i will
00:38:57 see the world will change because my natural feeling is like when somebody when i was in philly
00:39:05 and i knew late at night in west philly when some guy looks at you you can immediately calculate that this is a
00:39:11 dangerous human being there it starts with a monkey look at first like
00:39:17 i'm a bigger monkey than you and that's where i found like for example i'll do the beta thing of just looking down and
00:39:21 turning away and just getting out of trouble like very politely
00:39:28 and basically that kind of approach because if you have a in terms of getting out of serious violence
00:39:33 situations like serious something where you could die versus if i had a gun i feel like i would want to be
00:39:42 that that would be that cowboy monkey thing where i would want to put myself in situations
00:39:47 where i'm a little bit of a savior even of myself and almost create danger which
00:39:54 can no longer like the escalation of which i can no longer control well you're talking about taking a gun somewhere
00:40:01 versus having a gun in your home yes yes i mean carry on me that's a different situation and much harder
00:40:06 to get a warrant for or a license for that you know control concealed carry licenses especially in massachusetts
00:40:12 they don't come easy a little message yeah that's a whole nother thing yeah you're saying gun in the home yeah
00:40:17 a gun in the home having a gun having knowing how to use a gun like i know how to use a gun i've
00:40:24 trained you know many hours learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places you know there's a
00:40:28 bunch of videos of me doing it on  instagram i i practice and i think it's good to to understand
00:40:35 how to be accurate so i've been a fan of your podcast for a long time you don't often talk about it
00:40:41 because you're always kind of looking forward but if you look at the old studio they just left
00:40:48 is there some epic memories that stand out to you that you like you almost look back i
00:40:53 can't believe this happened oh yeah almost too many of them to count is that something that pops into mine
00:41:00 now all of them elon musk blowing that flamethrower in the middle of the hallway i got a video of that
00:41:05 have you seen the video of it yeah yeah i think you posted on instagram i think i did too
00:41:10 yeah he's a madman having bernie sanders in there  you know just  all the fun fight
00:41:16 companions we did and all the crazy podcasts with joey diaz and duncan trussell and
00:41:21 there were so many there were so many moments you know it's podcast is this is a weird art form
00:41:30 and it almost seems like it sounds silly but it almost seems like something that chose me rather than i chose it
00:41:36 i think of that all the time in some strange way it's like i'm i'm showing up as like an antenna
00:41:43 and i just plug in and twist twist on and then i i take in the thing and i put it
00:41:47 together and i'm like a passenger of this weird ride yeah you you've talked about this before i really
00:41:55 like this idea of that human beings are just carriers of these ideas yeah ideas are the ones who are breeding
00:42:01 yeah in a sense like the idea found you as a useful brain to use to spread itself through the podcasting medium
00:42:09 yeah something that that's a on  but did because when i think about your podcast i think about joey diaz i
00:42:15 think about all those comedians you've had i mean i think you've had joey on i mean maybe close to
00:42:24 50 times some crazy number is there i mean he's over the top offensive just that's who he is to the core is there
00:42:36 some sense where you you wondered like whether it's right to have the spotify episode number one with
00:42:49 that's why we wore nasa suits and we got high as it's like that's the whole idea behind
00:42:54 it i mean can you introspect that a little bit like can you think like what is that because that's rare
00:43:00 it's such a rare thing to do because they they're you're not supposed to talk to duncan trussell
00:43:07 with a huge platform that you have five hours why not because donald trump apparently watches
00:43:13 your podcast so so just the idea that there's these i mean that's what i think about
00:43:19 you know these ceos write to me that they listen to the podcast that that i do and i have somebody like a
00:43:26 david fravor and i was nervous about it i was nervous to have a conversation for me
00:43:32 david fravor is a duncan trestle which is like just because of his experiences with the ufos
00:43:38 yeah just even just the way he sees the world because he is open i don't know if he's always like
00:43:42 this but he opened himself to the possibility of unconventional ideas most people in the scientific community kind of
00:43:49 say well i don't really want to believe anything that doesn't have a lot of hard evidence right and so that was to me like a step
00:43:57 and as the thing somehow becomes more popular that it becomes this fear of like
00:44:04 well should i talk to this person or not and i mean you're an inspiration and saying like do whatever the hell you want
00:44:11 you have to well first of all i have what you call you money and if you have you money you don't say
00:44:17 you what's the point of having the you money you're wasting it like you're wasting
00:44:21 the position like someone said to me like why do you why do you like sports cars so much like how many
00:44:26 cars do you have a bunch of cars so because if i was a kid and i said hey if i was that crazy rich famous guy
00:44:32 like i don't want to have a bunch of cool cars like so i so i would do that like because that not
00:44:39 everybody gets to do that like if you're the person that gets to do that you're kind of supposed to do it like
00:44:44 that's if you if you want to if that really does speak to you and you know um
00:44:49 i've talked to you about this before but muscle cars specifically once from the 1960s and the
00:44:56 early 70s they speak to me in some weird way man i could just stare at them like i have a 65 corvette i walk around
00:45:01 it sometimes at night when no one's around what's your favorite muscle car like what's your
00:45:09 most badass late 60s the probably that car probably that 65 corvette yeah
00:45:15 i walk around it when no one's around i think i've during the 69 corvette is there a particular year
00:45:22 that  just 65 is  generation two 69 is generation three 69 is like the it's even more curvy they're both
00:45:29 awesome just awesome in different ways but i just love muscle cars for whatever reason but but the point is like i like what i
00:45:38 like and if i can do what i want to do i should do what i want to do and it's not hurting anybody and
00:45:43 the thing is like i would do the duncan podcast if no one was listening right right if it was if we were just starting
00:45:48 to do a podcast together and  no one cared and it got like 2 we did for years a long time i would do
00:45:54 it with duncan and we would get high and we'd talk crazy about aliens and spaceships and
00:46:00 maybe dude maybe ideas are living life forms and they're inside your head and that's how things get
00:46:05 man yeah man i've just kind of morphed me and him together in that because the
00:46:11 life form ideal life form idea is mine that i've i've really really think about a lot i think about a
00:46:16 technical side by the way like  i when i heard you say that because i've been thinking i was like
00:46:21 oh whoa that's interesting that it might be they might be alive because they i don't know what the
00:46:26 they are but when someone has an idea for  you know whatever an invention a toaster
00:46:32 and then they think about this all it need is like these heating elements and a spring
00:46:36 and then it pops on the stunts i have a timer and then they build this thing now also it's alive
00:46:42 it's like you manifested it in a physical form a toaster is not the best example but
00:46:48 a car a airplane you're thinking about a thing like an idea comes into your head and you can say oh well it's just
00:46:54 creativity it's a part of being a person that's how we invented tools and how you know we became better
00:46:59 hunters all those things are true it's i'm not saying that there's some magic to what i'm saying
00:47:07 but there's also a possibility that we're simplifying something by saying that it's just creativity
00:47:12 that it's just a natural human inclination to invent things but why is it possible
00:47:21 that ideas like creativity like we are the only animal other than there's a few species that
00:47:25 create things like bees make bee hives and but it's very they're very uniform
00:47:32 you know some animals use tools you know like you know chimps will use like sticks to get
00:47:36 termites and things like that but there's something about what we do that's it makes you wonder because we
00:47:42 look at this just look at this room that we're in look at all these electronics
00:47:48 look at all this crazy that human beings have invented and then built upon others
00:47:54 inventions improved and innovated these all came out of ideas like the the idea they it germinates in someone's head it
00:48:03 bounces around they write it down they share it with others the other people who have similar ideas or ideas
00:48:09 that are complementary they work together and they they change the world and the new thing in that is the idea is not the
00:48:16 people it's like we think we found the ideas but it's more like the ideas the ideas found us fine you yeah they're
00:48:21 literally in the in the air yeah they come to you i always felt like that with bits
00:48:27 like when i come up with a bit that's why i'm i'm always telling people about the stephen pressfield book the war of
00:48:34 art because he talks about  respecting the muse and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down and
00:48:41 you do the work or you sit down like a professional and you you talk to the muse like come tell me
00:48:47 what to do like if the muse was a real thing as if it amuses like a some mystical creature that comes and
00:48:53 delivers you ideas even if that's not real that's how it works yeah
00:48:58 it does work like that if you do treat it like it's a muse and you treat it with the respect and
00:49:03 you you treat it like a professional the ideas do come to you i never thought about what he's doing he's just sitting
00:49:07 there waiting for the idea that's trying to breed to find him
00:49:12 yeah there's that's a that's a trippy thing if you show off trippy if you show up and put in the time and
00:49:18 focus your energy on that the the ideas they will arrive that will arrive and that's the same
00:49:25 with writing comedy like there's been many many times where i'll come home from the comedy store
00:49:30 and i just sit down and start writing and i just i've i got nothing there's nothing there i'm just writing it's all
00:49:37 nothing's good it's just like and then all of a sudden bam there's the idea
00:49:44 melson i can't stop and then you know a couple hours later and i'm like whoa and then the next night i'm on stage and
00:49:49 i'm like how about that boom it gets this big laugh i'm like holy
00:49:54 and i know that came out of the discipline to sit down and call the muse i mean the cool thing is the ideas have
00:50:01 found you to like oh i'm going to use this dude like he seems to have a podcast that's
00:50:07 popular yeah i'm going to breed inside his brain yeah and spread it to others yeah an
00:50:13 or an inventor you know i'm going to use this guy who's like desperately seeking some sort of a
00:50:17 a product to bring to market some guy who wants to invent things he's thinking about inventing things all the time
00:50:23 like these ideas that weasel their way into your head and it seems to me also that your your the frequency that your mind
00:50:33 operates under has to be correct because one of the things about creativity seems to be if you think about yourself a lot
00:50:39 if you're really into yourself or your image or or you're selfish those ideas are not they don't find you yes that's funny
00:50:49 the creative yeah yes it stifles the opportunity that the idea has for defining yes which is one of the reasons why joke
00:50:56 thieves people that steal jokes are terrible writers there's never like really good writers
00:51:00 who are also joke thieves it's just joke thieves and then you know when they have to write on their own if they get exposed
00:51:08 they become terrible comedians they're of a shadow of what they were when they were stealing other people's ideas
00:51:14 because the thing that would make you steal a person's idea is that ego part the the like the
00:51:20 wanting to claim it for yourself to wanting to be the man i'm gonna or the woman you know you want
00:51:24 to be the person who gets out there that says it and everybody's gonna love me for it like
00:51:29 you can't think like that and be creative it requires a humility and it requires a detachment from self in order to create like
00:51:39 when i'm writing i'm blank i'm like i'm just staring i'm like i'm just the part of my mind that's
00:51:44 active is not like me it's like this weird core function part where i'm not i'm not aware of
00:51:54 my personality i'm not aware i'm not aware of anything i'm just trying to put it together in a
00:52:00 way that i know works and just being there being present yeah pressfield is just i'm a big believer
00:52:04 just sitting there you're not staring at a blank page putting in the time
00:52:10 yeah and sometimes it's not that way sometimes it's an inspiration like sometimes i'll be sitting there
00:52:14 at dinner and i'll be like i'll be right i got an idea and my wife is really cool about that i'm like i have an idea and i
00:52:20 i have to just run out of the room real quick and i write it down on my phone and then i can come back
00:52:24 you know because those are those are like little gifts that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere
00:52:31 and some people rely only on those gifts you know and i've talked to comics about it like i can't come on my best ideas
00:52:36 when i don't write i'm like no i do too i come up with great ideas when i don't write but i also write
00:52:41 like you can do both of those things they're not mutually exclusive you mentioned you money i i feel
00:52:49 like i have you money now a year ago i was at zero i have you money now because
00:52:55 probably my standards my i i don't need much in this world but because also probably because of you
00:53:00  but it's 300 to 400 000 people listen to every episode
00:53:06 i do and a lot and that result is weird it's a successful television show on cable yeah it's crazy but it's all you
00:53:13 it's yeah it's hilarious that's amazing but at this point that also resulted in fu money in a
00:53:18 sense that i don't you know i don't need anything else in this world but so
00:53:25 by way of asking i've looked up if you've inspired me for a long time do you have advice you've done this
00:53:34 on the podcast side of life do you have advice for somebody like for me and somebody like me
00:53:41 going on this journey eric weinstein is going on this journey is there advice both
00:53:48 small and big that you have for somebody like me the advice is to keep doing what feels
00:53:53 right to you and do what you're doing obviously it's resonating with people if you're getting
00:53:58 that big of an audience and i've listened to your podcast you're very good at it so
00:54:03 just keep doing it the way you're doing it don't let anybody else get involved what about you've connected
00:54:10 i think you met jamie at the comedy store i met him at the ice house at the ice house well i think i met him at the
00:54:15 comedy store but then  we talked at the ice house i mean what you'd have to ask him yeah did you think deeply about
00:54:23 because like you know you basically have nobody on your team and and so it almost feels like a
00:54:28 marriage where is it were you selective about like a jam to somebody to bring into your little circle
00:54:37 well jamie's exceptional he is he truly he's a special i mean he might have grown i don't
00:54:40 remember how he was in the early days maybe you could say but he's definitely better at it but he
00:54:45 right away he's exceptional he's got very little ego yes he's he's not a guy who needs a lot of
00:54:52 attention he's not a guy who overestimates  anything like in terms of like a
00:55:00 negative or positive like his  like his his interpretation of whether it's  good things that happen
00:55:07 to the show or bad things that happen the show he just takes it all like flat he's chill he's just cool as
00:55:14 and he's so smart and he's so good as an audio engineer and as a podcast producer
00:55:20 he's the best but he's basically one of the only people on you on this whole team so
00:55:25 yeah how do you find i mean when you let people in i mean i'm sure other people wanted to
00:55:30 get involved like why don't you have a co-host like you basically kind of well do you well here's the problem with the co-host
00:55:38 like when you and i are talking when we're talking i'm tuned in to you and i'm waiting
00:55:44 to hear what you're saying and i'm listening and i'm interpreting it and then i'm calculating whether or not
00:55:49 i have anything to say whether to let you keep talking whether i maybe have a question that lets you
00:55:55 expand further or whether i have a disagreement or like there's a dance
00:56:01 that's going on now when there's another person there chiming in too it the dance up it's like dancing
00:56:07 like if you're doing an  a dance with someone you know like if you're slow dancing with someone and then a
00:56:13 third person's there stepping on your feet sometimes it's fun yeah sometimes having a third person is fun
00:56:21 comedy podcast sometimes it's fun kind of structured yeah debate structures but even then it gets
00:56:25 difficult because people talk over each other and also i find that without headphones
00:56:32 it's way easier to talk over each other you make mistakes yeah you don't you don't hear it the same way when you
00:56:38 have headphones you i hear what you hear it's all one sound and i the audience hears exactly or rather i hear exactly what
00:56:46 the audience hears whether it's over here my voice is louder than yours because you're over there
00:56:52 and if i don't have headphones on it doesn't it's not all together on that point one of the interesting
00:56:58 things about your show is  you don't almost never have done and you just generally don't do remote like
00:57:05 sorry not remote calls but you don't go to another person's location like you have only done a few a small
00:57:11 handful and then just like  will the sapolsky he should be yeah he should do this but actually we
00:57:16 went back and forth on email i told him he needs to get your his ass back in in this in the studio  he's working on
00:57:22 a book i was a fan of his a long time ago because i became obsessed with toxoplasmosis
00:57:29 you know and  i  i've reached out to him a long time ago before he  was willing to do it but then
00:57:35 i caught him in downtown l.a he was there for something else and i just greedily snatched up an hour of his time
00:57:41 well he doesn't get i think some of those folks don't get how much magic can happen in this podcast studio like
00:57:48 bigger than anything they've ever done in terms of their work not i'm not talking about reach but in
00:57:53 terms of the discovery of new ideas there's something magical about conversation like that like somebody as brilliant as him
00:58:02 if he gives himself over to the conversation for multiple hours at a time that's another place where you've been
00:58:08 an inspiration where i like you know i'm getting more and more confident of telling people
00:58:15 like an elon musk that like you know a lot of ceos are like well he has 30 minutes on his schedule i'm
00:58:21 like no three hours and then they're like so some say no and
00:58:28 then they come back these people have started coming back to like okay we're starting to get it they start to
00:58:34 get it and you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense that there's some value in long form
00:58:41 they think that nobody wants to listen for 30 for more than 30 minutes they think like i have nothing to say
00:58:47 but the reality is if you just give yourself over to like the three hours just let it go
00:58:54 three hours four hours whatever it is there's so much to discover about what you didn't even
00:58:58 know you think yeah yeah you have to be confident that you could do it
00:59:05 and  in the beginning i just did it because that's what i wanted to do and no one was listening so i've always
00:59:12 been a curious person so i've always i've always been interested in listening to how
00:59:18 people think about things and how and talking to people about their mindset
00:59:24 and just and expanding on my own ideas and just talking and so we would have these podcasts
00:59:29 and they would go on forever and my my friend ari i've i never let him die and never let this die down i've let
00:59:37 him  forget this he was always like you have to edit your podcast i'm telling you right now you're up
00:59:42 i go why he's like because people are not going to listen to it i go they don't have to
00:59:46 yeah i go you listen to part of it he goes he goes just do it just i'm telling you trust me
00:59:50 cut it down to like 45 minutes that's all you need and i'm like no no i don't think you're right i i like
00:59:56 listening to long-form things no one knows that kind of time i go okay i'm going to do it i'm just
01:00:01 going to keep doing it this way so and it it sticks too good no he doesn't listen to his these are like two and a
01:00:07 half hours long now you won but you wouldn't like say i mentioned to you this before
01:00:13 this is gonna happen it's actually made a lot of progress toys i'm gonna talk to putin but you wouldn't travel to
01:00:18 putin if you want to talk to you putin is a dangerous character he's not he's not you're talking to ever seen the
01:00:26 thing with  jerry craft where they stole his super bowl ring yeah yeah that was i think that was a little
01:00:32 bit of a misunderstanding oh really i think it's a little bit he just decided he's going to steal that super
01:00:35 bowl ring kind of i think that was a kind of he thought can i see your ring
01:00:41 he shows him his ring then he puts it on says i can murder somebody with this ring so he and then he walks off with it
01:00:46 it's possibly he did it  as a he's a big believer in displays of power
01:00:52 yeah so like it's possible he did that but on i think he sees himself as like a tool
01:01:00 with which to demonstrate that russia still belongs on the stage of the big players and so he a lot of action is selected
01:01:07 through that lens but in terms of a human being outside of any of the evils that  he
01:01:15 may or may not have done he is a really thoughtful intelligent fun human being like the wit 
01:01:26 and the depth from the jre perspective is really interesting i'm like his manager now selling
01:01:31 the he's a judo trying to get trump he's really good at judo i i have seen him practice judo he's
01:01:36 he's a legit black belt and not only that he loves it not just skill wise but to talk about it to reason about it to
01:01:43 think about it to mma as well so yeah maybe it'd be a good conversation but you
01:01:52 wouldn't travel to him well this holds your principle so that's the core of the advice
01:01:58 or whatever i would rather here's the thing there's not a person that i have to have on the show right
01:02:06 and i'm happy to talk to anybody i'm just as happy to talk to you as i am to talk to trump as i am
01:02:11 probably more happy to talk to you as i am to talk to mike tyson as i am to talk to joey diaz i like talking to people
01:02:19 i enjoy doing podcasts i enjoy talking to a variety of people and i schedule them based on i want to like
01:02:26 i try not to get too many right-wing people in a row or too many progressive people in a row i don't want to get repetitive
01:02:33 i try not get too many fighters in a row i try to balance it out not too many comedians comedians are the one one group where i
01:02:40 can have three four in a row five in a row because that's my tribe you know those are my people it's easy
01:02:45 we could talk about anything it's a weird dance you know the conversations that you're doing on a
01:02:50 podcast are there they're a strange dance and you want to
01:02:56 you know you want to not step on your own feet and you want to make sure that you do it in a way do the podcast in a way
01:03:03 that's entertaining for people and it's it's the conversations are learning how to
01:03:08 talk to me it's a weird skill yeah it's a weird skill that took a long time for me to get good at
01:03:13 and i didn't know it was a skill until i started doing it and then i i just thought you were just talking
01:03:17 like i was just i know how to talk we'll just talk to people and then along the way i realized like oh
01:03:21 and then when you talk to people that are bad at it you realize that it's a skill like particularly one of the things about
01:03:30 my people about comedians is a lot of them tend to want to talk but don't want to listen
01:03:37 right so they're waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk but they're not necessarily thinking about
01:03:42 what you're saying you know and they're just just waiting for their opportunity or they talk over
01:03:47 you or they and i try real hard not to do that sometimes i fail but
01:03:53 my when i'm at my best i'm i'm dancing yeah ultimately the skill conversation is just
01:04:00 really listening mm-hmm like really and listening and thinking listening and thinking and being like
01:04:05 genuinely curious and and really having you know a take on what they're saying and and 
01:04:14 and maybe a follow-up question or maybe you know just got it's got to be real it's got to be authentic
01:04:19 and when it is authentic and it's real it resonates with people like they're listening and they go oh
01:04:24 like i'm locked in with the way you're thinking like you two guys are in a conversation and i'm locked in
01:04:31 you know when she talks and you listen i i'm listening to you know when he says something to her when she says something to
01:04:38 to him like there's a thing that happens during conversations where you're there like you're listening to
01:04:43 and it's with me when i listen to a good podcast i feel like i'm in the room
01:04:48 i feel like i'm in the room and i'm like like i'm like the friend that got to sit down and listen
01:04:54 like oh yeah it's a great conversation yeah you know i love conversations so i love listening to them
01:05:00 and i love putting them together and the fact that this podcast has gotten so big it it's stunning to me it
01:05:07 blows me away i never anticipated it never thought for a second
01:05:12 that that stupid thing that i used to do in my couch in my my office was the biggest thing i've
01:05:17 ever done in my life by far like people used to make fun of it like there's a comedy store
01:05:22 documentary that's coming out and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend tom segura
01:05:28 when he first started doing my podcast he would he would be leaving and he would talk to red band he's like what
01:05:31 the is he doing yeah like why is he doing this like who's listening he's like oh some people
01:05:36 like it yeah and it's like nonsense waste of time and like
01:05:42 in the the documentary it shows like 2 episodes hilarious and they don't just like it really
01:05:50 they  they form a friendship with you it's like  even me when people come up to me like
01:05:55 the love in their eyes is kind of beautiful it's weird right yeah it's like you're part of their life yeah
01:06:01 and it i don't know it's it's also heartbreaking because you realize you'll never really get to
01:06:06 know them back like because they they clearly are friends with you
01:06:12 yes yeah and it's sad to see a person who's clearly brilliant and interesting and is friends with you but you don't get a
01:06:19 chance to return that love and  i mean my kids it took them a while
01:06:25 to figure out what's going on but  people come up to me and  you know they would say something
01:06:31 like hey man i love you thanks man all right hey brother nice to meet you my daughter was like sick she's
01:06:36 like do you know him yeah i'm like no i don't know him she's like how does he know you
01:06:43 think this is a very weird conversation i used to have with young kids when i'd explained i do this thing
01:06:49 called the podcast and millions of people listen so now one of my daughters is 12
01:06:56 and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy and he goes to school with her and he's obsessed with me
01:07:01 and so she's weirded out and she says to him i don't think you like me i think you're just into my dad
01:07:06 weirdo she's gonna have that conversation in a few stages in her life oh that hard conversation with a
01:07:12 boyfriend yeah probably yeah that well that's the thing about men too
01:07:19 this this podcast is  my podcast is uniquely masculine i'm a man and i'm i'm not i i'm also a man that
01:07:27 doesn't have to go through some sort of a corporate filter i'm not going through executive
01:07:32 producers who tell me don't don't have this guest on don't talk about that you know that we looked at
01:07:37 focus groups and they don't they don't seem to like when you do this like there's none of that i just and i i
01:07:43 i just do it so if that's so i have a whole podcast where i just talk about cars
01:07:47 and people like i don't want to hear you talk about cars well good congratulations you found what you like here's good news
01:07:54 there's 1500 other ones go listen to the other episodes where i don't talk about cars you know you don't
01:07:59 have to listen and it's not like your brand you just no are who you are and that's what you do
01:08:07 but it's like it's authentically what i'm interested in all the podcasts whether i'm talking
01:08:12 to david fravor about his experience with ufos whether i'm talking to david sinclair about life extension
01:08:18 whether i'm talking to you about artificial intelligence or what it's because i want to
01:08:24 talk to these people and that that resonates i i like when people are into you know i've talked about this before like
01:08:31 things that i have no interest in making furniture but i like this pbs show where this guy makes furniture by hand yeah i love
01:08:37 watching it craftsman because he's so into it yeah he's examining this and polishing that i'm not gonna do that i
01:08:42 don't give a about furniture furniture for me is function like this desk function it works
01:08:48 but i love when people are into it you know and i'm happy that someone can make it and they do a great job
01:08:54 but i'm not i'm not interested in the the task is or the even the finished product as much as i'm interested in
01:09:01 someone's passion for something the passion that they've put into this that shines through
01:09:08 last question i sometimes ask this just for to  what is it to challenge
01:09:15 to make people roll their eyes to make legitimate scientists roll their eyes ask what is the meaning of life
01:09:22 according to joe rogan i do not think there is a meaning i think there's many many meanings of
01:09:28 life i think there's a way to navigate life that's enjoyable i think it requires many things it
01:09:33 requires first of all requires love you have to have loved ones you have to have family
01:09:39 you have to have friends you have to have people that care about you and you have to care about them i think
01:09:44 that is primary then it also requires interests there has to be things that stimulate
01:09:51 you now it could be just a subsistence lifestyle there's many people that believe and practice this  lifestyle of just
01:09:59 living off the land and hunting and fishing and living in the woods and they seem incredibly happy
01:10:04 yeah and there's there's something to be said for that that is an interest right there's something and there's a
01:10:10 there's a direct connection between their actions and their sustenance they get their food
01:10:15 that way they're connected to nature and it's very satisfying for them if you don't have that  i think you need
01:10:23 something that is interesting to you something that's you're passionate about and there's far
01:10:29 too many people that get sucked into living a life where you're just doing a job you're just showing up and putting in
01:10:35 your time and then going home but you don't have a passion for what you're doing and i think that
01:10:41 is that's the recipe for a boring and very unfulfilling life you mentioned love difficult
01:10:48 backtrack what  we talked about the demons and the violence in there somewhere what's the role of
01:10:53 love in this in your own life it's very important man and that's one of the reasons why i'm so
01:11:03  i'm so interested in helping people i'm very interested in people feeling good i like them to feel good i want to help
01:11:11 them i like i like doing things that make them feel like oh you care about me like yeah i care about you
01:11:16 i really do like i want people to feel good i want my family to feel good i want my friends
01:11:21 to feel good i want guests to feel good about the podcast experience you know i i
01:11:27 am i'm a big believer in as much as i can to spread positive energy and joy and happiness
01:11:34 and and relay all the good advice that i've ever gotten all the things that i've learned and if
01:11:39 they can benefit people and i find that those things benefit people and actually improve the quality of
01:11:44 their life or improve their success or improve their relationships or i'm very happy to do that
01:11:50 that means a lot to me the the way we interact with each other is so important it's one of the reasons
01:11:55 why like if someone gets cancelled or you get publicly shamed it's so devastating
01:12:01 because there's all these people that negative all this negative energy coming your way and you feel it as much as you
01:12:06 like to pretend that you you're immune to that kind of stuff and some people do like to pretend that
01:12:12 you feel it there's a there's a tangible force when people are upset at you and that's the same with loved ones or family
01:12:19 or anytime someone's upset at you whether it's a giant group of people or there's a small amount of people that
01:12:25 has an impact on you and your psyche and your physical being so the more
01:12:32 you can spread love and the more love comes back to you you also create this butterfly effect
01:12:37 right because where other people start recognizing like oh you know when he is nice to me
01:12:43 i feel better and i'm going to be nicer to people and when i'm nicer to people they feel better and i feel better and
01:12:48 and it spreads outward and that's one thing that i've done through this podcast i think is i've i've imparted my
01:12:53 personal philosophy on in in kindness and generosity to other people
01:12:59 yeah i mean to correct you you didn't do it the ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain have
01:13:05 up the ideas that are all alive in the air made their way into my head love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading
01:13:11 ideas they figured out yes probably man probably so as far as like
01:13:21  the meaning of life that's that's a bit without that you have nothing you know one of the
01:13:26 big biggest failures in life is to be extremely successful financially but everybody hates you
01:13:30 everybody hates you and you're just miserable and alone and angry and depressed and sad
01:13:35 you know when you you hear about rich famous people that commit suicide like wow you missed the mark you got some parts right
01:13:43 but you put too many eggs in one basket you put too many eggs in the financial basket or the success basket or the
01:13:49 accomplishment basket and not enough in the friendship and love basket and there's a balance to that
01:13:55 and what i talked about the violence and all that stuff like that to me is me understanding recognizing that is me
01:14:02 trying to achieve that balance it's so like go kill those demons so that this boat is level
01:14:08 you know because if it's not then the boat is like this and then everything's all up and every time we hit a
01:14:13 wave things fall apart balance that boat out figure it out like know who you are
01:14:18 some people don't have that problem at all some people they could just go for walks and they're cool as a cucumber
01:14:24 i need more you know i need kettle bells i need a heavy bag i need  i need the echo bike you know
01:14:30 air assault bike i need some hardcore and if i don't get that i don't feel good
01:14:36 so i figured that out too and that makes me a nicer person and that makes my interactions nicer it makes
01:14:43 it it changes the quality of my my friendships and my relationships with people i think 
01:14:50 we mentioned eurolink i can i can certainly  guarantee that this is one of the memories i'll be replaying
