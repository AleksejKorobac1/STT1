00:00:02 42 billion dollars that is the amount of money grossed by films at the global box office in 2019
00:00:09 impressive definitely surprising probably not especially when you consider that global
00:00:13 box office revenues have increased year over year since 2005. that was of course until covered as
00:00:20 you'd expect the pandemic has devastated hollywood resulting in an unprecedented 71 declining global box office revenue
00:00:27 worse yet we all have to go another year without daniel craig's no time to die a title that has since taken on somewhat
00:00:33 of an eerie meaning putting the absence of james bond aside movie ticket sales have actually been on
00:00:38 the decline for nearly two decades despite a steady increase in population over the same period
00:00:43 so if people are going to the movie theaters less often and they are then what exactly is driving the growth
00:00:49 behind global box office revenue to answer this question you have to understand the economics of hollywood
00:00:55 how do movies get funded what is the role of government subsidies and alternative revenue sources
00:01:00 how can a movie gross more than its budget and still lose money and finally what are the economics behind movie

00:02:35 the undisputed movie capital of the world this 30 square mile area plays an instrumental role in shaping western
00:02:42 culture in addition to this chief role hollywood is also a very material component of the us economy
00:02:47 if you've ever sat through a movie credit reel it's little wonder why the film and television
00:02:52 industry supports nearly two and a half million jobs per perspective that's greater than the
00:02:56 number of people employed as farmers or miners keep in mind these are good paying jobs according to the motion picture association
00:03:05 the industry pays more than 181 billion dollars in wages each year that's impressive because it also means
00:03:10 that people employed in this sector earn around 47 more than the national average although
00:03:15 when you consider how expensive it is to live in los angeles that's essentially what you'd expect
00:03:21 so what exactly is driving hollywood's growth 20 years ago the answer would have been in person movie going
00:03:27 the studios made the movies the theaters showed the movies everyone was happy things were simpler
00:03:32 then but considering that you're now watching this video on youtube it's probably not a surprise to learn that
00:03:37 the way that we consume content has changed drastically as a result us movie going has been on
00:03:43 the decline for nearly two decades but how can there be growth at the box office if fewer people are going to the movies
00:03:51 the answer is mostly two-fold increasing inflation and decreasing demand going to the movies is simply more
00:03:57 expensive than it used to be in 1910 the average price of a movie ticket was a mere 7 cents
00:04:03 today that number is a relatively staggering 9.26 cents a 132 fold increase on top of this
00:04:11 fewer people are physically going to the movies despite an increase in relative population notably some recent films like greenland
00:04:18 and disney's mulan have cut out theatres altogether and are now releasing films online directly to viewers
00:04:25 this may sound like a novel concept but it's not shark tank star and billionaire mark
00:04:29 cuban pioneered a very similar distribution concept in the early 2000s the dawn of online hd video long before
00:04:36 disney and netflix it was cuban's magnolia pictures which released films through the internet and
00:04:43 theaters at the same time however it's worth noting that this concept wasn't actually successful
00:04:47 as evidenced by the fact that you probably haven't seen any movies using this dual distribution model
00:04:52 arguably the biggest beneficiary of all of these technological advancements in the past two decades
00:04:57 excluding you the consumer have been the largest film studios also known as the big six the big six
00:05:04 dominate the box office charts part of the reason why these studios are so big is because they have big budgets budgets
00:05:09 that are often in the hundreds of millions of dollars but how do movies get funded
00:05:19 movies are companies not just in the profit driven sense i mean movies are literally companies
00:05:24 just like apple google and australia studios incorporate their films for a number of legal reasons
00:05:31 but the main reason they incorporate is to raise capital in this way films are like pre-revenue startups
00:05:37 they don't have a product yet and they need funding just like the startup world there's an investor ecosystem for the
00:05:43 movie world an investor ecosystem that looks for the same things that all investors look for
00:05:48 the opportunity to earn solar returns from a venture managed by an equally solid management team naturally this
00:05:54 raises a couple of questions who provides the funding to the studios and do you need a nine-figure budget to make
00:06:02 a wildly successful movie to answer the latter question first absolutely not
00:06:07 case in point the supernatural horror film paranormal activity made on a shoestring budget of just 15
00:06:13 grand the film brought in nearly 200 million dollars another notable success is supersize me
00:06:20 a documentary about fast food which in its own right is also a real life horror film like
00:06:24 paranormal activity the movie was shot on a modest budget 65 it also crushed it at the box office
00:06:32 raking in over 29 million dollars most of the viral success behind these kinds of indie films is attributed to
00:06:37 the internet tech savvy filmmakers now have an infinite array of ways to advertise
00:06:42 their movies sites like youtube can make your trailer go viral
00:06:47 and after going viral you can then sell your movie's rights to a platform like netflix or amazon prime
00:06:52 but the internet isn't only disrupting how films are distributed it's also disrupting how they are financed
00:06:59 namely thanks to crowdfunding platforms which enable you to invest in movies and receive royalties as for producing big budget
00:07:06 films the investors in these movies are usually private equity firms and hedge funds although it's not uncommon to also see
00:07:13 family officers as investors as well as ultra high net worth individuals almost always these investors are
00:07:19 limited partners or lps meaning they take a passive ownership stake and don't get involved in the
00:07:24 movies production process this makes sense because hedge funds and private equity firms are often looking
00:07:28 to allocate capital towards what financial analysts call uncorrelated return streams which is a
00:07:34 pretentious way of saying an alternative asset that has an income stream unaffected by the forces that usually
00:07:39 affect other types of traditional assets like stocks music is another perfect example of this
00:07:45 one that is also very synergistic with the movie industry look no further than any sony pictures
00:07:50 movie featuring music from you guessed it a sony owned record label like columbia records
00:07:56 but even with the financial backing of large institutions studios rely on two other important
00:08:00 funding sources paid product placement and government subsidies paid product placement it's the reason
00:08:08 why you see so many brand advertisements in movies some of which are just laughably
00:08:12 unbearable yes and it's the choice of a new generation for studios pay product placement is a
00:08:19 critical fundraising tool one that allows them to retain a larger ownership stake in their movies
00:08:25 without it a studio would have no other choice but to raise more money from their investors
00:08:29 which in turn dilutes the studio's ownership so how big of a deal is paid product
00:08:33 placement well if you're an indie filmmaker it's usually not even a remote possibility
00:08:39 good luck trying to get apple to sponsor your home movie but if you're a major studio it's an entirely different story
00:08:45 consider the james bond franchise the upcoming film no time to die will reportedly feature over 90 million
00:08:51 dollars in paid product placement which equates to about 36 percent of the movie's entire budget
00:08:57 it's worth noting that james bond is more of an outlier most movies don't receive pay product
00:09:02 placement revenue anywhere near those numbers but perhaps the most interesting thing about paid product placement
00:09:07 is that sometimes you don't even know it's there and that's the point it's meant to be subliminal you're not
00:09:13 supposed to notice it the reason films don't disclose their brand placements is simple
00:09:18 it's not legally required the movie industry argues that making disclosures mid-movie would be disruptive
00:09:24 which makes sense after all fans of james bond already know that daniel craig is getting paid to drive that
00:09:29 slick aston martin the real ethical issue here one that is arguably criminally overlooked
00:09:35 is paid product placement targeting children children who are easily manipulated and don't
00:09:40 have any concept whatsoever of the dynamic between brands and their non-transparent advertising
00:09:45 case in point the sugary pastry company cinnabon sponsoring the bee movie movies aren't even the biggest recipient of paid
00:09:51 product placement dollars not even close that crown belongs to tv this lack of disclosure is a double
00:09:58 standard that doesn't receive nearly enough attention if a youtuber is paid any amount of money to promote anything
00:10:05 the fcc strictly requires a creator to be transparent and disclose such information to their audience
00:10:10 failure to do so can result in a hefty fine and potentially jail time on the other hand film and tv
00:10:16 essentially get a pass this leads us to our next topic hollywood's very powerful lobbying industry
00:10:23 and the role of government subsidies lobbyists for hollywood argue that the movie business is tough
00:10:29 so of course they need a tax break now hearing this alone as a state legislator should be enough
00:10:33 justification to at least pause because as mentioned before if you exclude 2020
00:10:40 hollywood has never done better as a reminder global box office revenues haven't declined in over 15 years
00:10:47 the idea of a booming movie industry which doesn't even make any money on its films needing a tax break is a little
00:10:53 ridiculous in and of itself even the independent non-profit tax foundation describes these incentives
00:10:59 as failing to live up to their promises to encourage economic growth overall and to raise tax revenue these tax
00:11:05 breaks are called mpis or movie production incentives they are exactly what their name implies
00:11:11 tax incentives for the movie industry to incentivize film production or at least in theory that's what
00:11:16 they're supposed to do they're provided on a state-by-state basis and most states have them
00:11:22 originally conceived in 1992 by the state of louisiana the concept was to bring film production
00:11:26 jobs to the state and to their credit they have created jobs albeit almost
00:11:32 always at a very high cost to the taxpayers in massachusetts for example one study found that each film job
00:11:38 created by the state's mpi program cost taxpayers a whopping 324 thousand dollars as any rational economist will tell you
00:11:46 taxpayers always pick up a tab for ineffective government subsidies but wait you say what about independent filmmakers
00:11:53 surely it's not only the most powerful studios that don't actually need these subsidies who can take
00:11:58 advantage of them unfortunately not before being eligible to enjoy these sweet tax breaks production companies
00:12:03 are often required to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and as if that wasn't bad enough
00:12:09 many states even offer mpis with cash rebates on qualified purchases now to be clear we're not talking about
00:12:15 tax rebates we're talking about production cost rebates meaning costs
00:12:20 that are incurred by the studio which the studio then submits to the state for reimbursement specifically costs that are considered
00:12:27 qualified a percentage of which is kicked back to the studio typically around 20 to 25 percent
00:12:33 in a way it's the same concept as cash back rewards except to be eligible for these cashback perks
00:12:38 you don't need good credit you just need to be a big studio these production costs submitted to the
00:12:43 state for reimbursement are sometimes artificially inflated you tell the state what you paid for the qualified purchase
00:12:50 and they send you a check for 20 to 25 of the amount that you claim it's basically the honor system
00:12:54 if all of this sounds like it's prone to abuse that's because it is and indeed it has been abused
00:13:01 several film directors have been charged with tax fraud for telling state governments one inflated number
00:13:05 and paying their production staff a significantly lower number as of the time of filming this video 22
00:13:11 states offer cash rebate programs the percentage varies from state to state as does the definition of a
00:13:16 qualified purchase if all of this corrupt corporate lobbying sounds like it's out of a movie
00:13:22 it's not if there's one movie that'll probably never be made by hollywood if movies can be such a great investment
00:13:31 then why do so many hollywood films never generate a profit for their investors despite having tax credits hundreds of
00:13:37 millions of dollars in funding tens of millions in paid product placement and to top it all off
00:13:43 extraordinary sales at the box office which even exceed their budgets two words hollywood accounting
00:13:50 that's not a term that we came up with it's what the industry calls it hollywood's accounting methodology is so
00:13:56 infamously opaque that it even has its own wikipedia page the scheme works by using questionable
00:14:01 legal and sometimes illegal expensing systems to reduce profit consider a movie studio that also owns a
00:14:07 subsidiary costume company on the surface it's a perfect synergy studios make films
00:14:13 films need actors actors need costumes so if you own a studio why not also own a costume company
00:14:19 it's a textbook perfect vertical integration right well not so fast these structures don't work
00:14:24 in reality because there is an obvious conflict of interest namely the studio can mark up
00:14:30 the price of their costumes purposefully over billing their own film this type of conflict of interest profit
00:14:36 shifting happens all the time in hollywood infamously the creator of spider-man stan lee was promised 10
00:14:42 of the net profits from anything based on his characters although the case was later settled with marvel
00:14:48 lee ultimately never received royalties lee is by no means alone screenwriter ed solomon claims that his sony-owned
00:14:54 blockbuster men in black is still not in the black this is after nearly a quarter of a century since its
00:15:00 release and despite grossing over 600 million of a 90 million budget not to mention three sequels
00:15:06 movie studios have precise meanings assigned to terms like net profit in the practice of law the
00:15:12 term you see here is what is known as a defined term almost all contracts have them
00:15:16 and to be clear there's nothing inherently sinister about defined terms that is unless you're a film studio that
00:15:23 decides to define such important words in ways that are intended to be dare i say subjective and thus open to
00:15:29 interpretation in the courts but this raises a different question are movie studios really the villain here
00:15:36 one group that would likely say yes would be the venues that show the studios films
00:15:43 movie theaters movie theaters or cinemas as our viewers in the uk like to call them are not in the movie business movie theaters
00:15:50 are in the refreshment business because amc has the largest theater market share in the us
00:15:54 will use them as a proxy for the industry according to their 2019 annual report food and beverage sales accounted
00:16:00 for nearly a third of the company's total revenue clocking in at 1.7 billion dollars
00:16:07 even more impressive the net margins on that revenue 84 this of course begs the question if
00:16:13 theater companies like amc generate over a billion dollars a year in profit from food and beverages
00:16:19 then why does this industry as a whole lose so much money well in a way the losses are a tad exaggerated
00:16:25 if you look at the last five years of amc's financial performance it certainly doesn't look great sure on
00:16:30 a taxable basis amc lost 149 million dollars in 2019 but if you add back in depreciation
00:16:39 which you should because it's not a real capital expenditure and therefore distorts the real financial picture
00:16:45 you can see that imc had a real net profit of 300 million dollars but even 300 million in quote-unquote
00:16:52 real net profit of five and a half billion in revenue isn't a great business put another way
00:16:57 that means your real net margins are only five percent so why is this food and beverages are obviously not the
00:17:04 problem that segment of the business is a cash cow the answer to this question has to do
00:17:09 with the way theaters charge studios to show their films in the first week of a film's premiere
00:17:15 theaters may only receive 20 to 25 of the film's ticket price with the remaining 75 to 80
00:17:20 going to the studio in the second week the revenue share changes with a higher percentage of revenue
00:17:25 going to the theater and less to the studio by around week six the theatre is usually receiving the majority of the
00:17:31 movie ticket revenue this continues every week until the movie is eventually no longer shown in theaters
00:17:38 this adaptive revenue share is precisely the reason why your popcorn is so darn expensive if you think that studios are simply
00:17:44 squeezing movie theaters well you're not alone disney received a ton of backlash after they told theaters
00:17:50 that they'd be receiving a zero percent revenue share on all ticket sales during the premiering week of their new star
00:17:55 wars film that may not seem like a fair deal but if you run a movie theater
00:18:00 what are you gonna do suppose you own a theater and decide not to show the new star wars film because you don't
00:18:05 generate any revenue from the ticket sales you risk losing potential customers who will take their business to a different
00:18:10 theater that is showing the new star wars film in the eyes of disney's critics
00:18:15 they are like the monopolizing death star crushing theaters one galaxy at a time but to the capitalist jedi looking in
00:18:22 from the outside we can see that such an argument is a difficult one to win disney isn't a monopoly they're not
00:18:28 using darth vader's invisible force choke to strangle theaters into showing their movie
00:18:33 no not even close the reason disney has the pricing power they're criticized for holding is because
00:18:39 they simply make great movies that is the beauty of the intergalactic system we call free market economics
