00:00:03 nuclear energy creates an uneasy feeling of danger for many people ancient and dangerous minerals are
00:00:09 concentrated to awaken seemingly unnatural powers creating horribly toxic elements that if
00:00:13 they escape can and have killed people in horrible ways how many people has nuclear energy killed
00:00:29 nuclear energy has been a thing since 1951 and since then there have been around 30 reported accidents globally
00:00:37 most of them were pretty minor compared to the two disasters everybody is familiar with
00:00:42 fukushima and chernobyl chernobyl is undoubtedly the worst nuclear accident in history for a number of reasons
00:00:49 the reactor technology was old and ill-prepared for emergencies and the government response was slow and
00:00:53 more concerned about image than damage control still only 31 people died directly in the accident
00:01:02 but what makes nuclear energy scary is not reactors blowing up but the radiation they release so the
00:01:08 real question is how many deaths through cancer and other diseases will chernobyl cause
00:01:14 here things get really complicated because you dip right into controversy and just discussing the different
00:01:20 estimates and how they were calculated deserves a video of its own the most pessimistic estimate comes from a study
00:01:25 commissioned by the european green party and projects up to 60 000 premature deaths by the year 2065.
00:01:34 most scientific studies come up with numbers much lower than this the who has estimated that in total the
00:01:39 long-term death toll will be around four thousand while the un scientific committee on the
00:01:46 effects of atomic radiation concluded that even this figure could be too high for more details on this
00:01:53 check our research document the second big nuclear accident was fukushima daiichi in 2011. fukushima did not only operate
00:02:01 with much better technology that was less dangerous in the first place much better security measures were
00:02:05 in place and the official response was fast and decisive and so the current death toll is only 573.
00:02:15 the major difference here is that these deaths were not a consequence of radiation they were indirect deaths from the
00:02:21 stress of the evacuation of the areas around the reactors and occurred almost entirely in older populations
00:02:28 estimates of the possible long-term deaths from radiation vary widely from none at all to about one thousand
00:02:34 in terms of the other long-term consequences an increase in thyroid cancer in children has been observed
00:02:41 but according to the who this is related to the increased screening rate by 2018 there had been only one
00:02:48 confirmed death among workers as a result of radiation-induced lung cancer now let's compare this to renewable energy
00:02:58 solar wind and geothermal energy basically only cause deaths as a result of construction and
00:03:03 maintenance accidents unfortunately their current share of global energy is pretty low
00:03:10 the major player in renewable energy is hydropower which mostly means building dams and letting water flow through turbines
00:03:16 from a higher elevation to a lower elevation in total hydro has been the most fatal in terms
00:03:21 of accidents with hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last half century
00:03:29 one accident clearly stands out the 1975 bangko hydroelectric dam failure in China  which has
00:03:35 striking similarities to chernobyl old technology poor design and poor management by authoritarian governments
00:03:42 concerned about appearances in a nutshell a massive typhoon triggered intense flooding that
00:03:47 destroyed the dam and subsequently a number of smaller dams in a chain reaction
00:03:53 unleashing a flood of over 15 billion cubic meters of water in total kilometer wide waves as high as
00:03:59 buildings devastated thousands of square kilometers of countryside and countless communities all in all the
00:04:05 death toll from just this one accident and its direct consequences is estimated to lie between 85 000 to 240
00:04:16 nuclear and renewable energy are actually negligible in comparison to the real killer energy source
00:04:23 fossil fuel the most widely used source of energy and electricity when we burn fossil
00:04:27 fuels to heat up water and make turbines spin or to cause mini explosions to move cars with internal
00:04:33 combustion engines gases like ozone sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are released into
00:04:40 the atmosphere breathing in these gases disrupts lung function which aggravates chronic
00:04:46 conditions like asthma and bronchitis and causes a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases
00:04:53 but even more dangerous is the fine particle pollution burning fossil fuels causes a mixture of solid and liquid droplets
00:04:59 of poisonous substances as small as 2.5 microns in diameter they easily find their way deep into
00:05:06 your lungs and increase the risk of deadly diseases like lung cancer stroke and heart disease
00:05:13 fossil fuel related air pollution is the number one cause of environmental related deaths in the world
00:05:20 according to the who it accounts for 29 of all cases of lung cancer 17 percent of deaths from acute lower respiratory infection
00:05:29 24 from stroke 25 from ischemic heart disease and 43 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
00:05:37 all in all outside air pollution adds up to the deaths of 4 million people each year what makes air pollution especially
00:05:44 problematic and sinister is the fact that the damage it causes happens very gradually
00:05:49 which makes it hard for our brains that didn't evolve with subtle dangers in mind to realize the
00:05:55 scope of the problem collectively air pollution from fossil fuels is estimated to have killed around
00:06:05 100 million people in the past 50 years but wait is that really fair fossil fuels also provide
00:06:11 over 80 percent of global energy so it makes sense that they cause the most deaths so let's compare deaths per energy unit
00:06:21 deaths per energy unit produce a few studies have compared the death rates from different energy sources per
00:06:27 one terawatt hour that's about the annual energy consumption of 27 000 eu citizens or 12
00:06:35 600 u.s citizens to produce that much energy for one year coal causes 25 deaths oil causes 18
00:06:43 and natural gas 3. renewable energy causes one death every few decades and nuclear in the worst case nuclear
00:06:49 energy would cause one death every 14 years one study even found that nuclear energy actually saved
00:06:59 2 million lives between 1971 and 2009 by displacing fossil fuels from the global energy mix
00:07:05 the numbers are clear even when using wildly pessimistic numbers nuclear energy is among the safest forms
00:07:11 of energy generation and at a time when we're struggling to slow down rapid climate change
00:07:18 it's a really valuable low carbon option however all these facts still leave one major argument that is fielded against nuclear power
00:07:25 opponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear waste and its lack of long-term storage solutions
00:07:31 is an unacceptable problem and risk while proponents of nuclear energy say that until renewable energies are
00:07:37 able to cover the complete energy demands of mankind it's arguably safer to store nuclear
00:07:42 waste for the time being than to inhale poisonous gases and promote rapid climate change
00:07:49 but a detailed discussion about nuclear waste would go too far here more about it in our sources let us know
00:07:56 if you'd like a whole video about it so looking at the comparative death rates it's a bit concerning that some
00:08:02 countries are replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels mostly coal especially germany and japan
00:08:08 have been the most active in dismantling their nuclear fleet in a ploy to appease the public
00:08:14 the german government shut down 11 of its 17 nuclear facilities and plans to close the remaining
00:08:20 reactors in 2022 the immediate gap in energy production was filled by temporarily increasing
00:08:25 coal production the energy source with the largest health impacts and the worst
00:08:31 consequences for climate change a 2019 analysis concluded that as a consequence the nuclear phase-out has led to 1 100
00:08:40 avoidable deaths per year in germany due to the increased air pollution in the years after 2010
00:08:47 so in conclusion nuclear energy feels way more dangerous than it actually is no matter how you look at it the one
00:08:53 thing we should strive to get rid of as quickly as possible of fossil fuels to prevent the deaths
00:08:58 they cause each year and to slow down climate change regardless of how much you personally
00:09:04 care about climate change issues or which energy source you favor saving millions of lives
00:09:13 should be something we can all agree on maybe you've actually made some kind of resolution to try and be more
