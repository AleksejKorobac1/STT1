00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Gary Kasparov he's considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time
00:00:10 from 1986 until his retirement in 2005 he dominated the chess world ranking world number one for most of those 19
00:00:18 years while he has many historical matches against human chess players in a long arc of history he may be remembered
00:00:27 for his match against the machine IBM's deep blue his initial victories and eventual loss to deep blue captivated
00:00:35 the imagination of the world of what role artificial intelligence systems may play in our civilizations future that
00:00:41 excitement inspired an entire generation of AI researchers including myself to get into the field gary is also a
00:00:50 pro-democracy political thinker and leader a fearless human rights activist and author of several books including
00:00:57 how life imitates chess which is a book on strategy and decision-making winter is coming
00:01:03 which is a book articulating his opposition to the Putin regime and deep thinking which is a book on the role of
00:01:10 both artificial intelligence and human intelligence in defining our future this is the artificial intelligence podcast

00:01:25 with me on Twitter Alex Friedman spelled Fri D ma a.m. and now here's my conversation with
00:01:33 Garry Kasparov as perhaps the greatest chess player of all time when you look introspectively
00:01:40 your psychology throughout your career what was the bigger motivator the love of winning or the hatred of losing tough
00:01:51 question I have to confess I never heard it before each is again congratulations it's quite
00:01:59 an accomplishment losing was always painful for me it was almost like a physical pain because I knew that if I
00:02:10 lost the game it's just because I made a mistake so it I always believed that the result of the game had to be decided by
00:02:22 the quality of my play okay you may say it sounds arrogant but it helped me to move forward because I always knew that
00:02:30 there was room for improvement so it's the was there the fear the mistake actually fear of mistake guarantees
00:02:38 mistakes and the difference between top players and very top is that it's the ability to make a decision without
00:02:46 predictable consequences you don't know what's happening it's intuitively I can go this way or that way and they're
00:02:53 always hesitations people like your you're just you know at the crossroad you can go right you can go left you can
00:02:58 go straight you can turn and go back and the consequences are just very uncertain yes you have certain ideas what happens
00:03:07 on the right or on the left or on just you know if you go straight but it's not enough to make well calculated choice
00:03:15 and when you play chess at the very top is it's it's it's about your inner strength so I can make this decision I
00:03:23 will stand firm and I'm not going to waste my time because I feel confidence that I will go through going back to the
00:03:33 original question is I would say neither it's just it's the it's love for winning hateful losing there were important
00:03:42 elements psychological elements but the key element it's the I would say the the driving force was
00:03:52 always my passion for for making it make any difference it's just I can move forward and I can always its I can
00:04:00 always enjoy not just playing but creating something new creating something new how do you think about
00:04:06 that it's just finding new ideas in the openings you know some regional plan in the middle game it's actually that
00:04:13 helped me to make the transition from the game of chess where I wasn't a very top two to another life where I knew I
00:04:20 would not be number one I would don't be necessarily on the top but I could still be very active and productive by my
00:04:30 ability to make the difference by influencing people say joining the democratic movement in Russia or talking
00:04:38 to people about human-machine relations there's so many things were I knew my influence may not be as decisive as in
00:04:48 chess but still strong enough to help people to make their choices so you can still create something new that makes a
00:04:56 difference in the world outside of chess but wait you've kind of painted a beautiful picture of your motivations to
00:05:04 chess to create something new to look for those moments of some brilliant new ideas but were you haunted by something
00:05:13 see you make it seem like to be at the level you are at you can get away without having demons without without
00:05:23 having fears without being driven if by some of the darker forces I mean you sound almost religious you know dark
00:05:33 forces to reach you know humans and we do have a pole for a priest now just let's go back to you to to these crucial
00:05:43 chess moments where I had to make big decisions as I said it's it's you know it was all about my belief from very
00:05:51 early days that I can make all the difference by playing well or by making mistakes so the yes I I always had an
00:05:59 opponent across the chessboard opposite me but no matter how strong their point was well they just were ordered player or
00:06:07 another wall champion I can't leak or proof I haven't called respect for my opponent I still believe that it's it's
00:06:17 up to me to make the difference and I I knew I I was not invincible I made mistakes I made some blunders and you
00:06:28 know with age I mean more blunders okay good I knew it but it's it's still you know it's it's very much for me to be
00:06:37 decisive factor in the game I mean even now look I just you know my latest chess experience was horrible I mean I get
00:06:43 played carolallan Khurana fatphobia Khurana it's number two number two number three player well these days we
00:06:50 play this 960 which they fish for so call Fisher a random chairs from shuffling pieces yeah I lost very badly
00:06:56 but it's because I made mistakes I mean I had so many winning positions I mean 15 years ago I would have crushed him so
00:07:03 and it's it's you know while I lost I got so much upset I mean I know as I said in my interview I can fight any
00:07:11 opponent but not my biological clock it's fighting time with is is is always a losing proposition but even today at
00:07:20 age 56 you know I I knew that you know I could play great game I couldn't finish it because I didn't have enough energy
00:07:26 or just you know I couldn't have the same level concentration but you know in number of games where I completely
00:07:32 outplayed one of the top players in the world I mean gave me a certain amount of pleasure that is even today I haven't
00:07:40 lost my touch not the same you know okay the jaws are not as as strong and DTS are another sharp but I could get him
00:07:48 just you know almost you know two on the ropes Oh got it it's still got it and that's you know and it's it's my wife
00:07:55 said it well I mean she said look Gary it's somehow it's something you just fighting viola your biological clock
00:08:01 it's just you know maybe it's a signal because you know the goddess of chess since you spoke lean religious the
00:08:08 goodness of chess Keysha maybe she didn't wound you twin because you know if you could beat number
00:08:14 - number three pride in the world I mean this is this one of the better top players who just recently played World
00:08:20 Championship match if you could beat him it's that was really bad for the game of chess just what people who say oh look
00:08:26 the game of chess you know it's it's it's not make any progress the game is just you know it's it's totally devalued
00:08:33 because Italy the guy coming out of retirement you know just you know winning games maybe that was good for
00:08:38 chess not good for you but it's okay I've been following your logic we should always look for you know demons you know
00:08:46 superior forces and other things that did you know if not dominate our lives but somehow in a play a significant role
00:08:56 in in the outcome yeah so the goddess's chess had to send a message yeah okay okay so Gary you should do something else
00:09:05 time now for a question that you have heard before but give me a chance you've dominated the chess world for
00:09:14 twenty years even still got it is there a moment you said you always look to create something new is there is there
00:09:22 games or moments where you're especially proud of in terms of your brilliance of a new creative move we've talked about
00:09:29 mikhail tall as somebody who was aggressive and creative chess player in your own game look
00:09:36 you mentioned mikhail call it's very aggressive very sharp player famous ways combinations and sacrifices even called
00:09:46 magician from riga so for his very unique style but any any world champion you know it's yeah was a creator some of
00:09:56 them were so flamboyant and flash like call some of their world no just you know less discerned at the chessboard
00:10:05 like Tigran Petrosian but every world champion every top player brought something into the game of chess and
00:10:11 each contribution was priceless because it's not just about sacrifices of course amateurs they enjoy you know the
00:10:18 brilliant games where pieces being sacrificed it's all just you know pieces are hanging and and it's all of a sudden
00:10:26 you know being material down rube or just you know queen down the the the weaker side delivers the the final blow
00:10:35 on just you know amazing opponent's king but this there are other kinds of beauty slow positioning when you ring you know
00:10:43 looking for witnesses and just and and gradually really strangling your opponent and eventually delivering sort
00:10:51 of a positional masterpiece yeah so I think I I made more difference in the game of chess then I could I
00:10:57 could have imagined when I started playing and the reason I thought it was time for me to leave is just I mean I
00:11:07 knew that I was not I was not no longer the position to bring bring the same kind of contribution the same kind of
00:11:20 new knowledge into the game so and going back I could immediately look at my games again sounds only corpus not just
00:11:29 I won the match in 1985 and became world champion at age 22 but there were at least two games in that match of course
00:11:37 the last one game 24 that was decisive game of the match i won and became world champion but also the
00:11:45 way a wise was it was a very hard game and i found a unique maneuver that was absolutely new and it became some sort
00:11:53 of just a typical now though just when the move was made was made at the on the board and put on display a lot of people
00:12:02 thought it was ugly so and another game game 16 and the match or I just also managed to outlay Karpov completely was
00:12:08 black pieces just you know paralyzing his entire army in its own its own camp technically or psychologically or was
00:12:18 that a mix of both in game 16 yeah it I think it was a big blow to Karpov I think it was a big psychological victory
00:12:23 for a number of reasons one the score was equal at a time and the world champion you know by the rules could
00:12:31 retain his title in case of a tie so we still have no before game 16 we have nine games to go and also it was some
00:12:38 sort of a bluff because neither me nor Karpov saw the reputation of this opening idea and and I think it
00:12:46 says for carpel it was double blow because not that he lost the game I should triple blow he lost the game it
00:12:51 was a brilliant game and I played impeccably after you know justice this opening Bluff and then you know they
00:12:57 discovered that it was a bluff so it's the again I didn't know it I wasn't bluffing so that's why by it happens very often
00:13:03 it's when you know some ideas could be refuted and it's just what I found out and this is again going back to your you
00:13:10 know spiritual theme is that and it's you could spend a lot of time working and when I say you could it's just it's
00:13:16 it's in the 80s in the 90s it does happen these days because everybody has a computer you could immediately see if
00:13:21 it works or it doesn't work machines show the refutation in the split of a second but many of the our
00:13:28 analysis in the eighties or in the 90s they were not perfect simply because we're humans and they're just you you
00:13:35 analyze the game you look for some fresh ideas and then test it happens that there was something that you missed
00:13:42 because the level of concentration at the chessboard it's different from one that when you analyze the game just
00:13:50 moving the pieces around but somehow if you spend a lot of time at the chessboard preparing so in your studies
00:13:59 with your coaches hours and hours and hours and nothing of what you found could had materialized on the our own
00:14:09 chests on the chess board somehow these hours helped I don't know I always helped you it's it's as if you know the
00:14:18 amount of work you did could be transformed into some sort of spiritual energy that helped you to come up with
00:14:27 other great ideas during the board again even if it was there was no direct connection between your preparation and
00:14:34 your victory in the game there was always some sort of invisible connection between the amount of work you did your
00:14:42 dedication to actually to you and your passion to discover new ideas and your ability during the game add the chess
00:14:49 board when the clock was ticking we still had ticking clock not so to come up with some some some
00:14:57 brilliancy and them and I also can mention many games from the 90s so it's the obviously all amateurs would pick up
00:15:06 my game against Veselin Topalov in 1999 and we can say again because it was a Bruin game
00:15:12 the black king traveled from from its own camp to into D into in the white scam across the entire board it doesn't
00:15:21 happen often trust me as you know in in in indie games were professional players top professional players so that's why I
00:15:27 visually it was one of the most impressive victories but I could bring to your attention many other games that
00:15:37 were not so impressive for for amateurs not so note so beautiful just guess it's sacrifice always beautiful you
00:15:45 sacrificed asses and then and then eventually you have so there are very few resources left and you you you use
00:15:53 them just to to to to crush your your opponent basically to it's you have to make the kink because you have almost
00:16:00 almost nothing nothing nothing left at your disposal but I you know I up to the very end in less and less but still up
00:16:09 to the very end I always had games with some sort of you know interesting ideas and and games that gave me great
00:16:17 satisfaction but I think it's what happened from 2005 up to you these days was also a very very big accomplishment
00:16:26 since you know I had to find myself to sort of relocate myself yeah we channel the creative energies exactly do you
00:16:35 find something worth feel comfortable even confident that my participation still makes the difference beautifully put
00:16:44 so let me ask perhaps a silly question but sticking our chests for just a little longer
00:16:50 where do you put Magnus Carlsen in the current world champion in a list of all time greats in terms of style moments of
00:16:58 brilliance consistency it's a tricky question you know the moment you start ranking yeah well do something it's the
00:17:05 I think it's it's it's not fair because it's any new generation knows much more about the
00:17:15 game than their previous one so when people say Gary was the greatest Fischer was the greatest Magnus was the greatest
00:17:23 it disregard the fact that the great players of the past where the last year have a plank looking I mean they knew so
00:17:29 little about chess by today's standards today just any kid you know that spent few years you know and  with his or
00:17:37 her chess computer when knows much more about the game simply just because you actually have access to this information
00:17:42 and it has been discovered generation after generation we added more and more knowledge to the game of chess it's
00:17:50 about the gap between the world champion and the rest of the field so it's the now if you look at the gap then proud
00:17:58 official you know could be on top but very short period of time then you should also add a time factor yeah I was
00:18:05 on top not as big as but but much longer so so and also unlike Fischer I will succeed in beating next generation yeah
00:18:13 here's the question yeah let's see if you still got the fire speaking of the next generation because you did succeed
00:18:19 beating the next generation it's close okay well Anand short Anand the sheer of chromic is already 12 years younger so
00:18:26 that's a neck that's but still yet I I competed with them and I just had beat most of them and and I was still
00:18:34 dominant when I left at age of the 41 so back to Magnus Madras right consistency is phenomenal
00:18:44 the reason Magnus is on top and it seems unbeatable today Magnus is is a lethal combination of Fischer on Karpov
00:18:53 but just very it's very unusual because Fischer style was very dynamic just fighting to the last point just using
00:19:00 every resource available Karpov was very different as just yet an unparalleled ability to use the every piece with a
00:19:08 maximum effect just it's minimal resources always produce maximum effects just so now imagine that you merge these
00:19:16 two styles say oh it is it's it's like you know it's a squeezing every stone for drop of water but but doing it you
00:19:25 know just you know for 50 60 70 80 moves I mean mangas could go on as long as Fisher who is always passion and energy
00:19:30 and at the same time being as meticulous and and and and deadly as corporal by just you know using every little
00:19:39 advantage so and yes good you know very good else it's important I mean physical conditions are by the way very important
00:19:44 so a lot of people don't recognize it their latest study shows that chess players burn thousands of calories
00:19:53 during the game so that puts him on the top of this fuel of of the wall chambers but again it's the discussion that is I
00:20:01 so recently in internet whether garry kasparov always peek let's say late 80s could be Magnus Carlsen today I mean
00:20:08 something irrelevant because garriga's probably 1989 okay it's played great chess but still I knew very little about
00:20:16 chess compared to Magnus crossing 2019 who Biden will learn from me as well so that's why yeah
00:20:23 I'm extremely cautious in making any judgment that involves you know time gaps you ask you know soccer fans so who
00:20:31 is your favorite Pele Maradona or Messi yeah yeah who's your favorite Messi miss because maybe because he's younger but
00:20:41 that's simple your instinct answer is correct because you saw you didn't say marathon in action I saw all of them in
00:20:47 action so that's why but it's but since you know when I was you know just following it in air just it's pillion
00:20:52 and Maradona they were just you know there were big stars and it's Macy's already just get I I was gradually
00:20:59 losing interest other things so I remember Pele 1970 the final match Brazil Italy so that's the first world
00:21:06 war World Cup soccer I watched so that's the and and actually my answer when it just where that just you know I because
00:21:12 I I was asked this question as well so I say that is this while it's impossible to make a choice I would sue probably go
00:21:18 with Maradona for simple reason the Brazilian team in 1970 could have won without Collette it was absolutely great
00:21:24 still could have won maybe but it is the Argentinian team in 1986 without Maradona would not be in
00:21:32 the 5s so this is and Messi he still has that's not good argue for that for an hour but yes you could say if you ask
00:21:39 Maradona if you look in his eyes especially let's say Gary Kasparov 99 he would have said I was sure as hell would
00:21:49 be magnus carlsen it's just simply the confidence fire simply because simply because again it's just a so mean action
00:21:55 so this again it's it's the age factor as important therefore is a passion and energy and and being equipped with all
00:22:03 modern ideas but again then you make in a very just important assumption that you could empower Gary Kasparov 89 with
00:22:10 all ideas that have been accumulated over 30 years that would not be Garrigus part that would be someone else because
00:22:17 again I belong to 1989 I was way ahead of the field and I you know a bit Karpov several times in World Championship
00:22:25 matches and I crossed 2,800 which by the way if you look at the chest in rating which is just it's even today so this is
00:22:33 this is the rating that I retire so that says it's still you know it's just it's a it's a top two to three so that says
00:22:39 this is kerwin and eaglets about the same rating now and I crossed 2,100 in 1990 we just look at the inflation when
00:22:47 I cross 2,800 in in 1990 there was only one player in 2700 category Anatoly Karpov now he had more than 50 so just
00:22:53 you see this so if you add inflation so I think my 28:51 it could probably could be more
00:23:02 valuable as Magnus 2882 which was highest rating but anyway yeah you know so many hypotheticals you're lost to IBM
00:23:12 gee blue in 1997 in my eyes there's one of the most seminal moments in the history again I apologize for being
00:23:18 romanticized in the notion but in the history of our civilization because humans as the civilizations for century
00:23:28 saw chess as you know the peak of what man can accomplish of intellectual mastery right and that moment when a
00:23:36 machine could beat a human being was inspiring to just an entire anyone who cares about science innovation
00:23:45 the entire generation of AI researchers and yet to you that laws at least if reading your face was seemed like a
00:23:54 tragedy extremely painful like you said physically painful why when you look back at your psychology that lost why
00:24:01 was it so painful when you're not able to see the seminal nature of that moment Oh or was that exactly why was that
00:24:14 powerful as I already said losing was painful physically passing and the match I lost in 1997 was not the first match I
00:24:22 lost to a machine it was the first match I lost period yes that's oh yeah it's right yeah that
00:24:36 makes all the difference to me yes first time I lost it's just now I lost and the reason I was so angry that I just you
00:24:47 know I had suspicions that my loss was not just the result of my bad play yes SoDo I played quite poorly you know just
00:24:52 when you started looking at the games today I made tons of mistakes but you know I had all reasons to believe that
00:25:00 you know there were other other factors that had nothing to do with the game of chess and that's what I was angry but
00:25:05 look it was 22 years ago it's what under the bridge we can analyze this match and this is with
00:25:12 everything you said I I agree it was probably one exception is that considering chess you know as the sort
00:25:19 of as a pinnacle of intellectual activities what's our mistake because you know we just thought oh it's a it's a game of
00:25:26 the highest intellect and I just you know you have to be so you know intelligent and as you could see things
00:25:32 that you know the or the ordinary ordinary mortals could not see it's a game and all machines had to do with
00:25:42 this game is just to make fewer mistakes not to solve the game because the game cannot be solved I mean according to
00:25:48 Shannon the number of legal moves is ten to the 46 power too many zeroes for any computer to finish the job you know in
00:25:56 in in neck billion years but it doesn't have to it's all about making fewer mistakes and
00:26:04 I think that's the this match actually and what's happened afterwards with other games with go with shrug II with
00:26:13 video games it's a demonstration that it's the machines will always beat humans in what I call closed systems the
00:26:22 moment you build a closed system no matter how this system is called chess go froggie daughter machines will prevail
00:26:33 simply because they will bring down number of mistakes machines don't have to solve it they just have to it's the
00:26:41 way they outplay us it's not by just being more intelligent it's just by by doing something else but eventually it's
00:26:49 just it's capitalizing on our mistakes when you look at the chess machines ratings today in compare compare this to
00:26:56 Magnus Carlsen is the same as comparing Ferrari to Hussein bold it's the the gap is is I meant by chess standards is
00:27:05 insane thirty four thirty five hundred to twenty eight hundred twenty eight twenty eight twenty eight fifty one man
00:27:09 knows it's like difference between macros and AB and an ordinary player from an open international tournament
00:27:17 it's not because machine understands better than magnus carlsen but simply because it's steady machine has steady
00:27:27 hand and I think that is what we we we have to learn from 1997 experience and from further encounters with computers
00:27:35 and sort of the the current state state of affairs was alpha zero you beating other machines the idea that we can
00:27:44 compete with computers in so-called intellectual fields it's it was wrong from the very beginning it's just it's
00:27:52 by the way if 1997 match was not the first victory of machines over our masters or masters yeah no actually it's
00:28:02 I played against first decent chess computers from late from late 80s so I played with the prototype of deep blue
00:28:09 called deep thought in 1989 to repeat chest in New York I want handily those games we played against new chess engines like
00:28:19 Fritz and other programs and then it Steve was Israeli problem jr. that appeared in yeah so there were several
00:28:27 problems I you know I lost few games in blitz I lost one match against the computer a chess engine 1994 rapid chess
00:28:36 so I lost one game 2d blue in 1996 match the manner the match chef I want some people you know tend to forget about it
00:28:41 that I won the first match yes but it's it's we we made a very important psychological mistake thinking
00:28:50 that the reason we lost blitz matches five five minutes games the reason we lost some of the rapid chess matches
00:28:56 twenty five minutes just because we didn't have enough time if you play a longer match we will not make the same
00:29:04 mistake nonsense so this yeah we had more time but we still make mistakes and machine also has more time and machines
00:29:10 machine will always you know I will always be stated inconsistent compared to humans instabilities and
00:29:20 inconsistencies and today we are at a point where yes nobody talks about you know humans playing use machines
00:29:27 machines can offer handicap two to two top players still you know will will will be favoring I think we're just
00:29:34 learning that is it's it's no longer human versus machines it's about human working with machines that's what I
00:29:42 recognized in 1998 just after licking my wounds and spending one year in just in a ruminating Saudi so what's happened at
00:29:49 in this match and I knew that though we still could play against the machines I had two more matches in 2003 playing
00:29:56 both a deep freeze and deep jr. both matches and there's a tie mmm-hmm though this machines were not weaker at least I
00:30:05 promise stronger and II blue and by the way today just app on your mobile phone is probably stronger than the blue
00:30:11 individual I'm not speaking of any bit about chess engines that are so much superior and by the way when you analyze
00:30:17 games who played against the blue 90 97 on your chess engine they'll be laughing yeah so this is and it's also shows
00:30:24 that's how it just changed because just commentators they look at some of our games like game for Game five and
00:30:33 idea now you asked stockfish you asked Houdini you asked Commodore all the leading chess engines yeah within 30 seconds
00:30:39 they will show you how many mistakes booze Gary and D blue mate in the game that was from Pettitte as the as a great
00:30:52 chess match in 1997 well okay so you've made an interesting if you can untangle that comment so now in retrospect it was
00:31:01 a mistake to see chess as the peak of human intellect nevertheless that was done for centuries
00:31:10 so even in Europe because you know you move to the far east they will go there shogi games again I guess some of the
00:31:20 games like you look our board games yes yes yeah so if I push back a little bit so now you say that okay but it was a
00:31:29 mistake to see chess as the epitome and now and then now there's other things maybe like language that conversation
00:31:36 like some of the things that in your view is still way out of reach of computers but inside humans do you think
00:31:43 can you talk about what those things might be and do you think just like chess that might fall soon with the same
00:31:51 set of approaches if you look at alpha zero the same kind of learning approaches as the machines grow in size
00:31:59 no no it's not about in size it's about again it's about understanding the difference but in closed system an
00:32:06 open-ended system so you think that key difference so the board games are closed in terms of the rules that they actions
00:32:13 simple the state space everything is just constrained you think once you open it the machines are lost
00:32:22 not lost but again the effectiveness is very different because machine does not understand the moment it's reaching the
00:32:28 territory of diminishing returns it's the simple in a different way machine doesn't know how to ask right
00:32:37 questions it can ask questions but we'll never tell you which questions are relevant so this D it's like about the
00:32:43 it's the it's a direction so these it's I think is in human relations we have to consider so our role and people many
00:32:50 people feel uncomfortable that is the territory that that belongs to us is is shrinking I'm saying so what you know is
00:32:58 this is eventually will belong to the last few decimal points but it's like having so very powerful gun that's and
00:33:08 and and and all you can do there is slightly you know alter direction of the bullet maybe you know point one the
00:33:17 degree of this angle but that means a mile away ten meters of tourists so so that's we have to recognize that is a
00:33:26 certain unique human qualities that machine's in the foreseeable future will not be able to reproduce and and the
00:33:35 effectiveness of this cooperation collaboration depends on our understanding what exactly we can bring
00:33:42 into the game so the greatest danger is when we try to interfere with machines superior knowledge so that's why I
00:33:47 always say that sometimes you'd rather have by reading these pictures in radiology you may probably prefer an
00:33:56 experienced nurse then rather than having top professor because she will not try to interfere with machines
00:34:02 understanding so this it's very important to know that if machines knows how to do better things in 95% 96% of
00:34:09 territory we should not touch it because it's it happened we it's like in chess recognize they they do it better see
00:34:17 where we can make the difference you mentioned alpha 0 alpha 0 it's a it's actually a first step into what you may
00:34:25 call AI because everything that's being called AI today is just it's it's it's one or another variation of what Claude
00:34:33 Shannon characterized as a brute force is a type a machine whether it's deep blue whether its what's in it and all
00:34:41 these the modern technologies that are being competitors as AI it's still boot force it's the all video it's they do
00:34:50 optimization it's this they are you know they they keep you know improving the way to process human generated data now
00:35:01 alpha zero is is the first step towards you know machine produced knowledge yes which is why what by the way it's quite
00:35:07 ironic that the first company that jumped on that was ideal oh it's in backgammon interesting in that again yes
00:35:16 you just you should you should you should look at IBM is this it's a new gammon it's the it's the he's still
00:35:24 working IBM they had in early nineties it says it's the it's in the program that played in LD alpha 0 type so just
00:35:31 trying to come up with own strategies but because of success of the blue this project had been not abandoned but just
00:35:39 you know it's it's it wasn't was put on call and now it just you know it's it's it's you know it's every talks about
00:35:46 about this t the machines generated knowledge so as a revolutionary and it is but there's still you know many
00:35:54 open-ended questions yes alpha 0 generates its own data many ideas that alpha 0 generating chess work
00:36:03 quite intriguing so I I looked at these games was not just with interest but was no it was quite exciting to learn how
00:36:13 machine could actually you know juggle all the pieces and just play positions with a broken material balance
00:36:19 sacrificing material always being ahead of other programs you know one or two moves ahead by by foreseeing the
00:36:26 consequence not over calculating because machines other machines were at least as powerful in calculating but it's having
00:36:33 this unique knowledge based on discovered patterns after playing 60 million games almost something like
00:36:40 feels like intuition exactly but there's one problem yeah now the simple question if if alpha
00:36:53 powerful computer accompanied by human who could help just to discover certain problems because I already I look at
00:36:59 many alpha 0 games I visited their lab spoke to demis hassabis and his team and I I know that certain witnesses there
00:37:05 now if these wings are exposed and that question is how many games will it take for alpha zero to correct it the answer
00:37:12 is hundreds of thousands even if it keeps losing it it's this because the whole system is based yes so it's now
00:37:19 imagine so that says you can have a human by just making few tweaks so humans are still more flexible and and
00:37:27 as long as we recognize what is what is our raw where we can play sort of so the most valuable part in this collaboration
00:37:36 so it's it will help us to understand what are the next steps in human machine collaboration beautifully put
00:37:42 so let's talk about the thing that machine's certainly don't know how to do yet which is morality machines and
00:37:48 morality but it's another question that I know just it's that's as being asked all the time these days and I I think
00:37:56 it's another phantom that is haunting a general public because it's just being fed with this you know illusions is that
00:38:05 how can we vote machines you know having bias need prejudices you cannot because it's like looking in the mirror and
00:38:12 complaining about what you see if you have certain bias in the society machine will will just follow it it's just it's
00:38:19 it's you know you look at the mirror you don't like what you see there you can you know you can break it you can try to
00:38:26 distort it or you can try to actually change something just itself yes by yourself yes so it's very important
00:38:32 to understand is this is you cannot expect machines to to improve the ease of our society and moreover machines
00:38:40 will simply know just you know amplified yes yeah but the thing is people are more comfortable with other people doing
00:38:50 injustice would being biased we're not comfortable with machines having the same kind of bias so that's a
00:38:58 that's an interesting standard that we place on machines with autonomous vehicles they have to be much safer with
00:39:04 automated systems because they're much safer statistically they're much safer than then of course why would they it's
00:39:13 not of course it's it's not given autonomous vehicles you have to work really hard to make them
00:39:22 is safer i I think it just goes without saying is the the outcome of the of this alcohol competition but comparison is
00:39:30 very clear but the problem is not about being in a safer it's the forty thousand people will show every year died in car
00:39:39 accidents United States and it's its statistics one accident ways with autonomous vehicle and it's front page
00:39:47 of a newspaper yeah this was cycle so it's while people you know kill each other in car accidents because they make
00:39:53 mistakes they make more mistakes for me it's it's it's not a question of course we make more mistakes because we human
00:39:59 yes machines old and by the way no machine will ever reach hundred percent perfection that's not that that's
00:40:04 another important take story that that that is being fed to the public if machine doesn't reach hundreds and
00:40:10 performance is not safe no all you can ask any computer whether it's you know playing chess or or doing the stock
00:40:17 market calculations or driving your autonomous vehicle it's to make fewer mistakes and yes I know it's not you
00:40:24 know it's not easy for us to accept because ah if you know if you have to humans you know colliding in their cars okay
00:40:33 it's like if one of one of these cars is autonomous very vehicle and by the way even if it's humans fault
00:40:38 terrible how could you allow a machine to do it you to run without driver ID at the wheel
00:40:44 so you know let's think of that for a second that double standard the way you felt with your first loss against D blue
00:40:53 were you treating the Machine differently than you would have a human or so what do you think about that
00:40:59 difference between the way we see machines and humans no it's a match and that's why I was angry because I believe
00:41:07 they're lost the match was not you know fairly organized so the states definitely they were unfair advantages
00:41:13 for for IBM and I want to play there another match like rubble mess so you're angered or displeasure was a
00:41:22 more like at the humans behind IBM versus the actual your absolute algorithm absolutely look I I knew at
00:41:27 the time and by the way I was objectively speaking I was stronger at that time so that's that
00:41:33 we added to my anger because I knew I could beat machine yeah yeah so this and that's the and I lost and I knew I was
00:41:39 not well prepared so because they I have to give them credit they did some good work from 1996 and I but I still could
00:41:46 beat the machine so I made too many mistakes also this is the hole is this the publicity around the match so I
00:41:52 underestimated the effect you know just it's Andy and being called the you know the the brains lost and ounce okay no
00:42:04 pressure okay well let me ask so I was born also in the Soviet Union what lessons do you draw from the rise and
00:42:10 fall of the Soviet Union in the 20th century when you just look at this nation that is now look I'm
00:42:19 pushing forward into what Russia is if you look at the long arc of history of the 20th century what do we take away
00:42:29 what do we take away from that I think undemocratic systems totalitarian regimes systems that are based on
00:42:43 controlling their citizens and just every aspect of their life not offering opportunities to for private initiative
00:42:55 central planning systems they duped they just you know they they cannot be driving force for innovation so they in
00:43:03 in history timeline I mean they could cause certain you know distortion of the concept of progress
00:43:12 they by the way call themselves progressive but we know that is this the damage that they cost to to humanity is
00:43:19 just it's it's it's yet to be measured but at the end of the day they fail they fail and it's and the end of the Cold
00:43:27 War was a great triumph of the free world it's not that the free world is perfect it's very important to recognize
00:43:34 its factors I always like to mention you know one of my favorite books a lot of the Rings daddy there's no there's no
00:43:41 absolute good but there's an absolutely good you know it comes in many forms but we all you know it's humans or being
00:43:49 even you know humans from fairy tales or just some sort of mystical creatures it's they you can always find spots on
00:44:00 the song so this is conducting war and just and fighting you for justice there are always things that you know can be
00:44:07 easily criticized and human history is the is a never-ending quest for perfection but we know that there is
00:44:13 absolutely you we know it's for me it's now clear that's I mean it's nobody argues about
00:44:19 Hitler being absolutely well but I think it's very poor against Stalin was absolutely communism caused more damage
00:44:25 than any other ideology in the 20th century and unfortunately while we all know that fascist was condemned but
00:44:32 there was no nerble for common communism and that's why we could see you know still is the these the successors of
00:44:38 Stalin are feeling far more comfortable so you is one of them you highlight a few interesting connections actually
00:44:45 between Stalin and Hitler I mean there that in in terms of the adjusting or clarifying the the history of war to
00:44:54 which they're interesting of course we don't have time so let me ask you I just I just recently delivered a speech in
00:45:01 Toronto yeah at a decent roast of Malta ribbon from pact it's something that I believe you know just you know has must
00:45:07 must be taught in the schools and the world what you had been started by to dictators by signing these these
00:45:15 criminal criminal treaty collusion of two tyrants in August 1939 that the beginning of the world World War two
00:45:22 and the fact that eventually Stalin had no choice but to join allies because Hitler attack him so it just doesn't you
00:45:31 know eliminated the fact that Stalin helped Hitler to start World War two and he was one of the beneficiary said early
00:45:39 at early stage by annexing part of Eastern Europe and as a result of the war with you he annexed always entire
00:45:45 Eastern Europe and for many Eastern European nations the end of the world would you was the beginning of communist
00:45:50 occupation so Putin you've talked about as a man who stands between Russia and democracy
00:46:01 essentially today you've been a strong opponent and critic of Putin let me ask again how much does fear enter your mind
00:46:11 and heart so in 2007 there's this interesting comment from Oleg Kalugin KGB general he said that I do not talk
00:46:21 details people who knew them are all dead now because they were vocal I'm quiet there's only one man who's vocal
00:46:28 and he may be in trouble World Chess Champion Kasparov he has been very outspoken in his attacks on
00:46:35 Putin and I believe he's probably next on the list so clearly your life has been and perhaps continues to be in
00:46:44 danger how do you think about having the views you have the ideas you have being in opposition as you are in this kind of
00:46:53 context when your life could be in danger oh that's the reason I live in New York
00:46:59 so what's they was not my first choice but I knew I had to leave Russia at one point and among other places New York is
00:47:07 the safest is it safe no I mean interested Steve I know what happens what happened what is happening who is
00:47:15 many of Putin enemies but at the end of the day I mean what can I do it it's I I could be very proactive by trying to
00:47:25 change things I can influence but here are way effects I I cannot stop doing what I've been doing for a long time
00:47:33 it's the right thing to do I grew up with my family teaching me sort of the wisdom of Soviet dissidents do what you
00:47:39 must and so be it I could try to be cautious by not traveling to certain places were you
00:47:48 know my security could be at risk there's so many invitations to speak at different locations in the world and I
00:47:56 have to say that many countries are just now are not destinations that I can afford to travel my mother still lives
00:48:03 in Moscow and meet her a few times a year she was devastated when I had to leave Russia because since my father
00:48:13 died in 1971 so she was 33 and she dedicated her entire life to her only son but she recognized in just a year or
00:48:22 so since I left Russia that it was the only chance for me to continue my normal life so just is to I mean to be
00:48:33 relatively safe and to to do what she taught me to do to make the difference do you think you will ever return to
00:48:40 Russia or oh I'm sure when it won't sooner than many people think because I think Putin regime is facing
00:48:46 insurmountable different difficulties and again I read enough historical books suddenly it's just on Sunday dictator
00:49:02 feels comfortable he believes he's popular on Monday morning his bust the good news and bad news I mean the bad
00:49:10 news is that I don't know when and how Putin rule ends the good news he also okay well put let me ask a question that
00:49:26 seems to preoccupy the American mind from the perspective of Russia one did Russia interfere in the 2016 US election government-sanctioned
00:49:39 and future two will rush into fear in the 2020 US election and what does that interference look like
00:49:47 it's very old you know we had such an intelligent conversation and you are healthy but it's it's insulting for my
00:50:02 intellect okay of course they did interfere over horse they did absol everything to elect Trump I mean they
00:50:08 said it many times he this is you know I met enough KGB Colonels in my life to tell you that you know just the way put
00:50:15 it looks at Trump yeah this is the way Luke said I don't have to hear what he says what Trump says it just is I don't
00:50:22 need to go through congressional instigations the way he put it looks at Trump it's the way the KGB officers
00:50:29 looked at the assets it's just and following to 20/20 of course they will do absolutely everything to help Trump
00:50:36 to survive because I think they damage that Trump's relations could cause to America and to the free world it's just
00:50:42 it's beyond one's imagination I think basically from was reelected she'll ruin NATO because he's already heading in
00:50:49 this direction but now he's just he's still limited by the re-election hurdles if he's still in the office after
00:51:05 November 2020 okay January 2021 I don't think about it my problem is not just Trump because Trump is basically it's a
00:51:11 symptom but the problem is that I don't see it just it's the in American political horizon politicians who could
00:51:23 take on Trump for for all damage that he's doing for the free world not just things that that's happened that went
00:51:29 wrong in America so this the it seems to me that the campaign political campaign on the Democratic side is is fixed on
00:51:37 certain important but still second duration guess when you have the foundation the Republican jeopardy I
00:51:44 mean you cannot talk about health care I mean understand how important it is but it's still secondary because the a
00:51:49 framework familiar political life is at risk and you have rather intrusion just you know just it's having the free hands
00:51:58 bye-bye he's by attacking America and other free countries and by doing we have so much evidence about Russia
00:52:05 intervals and brexit in elections in almost every European country and thinking that they will be shy of
00:52:12 attacking America in 2020 now is we strong in the office yeah I think it's yeah it definitely
00:52:20 diminishes the intellectual quality falklands I do what I can last question if you can go back just
00:52:29 look at the entirety of your life you accomplished more than most humans will ever do if you could go back and relive
00:52:37 a single moment in your life what would that moment be there are moments in my life when I think about what could be
00:52:53 done differently but no experience happiness and joy and pride just-just-just is this it's the it's
00:53:01 look I made many mistakes in my life so I just it's there I know that at the end of the day it's I believe in the
00:53:08 butterfly effect so is the it's the I knew moments where I could now if I'm there at that point in 89 in 93 pick up
00:53:21 a year I could improve my actions by not doing this stupid thing but then how do you know that I will have all other
00:53:31 compliments yeah I just I'm I'm afraid that you know we just have to just follow this if you make all wisdom
00:53:37 before is Gumpy know it's the life as this you know it's this it's a box of affair of chocolate and you don't know
00:53:44 what's inside but you have to go one by one so it's the I'm I'm happy with who I am and where I am today and I am very
00:53:51 proud not only with my chess accomplishments but that I made this transition and since I left chess you
00:53:59 know i built my own reputation that had some influence of the game of chess but not it's not you know directly derived
00:54:07 from from the game I'm grateful for my wife so who helped me to build his life we actually married in 2005 it was my sure
00:54:13 marriage that's why I said that make mistakes in my wife but I died by the way I'm close with two kids from my
00:54:19 previous marriages so that's tasty I mean I managed to sort of to balance my life and and hear it I live in New York
00:54:26 so we have our two kids born here in New York it's its new life and it's you know it's it's busy sometimes I wish I could
00:54:34 you know I could limit my engagement in many other things that said I still you know taking time and energy but life is
00:54:47 exciting and as long as I can feel that I've energy I have strengths I have passion to make the difference I'm happy
00:54:58 I think that's a beautiful moment and on Gary spicy buh-bye sure thank you very much for talking to me thank you possible
