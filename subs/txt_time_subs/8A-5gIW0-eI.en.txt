00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Harry Cliff a particle physicist at the University of Cambridge working on the
00:00:09 Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment that specializes in investigating the slight differences between matter and
00:00:16 antimatter by studying a type of particle called the beauty quark or B quark in this way he's part of the group
00:00:23 of physicists who are searching for the evidence of new particles that can answer some of the biggest questions in
00:00:27 modern physics he's also an exceptional communicator of science with some of the clearest and

00:03:55 coolest things that human beings have ever created the Large Hadron Collider ohc what is it how does it work
00:04:05 okay so is essentially this gigantic 27 kilometer circumference particle accelerators this big ring it's buried
00:04:12 100 100 meters underneath the surface in the countryside just outside Geneva in Switzerland and really what it's for
00:04:18 ultimately is to try to understand what are the basic building blocks of the universe so you can think of it in a way
00:04:24 as like a gigantic microscope and and the analogy is actually fairly precise so gigantic microscope effectively
00:04:33 except it's a microscope that looks at the structure of the vacuum in order for this kind of thing to study particles
00:04:43 which are microscopic entities it has to be huge yes gigantic Waxhaw so what do you mean by studying vacuum okay so I
00:04:52 mean so particle physics as a field is kind of badly named in a way because particles are not the fundamental
00:04:58 ingredients of the universe they're not fundamental at all so the things that we believe are the real building blocks of
00:05:04 the universe are objects invisible fluid like objects called quantum fields so these are fields like like the magnetic
00:05:11 field around a magnet that exists everywhere in space they're always there in fact actually it's funny they were in
00:05:16 the wrong institution because this is where the idea of the field was effectively invented by Michael Faraday
00:05:22 doing experiments with magnets and coils of wire so he noticed that you know if he was very famous experiment that he
00:05:29 did where he got a magnet and put it on top of it a piece of paper and then sprinkled iron filings and he found the
00:05:34 iron filings arrange themselves into these kind of loops of which was actually mapping out the invisible
00:05:41 influence of this magnetic field which is a thing you know we've all experienced we're all felt held a magnet
00:05:46 and or two poles the magnet and pushing together and felt this thing this force pushing back so these are real physical
00:05:52 objects and the the way we think of particles in modern physics is that they are essentially little vibrations little
00:05:59 ripples in these otherwise invisible fields that are everywhere they fill the whole universe you know I don't
00:06:06 apologist perhaps for the ridiculous question are you comfortable with the idea of the fundamental nature of our
00:06:14 reality being fields because to me particles you know a bunch of different building blocks makes more sense sort of
00:06:23 intellectually so visually like it's it it seems to I seem to be able to visualize that kind of idea easier yeah
00:06:31 are you comfortable psychologically with the idea that the basic building block is not a block but a field I think it's
00:06:38 I think it's quite a magical idea I find it quite appealing and it's well it comes from a misunderstanding of what
00:06:44 particles are so like when you when we do science at school and we draw a picture of an atom you draw a like you
00:06:49 know nucleus with some protons or neutrons these little spheres in the middle and then you have some electrons
00:06:54 are like little flies flying around the atom and that is a completely misleading picture of what an atom is like it's
00:06:59 nothing like that the electron is not like a little planet orbiting the atom it's this spread out wibbly-wobbly
00:07:06 wave-like thing and we know we've known that since you know the early 20th century thanks to quantum mechanics so
00:07:12 when we carry on using this word particle because sometimes when we do experiments particles do behave like
00:07:18 they're little marbles or little bullets you know so in the LHC when we collide particles together you'll get you know
00:07:24 you'll get like hundreds of particles will fly out through the detector and they all take a trajectory and you can
00:07:29 see from the detector where they've gone and they look like they're little bullets so they behave that way you
00:07:35 know a lot of the time but when you really study them carefully you'll see that they are not little spheres they
00:07:43 are these virial disturbances in in these underlying fields so this is this is really how we think nature is which
00:07:51 is surprising but also I think kind of magic so here we are our bodies are basically made up of like little knots
00:07:59 of energy in these invisible objects that are all around us and what what is the story of the vacuum when it comes to
00:08:09 LHC so what why did you mention the word vacuum okay so if we just if we go back to let us the physics we do know so
00:08:16 atoms are made of electrons which were discovered 100 or so years ago and then nucleus of the atom you have two other
00:08:22 types of particles there's an up something called an up quark and a down quark and those three particles make up
00:08:28 every atom in the universe so we think of these as ripples in fields so there is something called the electron field
00:08:36 and every electron in the universe is a ripple moving about in this electron field the electron field is all around
00:08:41 we can't see it but every electron in our body is a little ripple in this thing that's there all the time and the
00:08:47 quark feels the same so there's an up quark field and an up quark isn't a ripple in the up quark field and the
00:08:51 down quark is a little ripple in something else called the down quark field so these fields are always there
00:08:58 now there are potentially we know about a certain number of fields in what we call the standard model of particle
00:09:02 physics and the most recent one we discovered was the Higgs field and the way we discovered the Higgs field was to
00:09:09 make a little ripple in it so what the LHC did it fired two protons into each other very very hard with enough energy
00:09:17 that you could create a disturbance in this Higgs field and that's what shows up as what we call the Higgs boson so
00:09:22 this particle that everyone was going on about eight or so years ago is proof really the particle in itself is I mean
00:09:29 it's interesting but the things really interesting is the field because it's the the Higgs field that we believe is
00:09:36 the reason that electrons and quarks have mass and it's that invisible field that's always there that gives mass to
00:09:43 the particles the Higgs boson is just our way of checking it's there basically and so the Large Hadron Collider in
00:09:51 order to get that ripple in the Higgs field you it requires a huge amount of energy yes opposes so that's why you need this
00:09:58 huge that's why size matters here so maybe there's a million questions here but let's backtrack why does size matter
00:10:10 in the context of a particle collider so why does bigger allow you for higher energy collisions right so the reason
00:10:18 well it is kind of simple really which is that there are two types of particle accelerator that you can build one is
00:10:23 circular which is like the LHC the other is a great long line so the advantage of a circular machine is that you can send
00:10:31 particles around a ring and you can give them a kick every and they go round so imagine you have a
00:10:34 is actually a bit of the LHC that's about only 30 meters long where you have a bunch of metal boxes which have
00:10:41 oscillating to million volt electric fields inside them which are timed so that when a proton goes through one of
00:10:46 these boxes the field it sees as it approaches is attractive then as it leaves the box it flips and becomes
00:10:52 repulsive and the proton gets attracted then kicked out the other side so it gets a bit faster so you send it but
00:10:56 then you send it back round again and it's incredible like the timing of that the synchronization that wait really
00:11:03 yeah yeah yeah yeah that's I think there's going to be a multiplicative effect on the questions I have is that
00:11:10 okay let me just take that attention for a second how the orchestration of that is that a fundamentally a hardware
00:11:18 problem or software a problem like what how do you get that I mean I might so I should first of all say I'm not an
00:11:24 engineer so the guys I did not build the LHC so they're people much much better at this stuff than I for sure but maybe
00:11:33 but from from your sort of intuition from the the the echoes of what you understand you heard of house design
00:11:41 what's your sense how what's the engineering aspects that the acceleration bit is not challenging okay
00:11:47 okay there is always challenges everything but basically you have these the beams that go around you like see
00:11:54 the beams of particles are divided into little bunches so they're called their bit like swarms of bees if you like and
00:12:00 there are around I think it's something of the order 2000 bunches spaced around the ring and they if you were if you're
00:12:08 a given point on the ring counting bunches you get 40 million bunches passing you every second so they come in
00:12:13 like you know just like cars going past from a very fast motorway so you need to have if you're a electric field that
00:12:19 you're using to accelerate the particles that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives it's got the
00:12:26 right sign to attract them and then flips at the right moment but I think the the voltage in those boxes
00:12:31 oscillates at hundreds of megahertz so the beams at like 40 megahertz but is oscillating much more quickly than the
00:12:36 beam so and I think you know it's difficult engineering but in principle it's not you know a really serious
00:12:42 challenge the bigger problem this probably engineers like screaming at ureña probably yeah what
00:12:47 okay so in terms of coming back to this thing why is it so big well the reason is you wanna get the particles through
00:12:53 that accelerating element over over again so you want to bring them back round that's why it's round the question
00:12:58 is why couldn't you make it smaller well the basic answer is that these particles are going unbelievably quickly so they
00:13:09 travel at 99.999999 1% of the speed of light in the LHC and if you think about say driving your car round a corner high
00:13:17 speed if you go fast you need a very you need a lot of friction in the tires to make sure you don't slide off the road
00:13:24 so the the limiting factor is the how powerful a magnet can you make because it's what we do is magnets are used to
00:13:30 bend the particles around the ring and essentially the LHC when it was designed was designed with the most powerful
00:13:36 magnets that could conceivably be built at the time and so that's your kind of limiting factors if you wanted to make
00:13:42 the machines smaller that means a tighter bend you need to have a more powerful magnet so it's this toss-up
00:13:48 between how strong your magnets versus how big a tunnel can you afford the bigger the tunnel the weaker the magnets
00:13:52 can be the smaller a tunnel the stronger they've got to be okay so maybe can we backtrack to the data model and say what
00:14:01 kind of particles there are period and maybe the history of kind of assembling that the standard model of physics and
00:14:09 then how that leads up to the hopes and dreams and the accomplishments of the Large Hadron Collider yeah sure okay so
00:14:15 for all the 20th century physics in like five minutes yeah please okay so okay the story
00:14:21 really begins properly end of the 19th century the basic view of matter is that matter is made of atoms and the atoms
00:14:29 are indestructible immutable little spheres like the things we were talking about they don't really exist and
00:14:34 there's you know one atom for every chemical element as an atom for hydrogen for helium for carbon photon etc and
00:14:39 they're all different then in 1897 experiments done at the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge where
00:14:46 I am still where I'm based showed that there are actually smaller particles inside the atom which eventually became
00:14:51 known as electrons these are these negatively charged things that go around the outside a few years later and it's
00:14:59 Rutherford very famous nuclear physics nuclear physics shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center which we
00:15:05 call the nucleus which is a positively charged object so then by in light 1910-11 we have this model of the atom
00:15:10 that we learn in school which is you've got a nucleus electrons go round there fast forward you know a few years the
00:15:17 nucleus people start doing experiments with radioactivity where they use alpha particles that are spat out of
00:15:24 radioactive elements as as bullets and they fire them other atoms and by banging things into each other they see
00:15:30 that they can knock bits out of the nucleus so these things come out called protons first of all which are
00:15:36 positively charged particles about 2,000 times heavier than the electron and then 10 years later more or less neutral
00:15:42 particle is discovered called the neutron so those are the three basic building blocks of atoms you have
00:15:49 protons and neutrons in the nucleus that are stuck together by something called a strong force the strong nuclear force
00:15:54 and you have electrons in orbit around that held in by the electromagnetic force which is one of the you know the
00:16:01 forces of nature that's sort of where we get to by late 1932 more or less then what happens is physics is nice and neat
00:16:09 in 1932 everything looks great got three particles and all the atoms are made of that's fine but then cloud chamber
00:16:15 experiments these are devices that can be used to the first devices capable of imaging subatomic particles so you can
00:16:20 see their tracks and they use to study cosmic rays particles that come from outer space and bang into the atmosphere
00:16:28 and in these experiments people start to see a whole load of new particles so they discover for one thing antimatter
00:16:33 which is a sort of a mirror image of the particles so we discovered that there's also as well as a negatively charged
00:16:37 electron there's something called a positron which is a positively charged version of the electron and there's an
00:16:42 antiproton which is negatively charged and and then a whole load of other weird particle start to get discovered and no
00:16:49 one really knows what they are this is known as the zoo of particles are these discoveries fundamentally first
00:16:55 theoretical discoveries or the discoveries in an experiment so like well yeah what was the process of
00:17:03 discovery for these early it's a mixture I mean that the early stuff around the atom is really experimentally driven
00:17:09 it's not based on some theory it's exploration in the lab using equipment so it's really people just figuring out
00:17:14 hands-on with the fenomena figuring out what these things are the theory comes a bit later that there is that's not
00:17:20 always the case so in the discovery of the anti-electron the positron that was predicted from quantum mechanics and
00:17:28 relativity by a very clever theoretical physicist called Paul Dirac who was probably the second brightest you know
00:17:34 physicist of the 20th century apart from Einstein but isn't as well anywhere near as well known so he predicted the
00:17:39 existence of the anti electron from basically a combination of the theories of quantum mechanics and relativity and
00:17:44 it was discovered about a year after he made their prediction what happens when an electron meets a positron they
00:17:52 annihilate each other so if you when you bring a particle in its antiparticle together they they react well they react
00:17:57 they just wipe each other out and they turn their mass is turned into energy usually in the form of photons so you'll
00:18:06 get light produced so when you have that kind of situation why why does the universe exists at all if there's matter
00:18:11 in any matter oh god now we're getting into the really big questions so you want to go there now
00:18:17 yeah that's me maybe let's go there later that's because I mean that is a very big question yeah let's let's take
00:18:24 it slow with the standard model so okay so there's matter and antimatter in the 30s mmm
00:18:30 so what else so matter antimatter and then a load of new particles start turning up in these cosmic ray
00:18:37 experiments first of all and they don't seem to be particles that make up atoms there's something else they all mostly
00:18:44 interact with a strong nuclear force so they're a bit like protons and neutrons and by in the 1960s in America
00:18:51 particularly but also in Europe and Russia scientist article particle accelerators so these are the
00:18:56 forerunners of the LHC so big ring shaped machines that were you know hundreds of meters long which in those
00:19:01 days was enormous you never you know most physics up until that point had been done in labs in universities you
00:19:06 know with small bits of kit so this is a big change and when these accelerators are built they start to find they can
00:19:12 produce even more of these particles so I don't know the exact numbers but by around 1960 there are of order a hundred
00:19:19 of these things that have been discovered and physicists are kind of tearing the hair out because physics is
00:19:25 all about simplification and suddenly what was simple as come messy and complicated and everyone
00:19:30 sort of wants to understand what's going on it's a quick kind of a side and the probably really dumb question but how is
00:19:38 it possible to take something like a like a photon or electron and be able to control it enough like to be able to do
00:19:49 a controlled experiment where you collide it against something else yeah is that is that that seems like an
00:19:57 exceptionally difficult engineering challenge because you mention vacuum to so you basically want to remove every
00:20:04 other distraction and really focus on this collision how difficult of an engineering challenge is that just to
00:20:10 get a sense and it's very hard I mean in the early days particularly when the first accelerators are being built in
00:20:17 like 1932 Ernest Lawrence builds the first what we call the cyclotron which is like a little celery - this big or so
00:20:22 there's another widely they're big there's a tiny little thing yeah I mean so most of the first accelerators were
00:20:31 what we call fixed argot experiments so you had a ring you accelerate particles around the ring and then you fire them
00:20:38 out the side into some target so is eat that makes the kind of the colliding bit is relatively straightforward to use
00:20:43 fire it whatever it is you want to fire it out the hard bit is the steering the beams with the magnetic fields getting
00:20:48 you know strong enough electric fields to accelerate them all that kind of stuff the first colliders where you have two
00:20:56 beams colliding head-on that comes later and I don't think it's done until maybe the 1980s
00:21:04 I'm not entirely sure but it takes is much harder problem that's crazy because yet it's like perfectly you had them to
00:21:10 hit each other I mean we're talking about I mean what scale it takes what's this this I mean the temporal thing is a
00:21:20 giant mess but the spatially like the size mmm it's tiny well to give you a sense so the LHC beams the
00:21:29 cross-sectional diameter is I think around a dozen or so microns so you know ten ten millionths of a meters then a
00:21:40 beam sorry just to clarify a beam how many is it the bunches that you mentioned yes multiple poles is just one
00:21:46 part oh no no the bunches contained say a hundred billion protons each so a bunch is not really one shape they're
00:21:52 actually quite long they're like 30 centimeters long but thinner than a human hair so like very very narrow long
00:21:58 sort of object so those are the things so what happens in the LHC is you steer the beams so that they cross in the
00:22:07 middle of the detector so the basically have these swarms of protons are flying through each other and most of that you
00:22:12 have so you have 100 billion coming one way 100 billion another way maybe 10 of them will hit each other okay so this
00:22:19 okay that makes a lot more sense that's nice so there you're trying to use sort of it's like probabilistically you're
00:22:25 not you can't make a single particle collide with a single oh yeah so that's not an efficient way to do it you'd be
00:22:30 waiting a very long time to get anything yeah so you you're basically right see you're relying on probability to be that
00:22:38 some fraction of them are gonna collide yeah and then you know which is it's it's a it's a swarm of the same kind of
00:22:45 particle so it doesn't matter which ones each other exactly I mean that that's not to say it's not hard you've got a
00:22:50 one of the challenges to make the collisions work is you have to squash these beams to very very the basic their
00:22:56 narrower they are the better because the higher the chances of them colliding if you think about two flocks of birds
00:23:01 flying through each other the birds are all far apart in the flocks there's not much chance that
00:23:05 they'll collide if they're all flying densely together and they very much more likely to collide with each other so
00:23:11 that's the sort of problem it's tuning those magnetic fields getting them angry feels powerful not that you squash the
00:23:15 beams and focus them so that you get enough collisions that's super cool do you know how much software is involved
00:23:21 here I mean it's sort of I come in the software world and it's fascinating this seems like it's a software is buggy and
00:23:30 messy and so like you almost don't want to rely on software too much like if you do it has to be like low-level like
00:23:36 Fortran style programming do you know how much software isn't a Large Hadron Collider I mean it depends at which
00:23:42 level a lot I mean the whole thing is obviously computer-controlled so I mean I I don't know a huge amount about how
00:23:48 the software for the actual accelerator works but you know I've been in the control center so has CERN there's this
00:23:54 big control room which is like bit like a NASA mission control with big banks of you know desk where the engine
00:23:59 is sit and they monitor the LHC because you obviously can't be in the tunnel when it's running so everything's remote
00:24:06 I mean one sort of anecdote about the sort of software side in 2008 when the LHC first switched on they had this big
00:24:13 launch event and then you know big press conference party to inaugurate the machine and about ten days after that
00:24:20 they were doing some tests and the this dramatic event happened where a huge explosion basically took place in a
00:24:26 tunnel that destroyed were damaged badly damaged about about half a kilometer of the machine but the story is viewed the
00:24:32 engineers here in the control room that day they'd one guy told me the story about you know basically there's all
00:24:37 these screens they have in the control room started going red so these alarms like you know kind of in software going
00:24:43 off and then they assume that lists all wrong with the software cuz there's no way something this catastrophic could
00:24:49 have could have happened yeah but I mean when I worked on one when I was a PhD student one of my Jobs was to help to
00:24:56 maintain the software that's used to control the detector that we work on and that was it's relatively robust not so
00:25:02 you don't want it to be too fancy you don't want to sort of fall over too easily the more clever stuff comes when
00:25:08 you're talking about analyzing the data and that's where they're sort of you know are we jumping around too much do
00:25:13 we finish for the standard model we didn't know we didn't hurry and start talking mark works we haven't talked
00:25:19 about me yet got to the messy zoo of particles go back there if it's okay okay that's take us the rest of the
00:25:27 history of physics in the 20th century okay sure okay so circa 1960 you have this you
00:25:33 have these hundred or so particles it's a bit like the periodic table all over again so you've got like like having a
00:25:38 hundred elements sort of a bit like that and people try to start to try to impose some order so Murray Gelman he's a
00:25:46 theoretical physicist American from New York he realizes that there are these symmetries in these particles that if
00:25:53 you arrange them in certain ways that they relate to each other and he uses these symmetry principles to predict the
00:25:58 existence of particles that haven't been discovered which are then discovered in accelerators so this starts to suggest
00:26:04 there's not just random collections of crap there's like you know actually some order to this under
00:26:11 a little bit later in 1960 again it's round the 1960s he proposes along with another physicist called George Zweig
00:26:21 the these symmetries arise because just like the patterns in the periodic table arise because atoms are made of
00:26:26 electrons and protons that these patterns are due to the fact that these particles are made of smaller things and
00:26:32 they are called quarks so these are the particles they're predicted from theory for a long time no one really believes
00:26:37 they're real a lot of people think that there are kind of theoretical convenience that happen to fit the data
00:26:42 but there's no evidence no one's ever seen a quark in any experiment and lots of experiments are done to try to find
00:26:50 quarks just try to knock a quark out of her so the idea if protons and neutrons say made of quarks you should work to
00:26:55 knock a quark out and see the quark that never happens and we still have never actually managed to do that really no so
00:27:01 the way but the way that it's done in the end is this machine that's built in California at Stanford lab Stanford
00:27:09 Linear Accelerator which is essentially a gigantic three kilometer long electron gun fires electrons almost speed of
00:27:17 light at protons and when you do these experiments what you find is a very high energy the electrons bounce off small
00:27:25 hard objects inside the proton so it's a bit like taking an x-ray of the proton you're firing these very light
00:27:31 high-energy particles and they're pinging off little things inside the proton that are like ball bearings if
00:27:38 you like so you actually that way they resolve that there are three things inside the proton which are quarks the
00:27:44 quarks that governance why I could predicted so that's really the evidence that convinces people that these things
00:27:50 are real the fact that we've never seen one in an experiment directly they're always stuck inside other particles and
00:27:58 the reason for that is essentially to do with the strong force the strong forces the force holds quarks together and it's
00:28:04 so strongly it's impossible to actually liberate a quark so if you try and pull a quark out of a proton what actually
00:28:11 ends up happening is that the you kind of create this that this spring-like bond in the strong force we've imagined
00:28:16 two quarks that are held together by very powerful spring you pull it pull and pull more and more energy gets
00:28:21 stored in there bond like stretching a spring and eventually the tension gets so great the
00:28:28 spring snaps and the energy in that bond gets turned into two new quarks that go on the broken ends so you started with
00:28:34 two quarks to end up with four quarks so you never actually get to take a quark out you just end up making loads
00:28:40 of more quarks in the process so how do we again forgive the dumb question how do we know quarks are real then well eh
00:28:47 from these experiments where we can scatter you fire electrons into the protons they can burrow into the proton
00:28:53 and knock off and they can bounce off these quarks so you can see from the angles the electrons come Alice you can
00:29:00 infer you can infer that these things are there the quark model can also be used it has a lot of successes you can
00:29:06 use it to predict the existence of new particles that hadn't been seen so and basically there's lots of data basically
00:29:12 showing from you know when we fire protons at each other at the LHC a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place
00:29:20 and every time they try and escape from say one of their protons they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off
00:29:26 it has bound up in other sorts of particles made of quarks so they're all the sort of the theoretical predictions
00:29:32 from the basic theory of the strong force and the quarks all agrees with what we are seeing experiments we've
00:29:37 just never seen a an actual quark on its own because unfortunate it's impossible to get them out on their own
00:29:44 so quarks these crazy smaller things that are hard to imagine a real so what else what else is part of the story here
00:29:51 so the other thing that's going on at the time around the sixties it's an attempt to understand the forces that
00:29:59 make these particles interact with each other so you have the electromagnetic force which is the force that was sort
00:30:04 of discovered to some extent in this room or at least in this building so the first what we call quantum field theory
00:30:12 of the electromagnetic force is developed in the 1940s and 50s by Fineman Richard Feynman amongst other
00:30:22 people julian schwinger tominaga who come up with the first what we call a quantum field theory of the
00:30:26 electromagnetic force and this is where this description of which I gave you at the beginning that particles are ripples
00:30:32 and fields well in this theory the photon the particle of light is described as
00:30:36 people in this quantum field called the electromagnetic field and the attempt then is made to try what can we come up
00:30:42 with a quantum field theory of the other forces of the strong force and the weak the other third the third force which we
00:30:47 haven't discussed which is the weak force which is a nuclear force we don't really experience it in our everyday
00:30:53 lives but it's responsible for radioactive decay is the force that allows you know in a radioactive atom to
00:31:00 turn into a different element for example and there are a few we've explicitly mentioned but so there's
00:31:07 technically four forces yes I guess three of them were being in in the standard model like the weak there's the
00:31:13 strong and the electromagnetic and then there's gravity in this gravity which we don't worry about that because maybe
00:31:19 maybe we bring that up at the end yeah gravity so far we don't have a quantum theory of and if you can solve that
00:31:25 problem you win a Nobel Prize well we're gonna have to bring up the graviton at some point I'm gonna ask you but let's
00:31:31 let's leave that to the side for now so those three okay fine man a electromagnetic force the the quantum
00:31:41 field yeah where does the weak force come in so so yeah well first of I mean the strong force a bit easiest the
00:31:46 strong force is a little bit like the electromagnetic force it's a force that binds things together so that's the
00:31:51 force that holds quarks together inside the proton for example so a quantum field theory of that force is discovered
00:32:00 in I think it's in the sixties and it predicts the existence of new force particles called gluons so gluons are a
00:32:07 bit like the photon the photon is the particle of electromagnetism gluons are the the particles of the strong force
00:32:14 and so there's there's just like there's an electromagnetic field there's something called a gluon field which is
00:32:20 also all around us but these part there's some of these particles I guess the force carriers or whatever they
00:32:25 carry that well it depends how you want to think about it I mean really the field the strong force field the gluon
00:32:31 field is the thing that binds the quarks together the gluons are the little ripples in that field so that like in
00:32:37 the same way that the photon is a ripple in there in the electromagnetic field but the thing that really does the
00:32:44 binding is the field I mean you may have heard people talk about things like verge as you've heard the phrase virtual particle
00:32:51 so sometimes in some if you hear people describing how forces are exchanged between particles they quite often talk
00:32:56 about the idea that you know if you have an electron and another electron say and they're repelling each other through the
00:33:03 electro bratok electromagnetic force you can think of that as if they're exchanging photons so they're kind of
00:33:07 firing photons backwards and forwards between each other and that causes them to repel therefore time is then a
00:33:13 virtual particle yes that's what we call a virtual particle in other words it's not a real thing doesn't actually exist
00:33:18 so it's an artifact of the way theorists do calculations so when they do calculations in quantum field theory
00:33:24 rather than there's no one's discovered a way of just treating the whole field you have to break the field down into
00:33:29 simpler things so you can basically treat the field as if it's made up of lots of these virtual photons but
00:33:35 there's no experiment that you can do that couldn't detect these particles being exchanged what's really happening
00:33:41 in reality is the electromagnetic field is warped by the charge of the electron and that causes the force but the way we
00:33:49 do calculations involves parties let's say it's a bit confusing but it is really a mathematical technique it's not
00:33:55 something that corresponds to reality I mean that's part I guess of the fireman diagrams yes is this virtual product
00:34:01 okay that's right yeah some of these have mass some of them don't mm-hmm is that is that what what does that even
00:34:09 mean not to have mass and maybe you can say well which one of them's have mass or which don't okay so and why is mass
00:34:17 important or relevant in this cupboard in this in this field view of the universe well there are only two particles in the
00:34:24 standard model that don't have mass which are the photon and the gluons so they are massless particles but the
00:34:33 electron the quarks and they're a bunch of other particles I haven't discussed there's something called a muon and a
00:34:38 Tau which are basically heavy versions of the electron that are unstable you can make them in accelerators but they
00:34:44 don't form atoms or anything they don't exist for long enough but all the matter particles there are twelve of them six
00:34:51 quarks and six what we call leptons which includes the electron and it's too heavy versions and three neutrinos all
00:34:58 of them have mass and so do this is the critical bit so the weak force which is the third of these
00:35:04 quantum forces which is one of the hardest to understand the force particles of that force have very large
00:35:14 masses and there are three of them they're called the W plus the W minus and the Z boson and they have masses of
00:35:23 between 80 and 90 times that of the the protons they're very heavy learn wow they're very heavy things they're what
00:35:29 the heaviest I guess they're not the heaviest the heaviest particle is the top quark which has a mass of about 175
00:35:39 ish protons so that's really massive we don't know why is so massive but they're coming back to the weak force so that
00:35:45 the the problem in the 60s and 70s was that the reason that the electromagnetic force is a force that we can experience
00:35:52 our everyday live so if we have a magnet and a piece of metal you can hold it you know a meter apart if it's powerful
00:35:57 laughs and you'll feel a force whereas the weak force only is becomes apparent when you basically have two particles
00:36:05 touching at the scale of a nucleus so if you get two very short distances before this force becomes manifest it's not
00:36:11 doesn't we don't get weak forces going on in this room they don't notice them and the reason for that is that the
00:36:18 particle well the the field that transmits the weak force the particle that's associated with that field has a
00:36:24 very large mass which means that the field dies off very quickly says you whereas an electric charge if you were
00:36:30 to look at the shape of the electric field it would fall off with this you know this one called the inverse square
00:36:34 law which is the idea that the force halves every time you double the distance no sorry it doesn't have it
00:36:41 quarters every time you see every time you double the distance between say the two particles whereas the weak force
00:36:46 kind of you move a little bit away from the nucleus and just disappears the reason for that is because these these
00:36:53 fields the particles that go with them have a very large mass but the problem that was that theorists faced in the
00:37:00 sixties was that if you tried to introduce massive force fields the theory who gave you nonsensical answers
00:37:08 so you'd end up with infinite results for a lot of the calculations you tried to do so the basically it turned it
00:37:13 seemed that quantum field theory was incompatible with having massive articles not just the force particles
00:37:20 actually but even the electron was a problem so this is where the Higgs that we sort of alluded to comes in and the
00:37:28 solution was to say okay well actually all the particles in the standard model of mass they have no mass so the quarks
00:37:32 the electron they don't have a mass neither do these weak particles they don't have mass either what happens is
00:37:38 they actually acquire mass through another process they get it from somewhere else they don't actually have
00:37:45 it intrinsically so this idea that was introduced by what Peter Higgs is the most famous but actually they're about
00:37:50 six people that come up with the idea more or less at the same time is that you introduce a new quantum field which
00:37:56 is another one of these invisible things as everywhere and it's through the interaction with this field that
00:38:03 particles get mass so you can think of say an electron in the Higgs field it kind of Higgs field kind of bunches
00:38:11 around the electron it sort of a drawn towards the electron and that energy that's stored in that field around the
00:38:18 electron is what we see as the mass of the electron but if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field then all the
00:38:23 particles in nature would become massless and fly around at the speed of light so this this idea of the Higgs
00:38:32 field allowed other people other theorists to come up with a well it was another a unit basically a unified
00:38:40 theory of the electromagnetic force on the weak force so once you bring in the Higgs field you can combine two of the
00:38:46 forces into one so it turns out the electromagnetic force and the weak force are just two aspects of the same
00:38:53 fundamental force and at the LHC we go to high enough energies that you see these two forces unifying effectively so
00:39:03 that so first of all it started as a theoretical notion like this is just something and then I mean wasn't the
00:39:10 Higgs called the god particle at some point it was by a guy trying to sell popular science books yeah yeah but by
00:39:17 me I am because when I was hearing it I thought it would I mean that would solve a lot of the you know file a lot of our
00:39:25 ideas of physics was Molloy's my notion but maybe you can speak to that was is as big of a leap is it as a god particle
00:39:37 is it a Jesus particle which which you know what's the big contribution of Higgs in terms of this unification power
00:39:43 yeah I mean to understand that I maybe helps know the history a little bit so when the what we call electroweak theory
00:39:49 was put together which is where you unify electromagnetism with the weak force and the Higgs is involved in all
00:39:54 of that so that theory which was written in the mid-70s predicted the existence of four new particles the w+ boson the
00:40:03 w- boson the z boson and the Higgs boson so there were these four particles that came with the theory that were predicted
00:40:09 by the theory in 1983-84 the W's and the z particles were discovered an accelerator at CERN called
00:40:16 the super proton synchrotron which was a seven kilometer particle collider so three of the bits of this theory had
00:40:23 already been found so people are pretty confident from the 80s that the Higgs must exist because it was a part of this
00:40:31 family of particles that this theoretical structure only works if the Higgs is there so what then happens this
00:40:38 question right why is the LHC the size it is yes well actually the tunnel that the LHC is in was not built for the LHC
00:40:44 it was built from for a previous accelerator called the large electron positron Collider so that that was bit
00:40:52 began operation in the late 80s early 90s they basically did that's when they dug the 27 kilometer tunnel they put as
00:40:59 accelerator into it the collider defiers electrons and anti electrons at each other electrons and positrons so the
00:41:05 purpose of that machine was well it was actually to look for the Higgs that was one of the things it was trying to do it
00:41:09 didn't man I didn't have enough energy to do it in the end but the main thing it was it studied the W and the Z
00:41:17 particles at very high precision so it made loads of these things previously can you make a few of them at the
00:41:22 previous accelerator you could study these really really precisely and by studying their properties you could
00:41:28 really test this electroweak theory that had been invented in the seventies and really make sure that it worked so
00:41:35 actually by 1999 when this machine turned off people knew well okay you never know until you until you find the
00:41:43 thing but people were really confident electroweak theory was right and that the Higgs almost the Higgs or something
00:41:49 very like the Higgs had to exist because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work it'd be really weird if you could
00:41:55 discover and these particles they all behave exactly just theory tells you they should but somehow this key piece
00:42:01 of the picture isn't it's not there so in a way it depends how you look at it the discovery of the Higgs on its own is
00:42:09 it's also a huge achievement in many both experimenting and theoretically on the other hand it's this it's like
00:42:16 having a jigsaw puzzle where every piece has been filled in you've this beautiful image there's one gap and you kind of
00:42:21 know that that piece must be there something right so yeah so the discovery in itself although it's important is not
00:42:31 so interesting it's a good confirmation of the obvious yes at that point but what makes it interesting is not that it
00:42:38 just completes the standard model which is a theory that we've known had the basic layout offs for 40 years or more
00:42:47 now it's that the Higgs actually is a is a unique particle is very different to any of the other particles in the
00:42:53 standard model and it's a theoretically very troublesome particle there are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs
00:43:01 but also opportunities so that we basically don't really understand how such an object can exist in the form
00:43:07 that it does so there are lots of reasons for thinking that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles or
00:43:14 that it's perhaps made of other things so it's not a fundamental particle that it's made of smaller things I can talk
00:43:19 about that if you like a bit that's that's still an ocean so yeah so the Higgs might not be a fundamental
00:43:26 particle there may be some in my oh man so that that is an idea it's not you know it's not been demonstrated to be
00:43:32 true but I mean there's all of these ideas basically come from the fact that it's a this is this is a problem
00:43:39 motivated a lot of development in physics in the last 30 years or so and there's this basic fact that the higgs
00:43:45 field which is this field that's everywhere in the universe this is the thing that gives mass to the particles
00:43:50 and the Higgs field is different from ever all the other fields in that let's say you take the electromagnetic field
00:43:55 which is you know if we actually were to measure the electromagnetic field we would measure all kinds of stuff
00:43:59 going on because there's light there's gonna be microwaves and radio waves and stuff but let's say we could go to a
00:44:05 really really remote part of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it and then measure the electromagnetic
00:44:10 field in that box the field would be almost zero apart from some little quantum fluctuations but basically it
00:44:17 goes to naught the Higgs field has a value everywhere so it's a bit like the hole it's like the entire of space has
00:44:24 got this energy stored in the Higgs field which is not zero it's it's finite it's got some it's a bit like having the
00:44:30 the temperature of space raised to you know some background temperature and it's that energy that gives mass to the
00:44:37 particles so the reason that electrons and quarks have mass is through the interaction with this energy that's
00:44:46 stored in the Higgs field now it turns out that the precise value this energy has has to be very carefully tuned if
00:44:56 you want a universe where interesting stuff can happen so if you push the higgs field down it has a tendency to
00:45:04 collapse to what there's a tenon if you do you're sort of naive calculations they're basically two possible likely
00:45:08 configurations for the Higgs field which is either it's zero everywhere in which case you have a universe which is just
00:45:15 particles with no mass that can't form atoms and just fly by at the speed of light or it explodes to an enormous
00:45:21 value what we call the Planck scale which is the scale of quantum gravity and at that point if the Hicksville was
00:45:27 that strong even an electron would become so massive that it would collapse into a black hole and then you have a
00:45:33 universe made of black holes and nothing like us so it seems that the the strength of the Higgs field is - it
00:45:40 could achieve the value that we see requires what we call fine-tuning of the laws of physics you have to fiddle
00:45:45 around with the other fields in the standard model and their properties to just get it to this right sort of
00:45:51 Goldilocks value that allows atoms to exist this is deeply fishy people really dislike this well yeah I guess well so
00:46:00 what would be a so - two explanations one there's a god the design this perfectly and two is there's an infinite
00:46:07 number of alternate universes and we'll just happen to being the one in which life is possible
00:46:13 yeah complexity so when you say I mean life any kind of complexity that's not either complete chaos or black holes
00:46:22 yeah yeah I mean how does that make you feel what do you make that has such a fascinating notion that this perfectly
00:46:29 tuned field that's the same everywhere yeah is there what do you make of that yeah well you make of that I mean yeah
00:46:35 you like that two of the possible explanations yeah I mean well someone you know some cosmic creator way yeah
00:46:43 let's fix that to be at the right level that's more possibility I guess it's not a scientifically test for one but you
00:46:48 know theoretically I guess it's possible sorry to interrupt but there could also be not a designer but could never be
00:46:55 just I guess I'm not sure what that that some kind of mechanism by which this this this kind of field is enforced
00:47:11 in order to create complexity basic basically forces that pull the universe towards an interesting complexity I mean
00:47:22 yeah I mean I has those ideas I don't really subscribe to them as I'm saying it sounds really stupid no I mean yeah
00:47:27 and there are definitely people that make those kind of arguments you know there's ideas that I think it's Lise
00:47:35 Mullins idea one I think that you know universes are born inside black holes and so universe is that behaved like
00:47:42 Darwinian evolution of the universe where universes give birth to other universes and they've universes where
00:47:47 black holes can form are more likely to give birth to more universes so you end up with universes which have similar
00:47:52 laws I mean I don't whatever but why I talked to dr. Lee recently understand this podcast and he's he's a reminder to
00:48:02 me that the physics community has like so many interesting characters yeah it's fascinating yeah anyway so so I mean as
00:48:09 an experimentalist I tend to sort of think these are interesting ideas but they're not really testable so I tend
00:48:14 not to think about very much so I mean going back to the science of this there wasn't that there is an
00:48:19 explanation there is a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs which doesn't involve multiverses or creators fiddling
00:48:27 about were the laws of physics if the most popular solution was something called supersymmetry which is a theory
00:48:34 which is involves a new type of symmetry of the universe in fact it's one of the last types of symmetries that is
00:48:39 possible to have that we haven't already seen in nature which is a symmetry between force particles and matter
00:48:46 particles so what we call fermions which held before the matter particles and bosons which were force particles and if
00:48:51 you have supersymmetry then there is a superpartner for every particle in the standard model and the without going to
00:48:58 the details the effect of this basically is that you have a whole bunch of other fields and these fields cancel out the
00:49:05 effect of the standard model fields and they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice sensible value so in supersymmetry you
00:49:12 naturally without any concurring about with the constants of nature or anything you get a Higgs field with a nice value
00:49:19 which is the one we see so this is one of the written supersymmetry has also got lots of other things going for it it
00:49:24 predicts the existence of a dark matter particle which would be great it you know it potentially in suggests that the
00:49:30 the strong force and the electroweak force unify high energy so lots of reasons people thought this was a
00:49:36 productive idea and when the LHC was just before it was turned on there was a lot of hype I guess a lot of an
00:49:42 expectation that we would discover these super partners because and particularly the main reason was that if if
00:49:49 supersymmetry stabilizes the higgs field at this nice Goldilocks value these super particles should have a mass
00:49:57 around the energy that we're probing at the LHC around the energy of the Higgs so it was kind of thought you discovered
00:50:02 the Higgs you probably discover superpartners so once you start creating ripples in this fix field you should be
00:50:09 able to see these kinds of you should be yeah super fields would be there but I said well at the very beginning I said
00:50:14 we're probing the vacuum what I mean is really that you know okay let's say these super fields exist the vacuum
00:50:18 contains super fields they're they're these super symmetric fields if we hit them hard enough we can make them
00:50:24 vibrate we see super particles come flying out that's the sort of that's the idea the hope ok that's the whole alone
00:50:32 but we haven't but we haven't so so far at least I mean we've had now a decade of data taking at the LHC
00:50:41 no signs of superpartners have supersymmetric particles have been found in fact no signs of any physics any new
00:50:46 particles beyond the standard model have been found so supersymmetry is not the only thing that can do this there are
00:50:51 other theories that involve additional dimensions of space or potentially involve the Higgs boson being made of
00:50:57 smaller things being made of other particles that's an interesting you know I haven't heard that before that's
00:51:02 really that's an issue but could you maybe linger on that like what what could be what could Higgs particle be
00:51:10 made of well so the the oldest I think the original ideas about this was these theories called Technicolor which were
00:51:16 basically like an analogy with the strong force so the idea was the Higgs boson was a bound state of two very
00:51:24 strongly interacting particles that were a bit like quarks so like quarks but I guess higher energy things with a super
00:51:31 strong force so not the strong force but a new force that was very strong and the Higgs was a bound state of these these
00:51:37 objects and the Higgs wouldn't principle if that was right would be the first in a series of Technicolor particles
00:51:45 Technicolor I think not being a theorist but it's not biz basically not done very well there's particularly since the LHC
00:51:51 found the Higgs that kind of it rules out you know a lot of these Technicolor theories but there are other things that
00:51:56 are a bit like Technicolor so there's a theory called partial composite nurse which is an idea that some of my
00:52:03 colleagues that Cambridge have worked on which is a similar sort of idea that the Higgs is a bound state of some strongly
00:52:10 interacting particles and that the standard model particles themselves the more exotic ones like the top quark are
00:52:18 also sort of mixtures of these composite particles so it's a kind of an extension to the standard model which explains
00:52:26 this problem with the Higgs bosons Goldilocks value but also helps us understand we have we're in a situation
00:52:34 now again a bit like the periodic table where we have six quarks six leptons in this kind of you can range in this nice
00:52:40 table and there you can see these columns where the patterns repeat and you go okay maybe there's something
00:52:47 deeper going on here is that you know and and so this would potentially be something this partial composite NOS
00:52:51 theory could Lane sort of enlarged this picture that allows us to see the whole symmetrical
00:52:57 pattern and understand what the ingredients why do we have wind so one of the big questions in particle physics
00:53:04 is why are there three copies of the matter particles so in what we call the first generation which is what we're
00:53:10 made of there's the electron the electron neutrino the up quark on the down quark they're the most common
00:53:15 matter particles in the universe but then there are copies of these four particles in the second and the third
00:53:21 generations so things like muons and top quarks and other stuff we don't know why we see these patterns we have no idea
00:53:27 where it comes from so that's another big question you know can we find out the deeper order that explains this
00:53:35 particular tape period table of particles that we see is it possible that the the deeper order includes like
00:53:43 almost a single entity so like something that I guess like string theory dreams about is this is this part is this
00:53:50 essentially the dream is to discover something simple beautiful and unifying yeah I mean that is the dream and it I
00:53:59 think for some people for a lot of people it still is the dream so there's a great book by Steven Weinberg who is
00:54:05 one of the theoretical physicists who was instrumental in building the standard model so he came up with some
00:54:12 others with the electroweak theory the theory that unified electromagnetism and the weak force and here at this book I
00:54:17 think it was towards the end of the 80s early 90s called dreams of a final theory which is a very lovely quite
00:54:25 short book about this idea of a final unifying theory that brings everything together and I think you get a sense
00:54:30 reading his book written at the end of 80s and early 90s that there was this feeling that such a theory was coming
00:54:39 and that was the time when string theory had been was was very exciting so string theory there's been this thing called
00:54:44 the superstring revolution and theoretical physical very excited they discovered these theoretical objects
00:54:49 these little vibrating loops of string that in principle not only was a quantum theory of gravity but could explain all
00:54:54 the particles in the standard model and bring it all together and you as you say you have one object the string and you
00:55:02 can pluck it and the way it vibrates gives you these different notes each of which is a different part
00:55:09 so it's a very lovely idea but the problem is that well there's a there's a few people discover their mathematics is
00:55:15 very difficult so people have spent three decades and more trying to understand string theory and I think you
00:55:21 know if you spoke to most string theorists they would probably freely admit that no one really knows what
00:55:25 string theory is yet I mean there's been a lot of work but it's not really understood and the other problem is that
00:55:31 string theory mostly makes predictions about physics that occurs energies far beyond what we will ever be able to
00:55:41 probe in the laboratory yeah probably ever by the way so sorry they take a million tangents but is there room for
00:55:49 complete innovation of how to build a particle collider that could give us an order of magnitude increase in any kind
00:55:56 of energies or do we need to keep just increasing the size of thing I mean maybe yeah I mean there are ideas
00:56:02 but to give you a sense of the Gulf that has to be bridged so the LHC collides particles at an
00:56:12 energy of what we call fourteen terror electron volts so that's basically equivalent of you accelerated a proton
00:56:19 through 14 trillion volts that gets us to the energies where the Higgs and these weak particles live they're very
00:56:25 massive the the scale where strings become manifest is something called the Planck scale which i think is of the
00:56:33 order 10 to the hang on again that's right is 10 to the 18 Giga electron volt so about 10 to the 15 terror electron
00:56:42 volts so you're talking you know trillions of times more energy more the 10 to the 15 the 10 to the 14th larger
00:56:53 it's a very big number so you know we're not talking just an order of magnitude increase in energy we're talking 14
00:56:58 orders of magnitude energy increase so to give you a sense of what that would look like were you to build a particle
00:57:04 accelerator with today's technology bigger or smaller and then our solar system as start the size of the galaxy
00:57:10 the galaxy so you need to put a particle accelerator that circled the Milky Way to get to the energies where you would
00:57:18 see strings if they exist so there's a fundamental or problem which is that most of the predictions of the unified these unified
00:57:25 theories of quantum theories of gravity only make statements that are testable are energies that we will not be able to
00:57:34 probe let and barring some unbelievable you know completely unexpected technological or scientific breakthrough
00:57:39 which is almost impossible to imagine you never never say never but it seems very unlikely yeah I can just see the
00:57:47 news story Elon Musk decides to build a particle collider the size of our it would have to be we'd have to get
00:57:53 together with all our galactic neighbors to pay for everything what is the exciting possibilities of
00:57:59 the Large Hadron Collider what is there to be discovered in this in this order of magnitude of scale is there other
00:58:09 bigger efforts on the horizon big in this space what are the open problems the exciting possibilities you mentioned
00:58:16 supersymmetry yeah so well there are lots of new ideas well there's lots of problems that we're facing so there's a
00:58:20 problem with the Higgs field which supersymmetry was supposed to solve there's the fact that 95% of the
00:58:27 universe we know from cosmology astrophysics is invisible that it's made of dark matter and dark energy which are
00:58:34 really just words for things that we don't know what they are it's what Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown
00:58:40 we know we don't know what they are well that's it's better than an unknown unknown yeah well there may be some
00:58:44 unknown unknown but I don't know what those yeah but but the the hope is the particle accelerator could help us make
00:58:55 sense of dark energy dark matter there's still there's just some hope for that there's hope for that yes so one of the
00:59:01 hopes is the LHC could produce a Dark Matter particle in its collisions and you know it may be that the LHC will
00:59:10 still discover new particles that it might still supersymmetry could still be there we just it's just maybe more
00:59:14 difficult to find than we thought originally and and you know dark matter particles might be being produced but
00:59:20 we're just not looking in the right part of the data for them that that's possible it might be that we need more
00:59:24 data that these processes are very rare and we need to collect lots and lots of data before we see them but I think a
00:59:31 lot of people would say now that the chances of the LHC directly discovering new particles in
00:59:38 the near future is quite slim it may be that we need a decade more data before we can see something or we may not see
00:59:45 anything that's the that's what we are so I mean the the physics the experiments that I work on so I work on
00:59:51 a detector called LHC B which is one of these four big detectors that are spaced around the ring and we do slightly
00:59:57 different stuff to the big guys there's two big experiments called outlets and CMS three thousand physicists and
01:00:03 scientists and computer scientists on them each they are the ones that discovered the Higgs then they look for
01:00:08 supersymmetry and dark matter and so on what we look at our standard model particles called B quarks which
01:00:15 depending on your preference is either bottom or beauty we tend to say beauty because it sounds sexier yeah but these
01:00:23 particles are interesting because they of you can make lots of them we make billions or Billy a hundreds of billions
01:00:29 of these things you can therefore measure their properties very precisely so you can make these really lovely
01:00:36 precision measurements and what we are doing really is a sort of complementary thing to the other big experiments which
01:00:43 is they if you think the self analogy that I often use is if you imagine you're looking in you're in a jungle and
01:00:48 you're looking for an elephant same and you are a hunter and you're kind of like they said there's the relevance very
01:00:54 rare you don't know where in the jungle the jungles big so there's two ways you go about this either you can go out
01:00:59 wandering around the jungle and try and find the elephant the problem is if the elephant there's only one elephant the
01:01:03 jungles big the chances of running into it very small or you could look on the ground and see if you see footprints
01:01:09 left by the elephant and if the elephant's moving around you've got a chance that you're better chance maybe
01:01:13 of seeing the elephant's footprints if you see the footprints you go okay there's an elephant maybe don't know
01:01:18 what kind of elephant it is but I got a sense there's something out there so that's sort of what we do we are the
01:01:24 footprint people we are we're looking for the footprint the impressions that quantum fields that we haven't managed
01:01:32 to directly create the particle of the effects these quantum fields have on the ordinary standard model fields that we
01:01:37 already know about so these these be particles the way they behave can be influenced by the presence of say super
01:01:44 fields or dark matter fields or whatever you like and they're the way they decay and hey've can be altered slightly from what
01:01:51 our theory tells us they ought to behave sure and it's easier to collect huge amounts of data and B and B quarks we
01:01:57 get you know billions and billions of these things you can make very precise measurements and the only place really
01:02:04 at the LHC or in really in high-energy physics at the moment where there's fairly compelling evidence that there
01:02:10 might be something beyond the standard model is in these be these beauty quarks decays just to clarify which is the
01:02:19 difference between the different the four experiments for example the emission is it the kind of particles
01:02:25 that are being collided is it the energies that were which there collided what's the fundamental difference
01:02:31 different experiments the collisions are the same what's different is the design of the detectors so Atlas and CMS are
01:02:37 called they're called what are called general purpose detectors and they are basically barrel shaped machines and the
01:02:43 collisions happen in the middle of the barrel and the barrel captures all the particles that go flying out in every
01:02:49 direction so in a sphere effectively they can flying out and it can record all of those particles and what's the
01:02:55 site of interrupting but what's what's the mechanism of the recording oh these detectors if you've seen pictures of
01:03:02 them the huge like Atlas is 25 meters high in 45 meters long and vast machines instruments I guess you to call them
01:03:10 really they are they're kind of like onions so they have layers concentric layers of detective detectors different sorts of
01:03:17 detectors so close into the beam pipe you have what a record usually made of silicon their tracking detectors so
01:03:23 they're little made of strips of silicon or pixels of silicon and when a particle goes through the silicon it gives a
01:03:28 little electrical signal and you get these dots you know electrical dots through your detector which allows you
01:03:33 to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle so that's the middle and then the outside of these detectors you have
01:03:38 things called calorimeters which measure the energies of the particles and in very edge you have things called muon
01:03:44 chambers which basically met these muon particles which are the heavy version of the electron they are there like
01:03:48 high-velocity bullets and they can get right to the edge of the detectors if you see something at the edge that's a
01:03:53 muon so that's broadly how they work and all there's being recorded that's all being fed out to you know computers
01:04:01 must be awesome okay so LHCb is different so we because we're looking for these B quarks yes B quarks tend to
01:04:08 be produced along the beam lines so in a collision the B quark tend to fly sort of close to the beam pipe so we built
01:04:14 the detector that sort of pyramid cone-shaped basically that just looks in one directions we ignore if you have
01:04:21 your collision stuff goes everywhere we ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways we're just looking in this
01:04:27 little region close to the beam pipe where most of these B quarks are made so is there a different aspect of the
01:04:35 sensors involved in the collection of the B quark yes Jack thérèse there are some differences so one of the
01:04:41 differences is that one of the ways you know you've seen a B quark is that B quarks are actually quite long-lived by
01:04:47 particle standards so they live for 1.5 trillions of a second which is if you're if you're a fundamental particle is a
01:04:52 very long time because you know the Higgs boson I think lives for about a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
01:04:58 or maybe even less than that so these are quite long-lived things and they will actually fly a little distance
01:05:04 before they decay so they will fly you know a few centimeters maybe if you're lucky then they'll decay into other stuff so
01:05:09 what we need to do in the middle of the detector you want to be able to see you have your place where the protons crash
01:05:15 into each other and that produces loads of particles that come flying out so you have loads of lines loads of tracks that
01:05:21 point back to that proton collision and then you're looking for a couple of other tracks maybe two or three that
01:05:26 point back to a different place this may be a few centimeters away from the proton collision and that's the sign
01:05:31 that little B particle has flown a few centimeters in decayed somewhere else so we need to be able to very accurately
01:05:38 resolve the proton collision from the B particle decay so we are the middle of our detector is very sensitive and it
01:05:44 gets very close to the collisions so you have this really beautiful delicate silicon detector that sits I think it's
01:05:51 seven mil millimeters from the beam and the LHC beam has as much energy as a jumbo jet takeoff so it's enough to melt
01:05:57 a ton of copper and as you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next it's tiny delicate you know sense of the
01:06:02 consent sir so that into those aspects of our detector that are specialized to desert
01:06:09 to discover these particular B quarks that were interested in and is there I mean I remember seeing somewhere that
01:06:14 there's some mention of matter and antimatter connected to the be the these beautiful quarks who's that
01:06:23 what what's the connection wha yeah what's the connection there yes there is a connection which is that when
01:06:31 you produce these B particles it'll be these particles consider to the B quark you see the thing that B quark
01:06:36 is inside so they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles where the B quark is joined together with another
01:06:41 quark or two maybe two other clocks depending on what it is there a particular set of these B particles that
01:06:49 exhibit this property called oscillation so if you make her for the sake of argument a matter version of one of
01:06:56 these B particles as it travels because of the magic of quantum mechanics it oscillates backwards and forwards
01:07:02 between its matter and antimatter versions so just this weird flipping about backwards and forwards and what we
01:07:09 can use this for is a laboratory for testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter so if the if the symmetry but
01:07:17 transparency is precise its exact then we should see these B particles decaying as often as matter as they do as
01:07:22 antimatter because this oscillation should be even it should spend much time in each state but what we actually see
01:07:29 is that one of the states it spends more time and it's more likely to decay in one state than the other so this gives
01:07:35 us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter so what can you sort of return the the
01:07:43 question or before about this fundamental symmetry it seems like if this perfect symmetry between matter and
01:07:53 antimatter if the equal amount of each in our universe it would just destroy itself mm-hm and just like you mentioned we
01:08:00 seem to live in a very unlikely universe where it it doesn't destroy itself yeah so do you have some intuition about
01:08:09 about why that is I mean well I I'm not a theory I don't have any particular ideas myself I mean I sort of do
01:08:13 measurements to try and test these things but I mean it's in terms of the basic problem is that in the Big Bang if
01:08:19 you use the standard model to figure out what ought to have happened you should have got equal amounts of matter
01:08:22 antimatter made because whenever you make a particle in our collide collisions for exam
01:08:26 but when we collide stuff together you make a particle you make an antiparticle they always come together they always
01:08:31 annihilate together so there's no way of making more matter than antimatter that we've discovered so far so that means in
01:08:36 the Big Bang you get equal amounts of matter antimatter as the universe expands and cools down during the Big
01:08:43 Bang not very long after the Big Bang I think a few seconds off the Big Bang you have this event called the great
01:08:48 annihilation which is where all the particles antiparticles smack into each other annihilate turn into light mostly and
01:08:55 you end up with a universe later right if that was what happened then the universe we live in today would be black
01:09:00 and empty apart from some photons that would be it so there's stuff in this there is stuff in the universe it
01:09:04 appears to be just made of matter so there's this big mystery as to where the how did this happen and there are
01:09:12 various ideas which all involve sort of physics going on in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang so it
01:09:20 could be that one possibility is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this that there was this event that took
01:09:27 place in the early universe where the higgs field basically switched on it acquired its modern value and when that
01:09:34 happened this caused all the particles to acquire mass and the universe basically went through a phase
01:09:39 transition where you had a hot plasma of massless particles and then in that plasma it's almost like a gas turning
01:09:45 into droplets of water you get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe where the Higgs field has
01:09:51 acquired its modern value the particles have got mass and this phase transition in some models can cause more matter
01:09:58 than antimatter to be produced depending on how matter bounces off these bubbles in the early universe so that's one idea
01:10:04 there's other ideas to do with neutrinos that there are exotic types of neutrinos that can decay in a biased way to just
01:10:11 matter and not to antimatter so and people are trying to test these ideas that's what we're trying to do at LHC B
01:10:15 is there's neutrino experiments planned they're trying to do these sorts of things as well so yeah there are ideas
01:10:21 but at the moment no clear evidence for which of these ideas might be right so we're talking about some incredible
01:10:27 ideas by the way never hurt anyone be so eloquent about describing even just a standard model so I'm in awe just
01:10:36 listening if you're interesting just have having fun enjoying it so the yes the theoretical the particle
01:10:43 physics is fascinating here to me one of the most fascinating things about the Large Hadron Collider is the human side
01:10:50 of it that a bunch of sort of brilliant people that probably have egos got together and we collaborate together and
01:10:58 countries I guess collaborate together you know for the funds and that everything's just collaboration
01:11:06 everywhere because you maybe I don't know what the right question here to ask but almost what's your intuition about
01:11:11 how was possible to make this happen and what are the lessons we should learn for the future of human civilization in
01:11:17 terms of our scientific progress because it seems like this is a great great illustration of us working together to
01:11:25 do something big yeah I think it's possibly the best example maybe I can think of of international collaboration
01:11:32 it isn't for some unpleasant purpose basically you know it's I mean so I I when I started out in the field in 2008
01:11:40 I as a new PhD student the LHC was basically finished so I didn't have to go around asking for money for it or
01:11:46 trying to make the case so I have huge admiration admiration for the people who managed that because this was a project
01:11:52 that was first imagined in the 1970s and the late 70s was when the first conversations about the LHC were were
01:11:58 mooted and it took two and a half decades of campaigning and fundraising and persuasion until they started
01:12:05 breaking ground and building the thing in the early noughties in 2000 so I mean I think the reason just from  sort of
01:12:12 from the point of view of this sort of science the scientists there I think the reason it works ultimately is that
01:12:19 everywhere everyone there is there for the same reason which is well in principle at least they're there because
01:12:25 they're interested in the world they want to find out you know what are the basic ingredients of our universe what
01:12:31 are the laws of nature and so everyone is pulling in the same direction of course everyone has their own things
01:12:36 they're interested in everyone has their own careers to consider and you know and pretend that there isn't also a lot of
01:12:41 competitions this is funny thing in these experiments where your collaborators your eight-hundred
01:12:46 collaborators in LHC be but you're also competitors because you're academics in your various universities and you want
01:12:51 to be the one that gets the paper out on the most citing you know new measurements so
01:12:54 there's this funny thing where you're kind of trying to stake out your territory while also collaborating and
01:12:59 having to work together to make the experiments work and it does work amazingly well actually considering all
01:13:06 of that and I think there was actually I think McKinsey or one of these big management consultancy firms went into
01:13:12 CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try to understand how these organizations functions they figure it out I don't
01:13:18 think they could I mean I think one of the things that interests one of the other interesting things about these
01:13:22 experiments is that their big operations like say outlets there's 3,000 people now there is a person nominally who is
01:13:27 the head of Atlas they're called the spokesperson and the spokesperson is elected by usually by the collaboration
01:13:36 but they have no actual power really I mean they can't fire anyone they're not anyone's boss so you know my boss is it
01:13:42 prefers the professor a professor at Cambridge not the head of my experiments the head of my experiment can't tell me
01:13:48 what to do really and I mean there's all you got is independent academics who are their own bosses who you know so that
01:13:55 somehow it nonetheless by kind of consensus and discussion and lots of meetings these you know things do happen
01:14:02 and it does get done but it's like the Queen hearing you in the UK is the spokesperson again so no actual don't
01:14:09 elect her know whatever everybody seems to love her I don't know from the at my outside perspective yeah but yeah giant
01:14:21 egos brilliant people and moving forward do you think there's I would pick up one thing you said just that just the
01:14:26 brilliant people thing cuz I'm not I'm not saying that people aren't great yeah but I think there is this sort of
01:14:31 impression that physicists will have to be brilliant or geniuses which is not true actually and you know you have to
01:14:38 be relatively bright for sure but you know a lot of people a lot of the most successful experimental physicists and
01:14:43 not necessarily the people with the biggest brains they're the people who you know particularly one of the skills
01:14:47 that's most important in particle physics is the ability to work with others and to collaborate and exchange
01:14:52 ideas and also to work hard and it's a sort of often it's more a determination or a sort of other set of skills is not
01:14:59 just being you know kind of some great brain very true so in I mean there's parallels to that in the machine
01:15:06 learning world if you wanted if you want to solve any real-world problems which I see is the the particle
01:15:13 accelerators essentially a real-world instantiation of theoretical physics and for that you have to not necessarily be
01:15:23 brilliant but be sort of obsessed systematic rigorous sort of unbel stubborn all those kind of qualities
01:15:31 that make for a great engineer so this science scientist purely speaking the practitioner of the scientific method so
01:15:38 you're right but nonetheless Timmy that's Timmy has been my dad as a physicist I argue with him all the time
01:15:45 to me engineering is the highest form of science and he thinks that's all nonsense that the real work is done by
01:15:53 the theory edition so he in fact we have arguments about like people like Elon Musk for example because I think his
01:15:58 work is quite brilliant but he's fundamentally not coming up with any serious breakthroughs he's just creating
01:16:07 in this world implementing I'd like making ideas happen and have a huge impact to me that is that's the Edison
01:16:19 that Timmy is is a brilliant work but to him it's you know it's messy details that somebody will figure out anyway
01:16:26 that's it I mean I don't know whether you think there is a actual difference in temperament between say a physicist
01:16:32 and engineer whether it's just what you got interested in I don't know I mean because you know a lot of what
01:16:38 experimental physicists do is to some extent engineering and it's not what I do I mostly do data stuff but you know a
01:16:45 lot of people would be called electrical engineers but they trained as physicists but they learn electrical engineering
01:16:49 for example because they were building detectors so there's not such a clear divide I think yeah it's interesting I
01:16:55 mean there but there does seem to be like you work with data there does seem to be a certain like I love data collection
01:17:03 there might be an OCD element or something that you're more naturally predisposed to as opposed to theory like
01:17:10 I'm not afraid of data I love data and there's a lot of people machine learning core more like they're they're basically
01:17:17 afraid of data collection afraid of datasets afraid of all that they just want to
01:17:20 stay more than theoretical and they're really good at it space I don't know if that's a genetic that's your upbringing
01:17:27 the way you with it the way you go to school but looking into the future of LHC and other colliders so there's in
01:17:36 the in America there's the whatever was called the super there's a lot of super superconducting supercollider is super
01:17:43 gonna desert roll desert Ron yeah so that was cancelled the construction of that yeah which is a sad thing but what
01:17:53 do you think is the future of these efforts will a bigger Collider be built will LHC be expanded what do you think
01:18:02 well in the near future the LHC is gonna get an upgrade so that's pretty much confirmed I think it is confirmed which
01:18:08 is the it's not an energy upgrade it's and what we call the luminosity upgrade so basically means increasing their data
01:18:14 collection rates so more collisions per second basically because after a few years of data taking you get this law of
01:18:20 diminishing returns where each year's worth of data is a smaller and smaller fraction of the lot you've already got
01:18:24 so to get a real improvement in sensitivity you need to increase the data rate by an order of magnitude so
01:18:30 that's what this upgrade is gonna do an LHC be at the moment the whole detector is basically being rebuilt to allow it
01:18:37 to record data at a much larger rate than we could before so that will make her sensitive to whole loads of new
01:18:41 processes that we weren't able to study before and you know I mentioned briefly these anomalies anomalies that we've
01:18:47 seen so we've seen a bunch of very intriguing anomalies in these B quark decays which may be hinting at the first
01:18:56 signs of this kind of the elephant you know that the the size of some new quantum field or fields may be beyond
01:19:01 the standard model it's not yet at the statistical threshold where you can say that you've observed something but
01:19:08 there's lots of anomalies in many measurements that all seem to be consistent with each other so it's quite
01:19:13 interesting so you know the upgrade will allow us to really homed in on these things and see whether these alumni's
01:19:19 are real because if they are real and it kind of connects to your point about the next generation of machines what we
01:19:26 would have seen then is you know we will have seen the tail end of some quantum field in influencing these big quarks
01:19:33 what we then need to do build a bigger Collider to actually make the the particle of that field so if
01:19:39 these are if these things really do exist so that would be one argument I mean I mean so at the moment Europe has going
01:19:46 through this process of thinking about the strategy for the future so there are a number of different proposals on the
01:19:52 table one is for sort of higher energy upgrade at the LHC where you just build more powerful magnets and put them in
01:19:56 the same tunnel that's a sort of cheap cheaper less ambitious possibility most people don't really like it because it's
01:20:02 sort of a bit of a dead end because once you've done that there's nowhere to go well there's a machine called clique
01:20:09 which is a compact linear collider which is a electron positron Collider that's uses a novel type of acceleration
01:20:14 technology to accelerate at shorter distances we're still talking kilometers long but not like 100 kilometers long
01:20:21 and then the probably the project that is I think getting the most support it'll be interested to see what happens
01:20:26 something called the future circular Collider which is a really ambitious long-term multi-decade project to build
01:20:35 a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel under the Geneva region the LHC would become a kind of feeding machine it
01:20:42 would just feed for the same area so there would be a theater for there yeah so it kind of the edge machine would be
01:20:48 where the LHC is but it would sort of go under Lake Geneva and round to the Alps basically since you know up to the edge
01:20:53 of the Geneva base and so basically biggest it's the biggest tunnel you can fit in the region based on the geology
01:20:59 alarm yes it's big it'd be a long drive if your animal experiments on one side you got to go back to CERN for lunch so
01:21:05 that would be a pain but you know so this project is in principle is actually to accelerators the first thing you
01:21:10 would do is put an electron-positron machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs so you'd make lots of
01:21:16 Higgs boson study it really precisely in the hope that you see it misbehaving and doing something it's not supposed to and
01:21:23 then in the much longer term a hundred with that machine gets taken out you put in a proton proton machine so it's like
01:21:29 the LHC but much bigger and that's the way you start going and looking for dark matter or you're trying to recreate this
01:21:36 a phase transition that I talked about in the early universe but you can see matter antimatter being made for
01:21:40 examples there's lots of things you can do with these machines the problem is that they will take you know the most
01:21:46 optimistic you're not going to have any data from any of machines until 2040 or you know because
01:21:51 they take such a long time to build and they're so expensive so you have W a process of R&D design and also the
01:21:58 political case being made so la seal cost a few billion depends how you count it I think most of the sort of more
01:22:05 reasonable estimates that take everything into account properly it's around the sort of 10 11 12 billion euro
01:22:12 mark what would be the future sir I forgot the numerator future circular Collider future circular because you
01:22:16 mean I would call it that when it's built because it won't be the future anymore but a very big Hadron Collider I
01:22:28 don't know but yeah that will I know I should know the numbers but I think the whole project is estimated at about 30
01:22:33 billion euros but that's money spent over between now and 2017 probably which is when the last bit of it would be sort
01:22:42 of finishing up I guess so you're talking a half a century of science coming out of this thing
01:22:49 shared by many countries so the actual cost the arguments that are made is that you could make this project fit within
01:22:56 the existing budget of certain if you didn't do anything else it's earned by the way we didn't mention what is CERN
01:23:02 CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research as an international organization that was established in the
01:23:08 1950s in the wake of the Second World War as a kind of it was sort of like a scientific martial plan for Europe the
01:23:14 idea was that you bring european science back together for peaceful purposes because what happened in the 40s was you
01:23:21 know a lot of particular scientists but a lot of scientists from Central Europe had fled to the United States and Europe
01:23:27 and sort of seen his brain drain so it's a desire to bring the community back together for a project that wasn't
01:23:32 building nasty bombs but was doing something that was curiosity driven so and that has continued since then so
01:23:38 it's kind of a unique organization it's you to be a member as a country you sort of sign up as a member and then you have
01:23:46 to pay a fraction of your GDP each year is a subscription I mean it's a very small fraction relatively speaking I
01:23:50 think it's like I think the UK's contribution is 100 or 200 million quid or something like that yeah which is
01:23:58 quite a lot but no not that's fastest man I mean just the whole thing that is possible it's beautiful
01:24:03 it's a beautiful idea especially with when there's no wars on the line it's not like we're freaking out as we're
01:24:08 actually legitimately collaborating mmm to do good sighs one of the things I don't think we really mentioned is that
01:24:13 in the final side that sort of the data analysis side is there a break there was possible there and the machine learning
01:24:20 side like is there is there a lot more signal to be mined in more effective ways from the actual raw data yeah a lot
01:24:27 of people are looking into that I mean so what we know I use machine learning in my data analysis but pretty knotty
01:24:34 you know basic stuff because I'm not a machine learning expert and just a physicist who had to learn to do this
01:24:39 stuff for my day job so what a lot of people do is they use kind of off-the-shelf packages that you can
01:24:46 train to do signal noise you know just like a cleanup yeah but one of the big challenges you know the big challenge of
01:24:53 the data is a it's volume there's huge amounts of data so the LHC generates now okay I bought the actual numbers are but
01:24:59 if you we don't record all our data we record a tiny fraction of the data it's like of order one ten thousandth or
01:25:07 something I think right around that so it's it votes mostly gets thrown away you couldn't record all the LHC data
01:25:11 because it would fill up every computer in the world in the matter of days basically so there's this process that
01:25:17 happens on live on the detector something called a trigger which in real time 40 million times every second has
01:25:23 to make a decision about whether this collision is likely to contain an interesting object like a Higgs boson or
01:25:28 a Dark Matter particle and it has to do that very fast and the software algorithms in the past were quite
01:25:36 relatively basic you know they did things like measure mementos and energies of particles and put some
01:25:41 requirements so you would say if there's a particle with an energy above some threshold then record this collision but
01:25:46 if there isn't don't wear as now the attempt is get more and more machine learning in at the earliest possible
01:25:52 stage because cool at the stage of deciding whether we want to keep this data or not but also even even maybe
01:25:59 even lower down than that which is the point where there's this you know generally how the data is reconstructed
01:26:05 is you start off with a digital a set of digital hits in your detector so Scannell saying did you see something do
01:26:10 you not see something that has to be then turned into tracks particles going in different directions and that's done by
01:26:16 using fits that fit through the data points and then that's passed to the algorithms that then go is this
01:26:21 interesting or not what we better is if you could train machine learning to look at the raw hits the basic real base
01:26:26 level information not have any of the reconstruction done and it just goes and it can learn to do pattern recognition
01:26:32 on this strange three dimensional image that you get and potentially that's where you could get really big gains
01:26:38 because our triggers tend to be quite inefficient because they don't have time to do the full whiz-bang processing to
01:26:44 get all the information out that we would like because you have to do the decision very quickly so if you can come
01:26:49 up with some clever machine learning technique then potentially you can massively increase the amount of useful
01:26:56 data you record and you know get rid of more of the background earlier in the process yeah to me that's an exciting
01:27:02 possibility because then you don't have to build a sort of you can get again without having to have to put an ephod
01:27:11 whereas per hardware yeah but I do you need you need lots of new GPU farms I guess so hardware it still helps but
01:27:20 yeah the you know I got a talk to you so if I'm not sure how to ask but you're clearly an incredible science
01:27:28 communicator I don't know if that's the right term but you're basically a younger Neil deGrasse Tyson with a
01:27:33 British accent huh so and you but I mean can you save where we are today actually yeah so
01:27:41 today we're in the Royal Institution in London which is an old very old organization has been around for about
01:27:48 two hundred years now I think maybe even I should know when it was founded so the early 19th century it was set up to
01:27:55 basically communicate science the public so it was one of the first places in the world where scientists famous scientists
01:28:02 would come and give talks so very famously my Humphrey Davy who you may know of who was the person who
01:28:07 discovered nitrous oxide is a very famous chemist and scientists also discovered electronic sis so he used to
01:28:14 do these fantastic was very charismatic speakers who's to peer here there was a there's a big desk they usually have in
01:28:18 the inner theater and he would do demonstrations to the sort of the the folk of London back in the early 19th
01:28:24 century and Michael Faraday who I talked about who is the person who did so much work connection Magnussen he used he
01:28:28 lectured here he did experiments in the basement so this place has got a long history of both
01:28:34 scientific research but also in the communication of scientific research so you gave a few lectures here how many -
01:28:40 I've give I given you I given a couple of lectures in this theater before so I mean that's think so people should
01:28:47 definitely go watch online it's there's just the explanation of particle physics that all the good thing it's incredible
01:28:52 like your your lectures are just incredible I can't sing it enough pray so it was awesome but maybe can you say
01:29:01 what did that feel like what was if you like to lecture here to talk about that and maybe from a different perspective
01:29:08 more kind of like how the sausage is made is how do you prepare for that kind of thing how do you think about
01:29:15 communication the process of communicating these ideas in a way that's inspiring to what I would say
01:29:21 your talks are inspiring to like the general audience you don't actually have to be a scientist you can still be
01:29:27 inspired without really knowing much of the you you start from the very basics so what's the preparation process and
01:29:35 then the romantic question is what does that feel like to perform here I mean profession yeah I mean the process I
01:29:42 mean the talk that the my favorite talk that I gave here was one called beyond the Higgs which you can find on the on
01:29:46 the all institutions youtube channel which you should go and check out I mean and their channels got loads of great
01:29:52 talks loads of great people as well I mean that one I sort of given a version of it many times so part of it is just
01:29:57 practice right I and actually I don't have some great theory of how to communicate with people it's more just
01:30:02 that I'm really interested and excited by those idiot and I like talking about them and through the process of doing
01:30:09 that I guess I figured out stories that work and explanations that well you see a practice you mean legitimately just
01:30:15 giving just giving talks given I said I started off you know when I was a PhD student doing talks in schools and and I
01:30:20 still do that as well some of the time and doing things I haven't done a bit of stand-up comedy which was sort of went
01:30:25 reasonably well even if it was terrifying and that's unusual as well there's also a new I wouldn't I wouldn't
01:30:30 necessarily recommend you check that out I'm gonna post the links several places to make sure people click on it yeah
01:30:37 it's basically I kind of have a story in my head and I is I you know I kind of I have a think about what I want to say I
01:30:42 usually have some images to support what I'm saying and I get up and do it and it's not really I wish
01:30:47 there was some kind of I probably should have some proper process this is very sounds like I'm just making up as I go
01:30:52 along and I sort of am I think the fundamental thing they said I think it's like I don't know if you know who a guy
01:31:03 named Joe Rogan is yes okay so he he's also kind of sounds like you in a sense that he's not very introspective about
01:31:09 his process but he's an incredibly engaging conversationalist and I think one of the things that you and him share
01:31:17 that I could see is like a genuine curiosity and passion for the topic I think that could be systematically
01:31:27 caught you know cultivated I'm sure there's a process to it but you come to it naturally somehow I think maybe
01:31:32 there's something else as well which is to understand something there's this quote by firemen whichever you like
01:31:37 which is what I cannot create I do not understand so like I'm not I'm not like particularly super bright like so for me
01:31:45 to understand something I have to break it down into its simplest element yes and that you know if and if I can then
01:31:50 tell people about that that helps me understand it as well so I've actually I've learned I've learned to understand
01:31:56 physics a lot more from the process of communication because it forces you to really scrutinize the ideas that you're
01:32:02 communicating in a coffin makes you realise you don't really understand the ideas you're talking about and I'm
01:32:08 writing a book at the moment I had this experience yesterday where I realized I didn't really understand a pretty
01:32:13 fundamental theoretical aspect of my own subject and I had to go and hide to sort of spend a couple of days reading
01:32:19 textbooks and thinking about it in order to make sure that the explanation I gave captured the got as close to what is
01:32:26 actually happening in the theory and to do that you have to really understand it properly and yeah and there's layers to
01:32:32 understanding yeah it seems like the more there must be some kind of Fineman law I mean the the more you the more you
01:32:40 understand services simply you're able to really convey the you know the the essence of the idea right so it's just
01:32:50 like this reverse the reverse effect there's like the more you understand the simpler the final thing that you
01:32:56 actually convey and so the more accessible somehow it becomes that's why faint fineman's
01:33:03 lectures are really accessible it was just counterintuitive yeah although there are some ideas that are very
01:33:09 difficult to explain no matter how well or badly you understand like I still can't really
01:33:15 properly explain the Higgs mechanism yeah with because some of these ideas only exist in mathematics really and the
01:33:23 only way to really develop an understanding is to go unfortunately to a graduate degree in physics but you can
01:33:31 get kind of a flavor of what's happening I think and is trying to do that in a way that isn't misleading but always
01:33:38 also intelligible so let me ask them the romantic question of what to you is the most perhaps an unfair question what is
01:33:49 the most beautiful idea in physics one that fills you with are is the most surprising the strangest the weirdest
01:33:55 there's some a lot of different definitions of beauty mmm-hmm and I'm sure there's several for you but is
01:34:01 there something just jumps to mind that you think is just especially I mean I well beautiful there's a specific thing
01:34:09 in a more general thing so maybe the specific thing a first widget is a cone i first came across this as an
01:34:13 undergraduate i found this amazing so this idea that the forces of nature electromagnetism strong force the weak
01:34:22 force they arise in our theories has there a consequence of symmetries so symmetry is in the laws of nature in the
01:34:29 equations essentially that used to describe these ideas the process whereby theories come up with these sorts of
01:34:36 models as they say imagine the universe obeys this particular type of symmetry is a
01:34:42 symmetry that isn't so far removed from a geometrical symmetry like the rotations of a cube it's not you can't
01:34:47 think of it quite that way but it's sort of a similar sort of idea and you say okay if the universe respects the
01:34:52 symmetry you find that you have to introduce a force which has the properties of electromagnetism or
01:34:59 different symmetry you get the strong force or a different symmetry you get the weak force so these interactions
01:35:05 seem to come from some deeper it suggests that they come from some deeper symmetry principle I mean depends a bit
01:35:09 how you look at it cuz it could be that we were actually just recognizing symmetries in fact as
01:35:13 you see but there's something rather lovely about that but I mean I suppose a bigger thing that makes me wonder is
01:35:19 actually if you look at the laws of nature how particles interacts when you get really close down they're basically
01:35:24 pretty simple things they bounce off each other by exchanging you know through force fields and they move
01:35:29 around in very simple ways and somehow these basic ingredients these few particles that we know about and the
01:35:35 forces creates this universe which is unbelievably complicated and has things like you and me in it and you know the
01:35:42 earth and stars that make matter in there caused by this from the gravitational energy of their own bulk
01:35:47 that then gets sprayed into the universe that forms other things I mean the fact that there's this incredibly long story
01:35:55 that goes right back to you know the big it we can we can take the story right back to you know a trillionth of a
01:35:59 second after the Big Bang we can trace the origins of the stuff that we're made from and it altum Utley comes from these
01:36:05 simple ingredients with these simple rules and the fact you can generate such complexity from that is really
01:36:11 mysterious I think and strange and it's not even a question that physicists can really tackle because we are sort of
01:36:17 trying to find these really elementary laws but it turns out that going from elementary laws and a few particles to
01:36:24 something even as complicated as a molecule becomes very difficult and so going from a molecule to a human being
01:36:30 is a problem that just you know can't be can't be tackled at least not at the moment so yeah the emergence of complexity from
01:36:39 simple rules is so beautiful and so mysterious and there's not either we don't have good mathematics to even try
01:36:46 to approach that emergent phenomena that's why we have chemistry and biology and other subjects as well yeah I don't
01:36:54 think I don't think there's a better way to end it Harry I can't I mean I think I speak for a lot of people that can't
01:37:02 wait to see what happens in the next 5 10 20 years with you I think you're one of the great communicators of our time
01:37:08 so I hope you continue that and I hope that grows and definitely a huge fan so it was an honor
