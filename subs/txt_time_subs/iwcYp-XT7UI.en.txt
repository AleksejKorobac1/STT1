00:00:01 the following is a conversation with George Hotz he's the founder of comma AI a machine learning based vehicle
00:00:08 automation company he is most certainly an outspoken personality in the field of AI and technology in general he first
00:00:15 gained recognition for being the first person to carry or unlock an iPhone and since then he's done quite a few
00:00:22 interesting things at the intersection of hardware and software this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you
00:00:29 enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it five stars on iTunes supported on patreon or simply connect with me on
00:00:37 Twitter at lex friedman spelled fri d-m a.m. and i'd like to give a special thank you to Jennifer from Canada for
00:00:45 her support of the podcast on patreon merci beaucoup Jennifer she's been a friend and an engineering colleague for
00:00:52 many years since I was in grad school your support means a lot and inspires me to keep this series going and now here's
00:01:02 my conversation with George Hotz do you yes but it may be unfalsifiable what do you mean by unfalsifiable so if the
00:01:16 simulation is designed in such a way that they did like a formal proof to show that no information can get in and
00:01:23 out and if their hardware is designed to for the anything in the simulation to always keep the hardware in spec it may
00:01:29 be impossible to prove whether we're in a simulation or not so they've designed it such there's the
00:01:36 closed system you can't get outside of the system well maybe it's one of three worlds
00:01:40 we're either in a simulation which can be exploited we're in a simulation which not only can't be exploited but like the
00:01:47 same things too about VMs I'm a really well-designed VM you can't even detect if you're in a VM or not that's brilliant
00:01:54 so where it's yeah so the simulation is running in a virtual machine but now in reality all VMs have wasted the fact
00:02:01 that's the point I mean is it yeah you've done quite a bit of hacking yourself and so you should know that
00:02:08 really any complicated system will have ways in and out so this isn't necessarily true going forward I spent
00:02:19 my time away from comma I learned and said dependently typed like it's a language for writing math proofs and if
00:02:26 you write code that compiles in a language like that it is correct by definition the types
00:02:34 check it's correct and so it's possible that the simulation is written in a language like this in which case yeah
00:02:42 yeah but that can't be sufficiently expressive a language like that all weekend it can be yeah okay well so all
00:02:49 right so the simulation doesn't have to be tiring complete if it has a scheduled end date looks like it does actually
00:02:55 with entropy and you know I don't think that a simulation that results in something as complicated in universe
00:03:06 would have a formal proof of correctness right as as possible of course we have no idea how good their tooling is and we
00:03:14 have no idea how complicated the universe computer really is it may be quite simple it's just very large right
00:03:22 it's very it's definitely very large but the fundamental rules might be super simple yeah Conway's gonna live kind of
00:03:30 stuff right so if you could hack it so imagine the simulation that is hackable if you could hack it what would you
00:03:38 change about the you know like how would you approach hacking a simulation the reason I gave that talk I by the way I'm
00:03:46 not familiar with the talk he gave I just read that you talked about escaping the simulation yeah like that so maybe
00:03:53 you can tell me a little bit about the theme and the message there - it wasn't a very practical talk about how to
00:04:01 actually escape a simulation it was more about a way of restructuring an us-versus-them narrative if we continue
00:04:11 on the path we're going with technology I think we're in big trouble like as a species and not just as a
00:04:17 species but even as me as an individual member of the species so if we could change rhetoric to be more like to think
00:04:28 upwards like to think about that we're in a simulation and how we could get out already we'd be on the right path what
00:04:34 you actually do once you do that while I assume I would have acquired way more intelligence in the process of doing
00:04:40 that so I'll just ask that so the the thinking upwards what kind of ideas what kind of breakthrough ideas do you think
00:04:47 thinking in that way could inspire and what did you say upwards upwards into space are you thinking sort of
00:04:55 exploration in all forms the space narrative that held for the modernist generation doesn't hold as well for the
00:05:03 postmodern generation what's the space narrator we're talking about the same space the dimensional
00:05:08 space like going a little ace is like building like yuan mosque like we're gonna build rockets we're gonna go to
00:05:12 Mars we're gonna colonize the universe and the narrative your friend was born in the Soviet Union you're referring to
00:05:18 the race to space the race to space explore okay that was a great modernist narrative it doesn't seem to hold the same weight
00:05:29 in today's culture I'm hoping for good postmodern narratives that replace it so think let's think so you work a lot with
00:05:37 AI so the eyes one formulation of that narrative there could be also I don't know how much you do in VR and they are
00:05:44 yeah that's another eye I know less about it but every time I play with it and our research is fascinating that
00:05:50 virtual world are you are you interested in the virtual world I would like to move to a virtual reality in terms of
00:05:56 your work no I would like to physically move there the apartment I can rent in the cloud is
00:06:01 way better in the apartment I can rent in the real world well it's all relative isn't it because others will have very
00:06:07 nice departments too so you'll be inferior in the virtual world that's not how I view the world right I don't view
00:06:13 the world I mean it's very like like almost zero-sum issue a to view the world say like my great apartment isn't
00:06:20 great because my neighbor has one - no my great apartment is great because like look at this dishwasher man yeah you
00:06:25 just touch the dish and it's washed right and that is great in and of itself if I have the only apartment or if
00:06:31 everybody had the apartment I don't care so you have fundamental gratitude the the world first learned of Geo ha George
00:06:42 Hotz in August 2007 maybe before then but certainly in August 2007 when you were the first person to unlock carry
00:06:49 unlock an iPhone how did you get into hacking what was the first system you discovered vulnerabilities for and broke
00:07:00 into so that was really kind of the first thing I had I had a book in in 2006 called grey hat hacking and I guess
00:07:12 I realized that if you acquired these sort of powers you could control the world but I didn't really know that much
00:07:21 about computers back then I started with electronics the first iPhone hack was physical card work you had to open it
00:07:28 up and pull an address line high and it was because I didn't really know about software exploitation I learned that all
00:07:33 in the next few years and I got very good at it but back then I knew about like how men
00:07:39 chips are connected to processors and he knew about software and programming he didn't didn't know I'll really see
00:07:46 you the view of the world and computers was physical was the most hard work actually if you read the code that I
00:07:52 released with that in August 2007 it's atrocious the language was it a C say yes and in a
00:08:01 broken sort of state machine SC I didn't know how to program man so how did you learn to program
00:08:09 what was your journey cuz I mean we'll talk about it you've live streams from your programming man this is a chaotic
00:08:15 beautiful mess how did you arrive at that years and years of practice I interned at Google after the summer
00:08:25 after the iPhone unlock and I did a contract for them where I built hardware for for Street View and I wrote a
00:08:32 software library to interact with it and it was terrible code and for the first time I got feedback from people who I
00:08:39 respected saying you know like don't write code like this now of course just getting that feedback is not enough the
00:08:51 way that I really got good was I wanted to write this thing like that could emulate and then visualize like armed
00:08:59 binaries because I wanted to hack the iPhone better and I didn't like that I couldn't like see what that I couldn't
00:09:03 single step through the processor because I had no debugger on there especially for the low level things like
00:09:07 the boot ROM in the bootloader so I tried to build this tool to do it and I built the tool once and it was
00:09:14 terrible I built the tool second times it was terrible I built the tool third time this by the
00:09:17 time I was at Facebook it was kind of okay and then I built the tool fourth time when I was a Google intern again in 2014
00:09:23 and that was the first time I was like this is finally usable how do you pronounce this kira-kira yeah
00:09:31 so it's essentially the most efficient way to visualize the change of state of the computer as the program is running
00:09:39 that's what I mean by debugger yeah it's a timeless debugger so you can rewind just as easily as going forward think
00:09:46 about if you're using gdb you have to put a watch on a variable if you want to see if that variable changes and Kure
00:09:51 you can just click on that variable and then it shows every single time when that variable was changed or accessed
00:09:57 think about it like get for your computers  the run lock so there's like a deep log of of the state of the
00:10:06 computer as the program runs and you can rewind why isn't that maybe it is maybe you can educate me what isn't that kind
00:10:14 of debugging used more often ah because the tooling is bad well two things one if you're trying to
00:10:21 debug chrome chrome is a 200 megabyte binary that runs slowly on desktops so that's going to be really hard to use
00:10:28 for that but it's really good to use for like CTFs and for boot roms and for small parts of code so it's it's hard if
00:10:35 you're trying to debug like massive systems what's the CTF and what's the boot ROM the boot ROM is the first code
00:10:41 that executes it's the minute you give power to your iPhone okay and CTF were these competitions that I played capture
00:10:47 the flag to capture the flag I was going to ask you about that what are those LaVette I watched a couple videos on
00:10:53 YouTube those look fascinating what have you learned about maybe at the high level of vulnerability of systems from
00:11:01 these competitions the like I feel like like in the heyday of CTFs you had all of the best security people in the world
00:11:10 challenging each other and coming up with new toy exploitable things over here and then everybody okay who can
00:11:16 break it and when you break it you get like there's like a file on the server called flag and then there's a program
00:11:21 running listening on a socket that's vulnerable so you write an exploit you she'll and then you cat flag and then
00:11:27 you type the flag into like a web-based scoreboard and you get points so the goal is essentially to find an exploit
00:11:33 in the system that allows you to run shell to run arbitrary code on that system that's one of the categories
00:11:42 that's like the PO noble category vulnerable yeah horrible it's like you know you pwned the program you are it's a program
00:11:52 yeah yeah you know for personally I apologize I'm gonna I'm gonna say it's because I'm Russian but maybe you can
00:12:01 help educate me some video game like misspell to own way back in the Mia and there's just I wonder if there's a
00:12:06 definition I'll have to go to urban dictionary for it okay so what was the heyday seat yeah by the way but was it
00:12:15 what decade are we talking about I think like I mean maybe I'm biased because it's the era that that that I played but
00:12:29 like 2011 to 2015 because the modern CTF scene is similar to the modern competitive programming scene you have
00:12:34 people who like do drills you have people who practice and then once you've done that you've turned it lesson to a
00:12:40 game of generic computer skill and more into a game of okay you memorize you you drill on these five categories and then
00:12:49 before that it wasn't it didn't have like as much attention as it had I don't know they were like I won $30,000 ones
00:12:55 in Korea for one of these competitions oh crap they were they were that so that means I mean money's money but that
00:13:02 means there was probably good people there exactly yeah are the challenges human constructive or are they grounded
00:13:10 in some real flaws and real systems usually they're human constructed but they're usually inspired by real flaws
00:13:17 what kind of systems are imagined is really focused on mobile like what has vulnerabilities these days is it does
00:13:24 primarily mobile systems like Android everything does No yeah of course the price has kind of gone up because less
00:13:31 and less people can find them and what's happened in security is now if you want to like jailbreak an iPhone you don't
00:13:37 need one exploit anymore you need nine nine chained together what women yeah Wow okay so it's really so what's the
00:13:45 but what's the benefit speaking higher level philosophically about hacking I mean it sounds from everything I've seen
00:13:51 about you you just love the challenge and you don't want to do anything you don't want to bring that exploit out
00:14:00 into the world and doing the actual let it run wild you just want to solve it and then you go on to the next thing oh
00:14:07 yeah I mean doing criminal stuffs not really worth it and I'll actually use the same argument for why I don't do
00:14:14 defense for why I don't do crime if you want to defend a system say the system has ten holes right if you find
00:14:21 nine of those holes as a defender you still lose because the attacker gets in through the last one if you're an
00:14:27 attacker you only have to find one out of the ten but if you're a criminal if you log on with a VPN nine out of the
00:14:36 ten times but one time you forget you're done because you're caught okay because you only have to mess up once to be
00:14:43 caught as a criminal yeah that's why I'm not a criminal but okay let me  that's having a
00:14:50 discussion with somebody just at a high level about nuclear weapons actually why we're having blowing ourselves up yet
00:14:58 and my feeling is all the smart people in the world look at the distribution of smart people smart people are generally
00:15:07 good and then this other person I was talking to Sean Carroll the physicist and you were saying no good and bad
00:15:12 people are evenly distributed amongst everybody my sense was good hackers are in general good people and they don't
00:15:20 want to mess with the world what's your sense I'm not even sure about that like I have a nice life crime wouldn't get me anything
00:15:35 but if you're good and you have these skills you probably have a nice life too right like you can use the father things
00:15:42 but is there an ethical is there some is there a little voice in your head that says well yeah if you could hack
00:15:51 something to where you could hurt people and you could earn a lot of money doing it though not hurt physically perhaps
00:15:58 but disrupt her life in some kind of way it is there a little voice that says what two things one I don't really care
00:16:06 about money so like the money wouldn't be an incentive the thrill might be an
00:16:12 incentive but when I was 19 I read crime and punishment right that was another that was another great one that talked
00:16:19 me out of ever really doing crime Oh cuz it's like that's gonna be me I'd get away with it whatever just went in my
00:16:26 head even if I got away with it you know and then you do crime for long enough you'll never get away with it that's
00:16:31 right in the end that's a good reason to be good I wouldn't say good I just say I'm not bad you're a talented programmer
00:16:39 and a hacker in a good positive sense of the word award you've played around found vulnerabilities in various systems
00:16:47 what have you learned broadly about the design of systems and so on from that from that whole process you learn to not
00:17:01 take things for what people say they are but you look at things for what they actually are
00:17:09 yeah I understand that's what you tell me it is but what does it do man and you have nice visualization tools to really
00:17:17 know what it's really doing oh I wish I'm a better programmer now than I was in 2014 I said Kira that was the first
00:17:23 tool that I wrote that was usable I wouldn't say the code was great I still wouldn't say my code is great so how was
00:17:30 your evolution as a programmer except practice he went he started with C at which point did you pick up Python
00:17:36 because you're pretty big and Python though now yeah in  in college I went to Carnegie Mellon when I was 22 I
00:17:44 went back I'm like I'm gonna take all your hardest CS courses we'll see how I do right like did I miss anything by not
00:17:50 having a real undergraduate education took operating systems compilers AI and they're like a freshman reader math
00:18:01 course and operating says some of these some of those classes you mentioned actually they're great at least one the
00:18:09 2012 circuit 2012 operating systems and compilers we're two of the best classes I've ever taken my life because you
00:18:15 write an operating system and you write a compiler I wrote my operating system in C and I wrote my compiler in Haskell
00:18:24 but classical well somehow I picked up Python that semester as well I started using it for the CTS actually that's
00:18:29 when I really started to get into CTF and CTF you're all to race against the clock so I can't write things and say oh
00:18:36 there's a clock component so you really want to use the programming language you can be fastest than 48 hours pone as
00:18:41 many of these challenges you can pone yeah you got like a hundred points a challenge whatever team gets the most
00:18:48 you were both the Facebook and Google for a brief stint yeah well the project zero actually at Google for five months
00:18:57 where you develop kara what was project zero about in general speak what what just curious about the security efforts
00:19:04 in these companies well product zero started the same time I I went there what what years are there
00:19:13 2015 2015 so that was right at the beginning of project it's small it's Google's offensive security team I'll
00:19:23 try to give I'll try to give the best public facing explanation that I can so the idea is basically these
00:19:32 vulnerabilities exist in the world nation states have them some high sometime people will find these
00:19:44 vulnerabilities and submit them in bug bounties to the companies but a lot of the companies don't really care it only
00:19:52 fix the bug there's no it doesn't hurt for there to be a vulnerability so project zero is like we're gonna do it
00:19:56 different we're going to announce a vulnerability and we're going to give them 90 days to fix it and then whether
00:20:01 they fix it or not we're gonna drop the drop the zero day oh wow we're gonna drop the weapon that's so cool that is
00:20:09 so cool I love that deadlines though that's so cool give him real deadlines yeah and I think it's done a lot for
00:20:16 moving the industry forward I watched your coding sessions on the stream downline you code things up basic
00:20:25 projects usually from scratch I would say sort of as a programmer myself just watching you that you type really fast
00:20:32 and your brain works in both brilliant and chaotic ways I don't know if that's always true but certainly for the live
00:20:38 streams so it's it's interesting to me because I'm more I'm much slower and systematic and careful and you just move
00:20:45 I mean probably an order of magnitude faster some curious is there a method to your madness
00:20:53 is this just who you are there's pros and cons there's pros and cons to my programming style and I'm aware of them
00:21:02 like if you ask me to like like get something up and working quickly with like an API that's kind of undocumented
00:21:08 I will do this super fast because I will throw things at it until it works if you ask me to take a vector and rotate it 90
00:21:16 degrees and then flip it over the XY plane I'll spam program for two hours and won't get it all because it's
00:21:24 something that you could do with a sheet of paper think through design and then just you really just throw stuff at the
00:21:33 wall and you get so good at it that it usually works I should become better at the other kind as well sometimes I'll do
00:21:40 things pathetically it's nowhere near as entertaining on the twitch streams I do exaggerate it a bit on the edge games as
00:21:44 well the twitch streams I mean what do you want to see a game or you want to see actions permit me right I'll show
00:21:49 you a PM for programming yes I recommend people go to I think I watched I was probably several hours you put
00:21:55 like I've actually left you programming in the background while I was programming because you made me you it
00:22:02 was it was like watching a really good gamer it's like energizes you because you're like moving so fast it so it's it's
00:22:09 awesome it's inspiring and so it made me jealous that like because my own program is inadequate in terms of speed Oh as I
00:22:19 was like so I'm twice as frantic on the live streams as I am when I code without oh it's super entertaining so I I wasn't
00:22:26 even paying attention to where you were coding which is great it's just watching you switch windows and VAM I guess is
00:22:33 driven screen I've developed a workflow Facebook and talk about how do you learn new programming tools ideas techniques
00:22:40 these days what's your like methodology for learning new things so I wrote for comma the distributed file systems out
00:22:50 in the world are extremely complex like if you want to install something like like like Saif Saif is I think the like
00:22:59 open infrastructure to should be a file system or there's like newer ones like seaweed FS but these are all like 10,000
00:23:07 plus line projects I think some of them are even 100,000 line and just configuring them as a nightmare so I
00:23:14 wrote I wrote one it's 200 lines and it's it uses like nginx to the live servers and has low
00:23:21 master server that I wrote and go and the way I go this if I would say that I'm proud per line of any code I wrote
00:23:28 maybe there's some exploits that I think are beautiful and then this this is 200 lines and just the way that I thought
00:23:34 about it I think was very good and the reason it's very good is because that was the fourth version of it that I
00:23:38 wrote and I had three versions that I threw away you mentioned you see go I ready go yeah and go so is that a
00:23:44 functional language I forget what goes they go is Google's language right I'm a functional it's some it's like in a way
00:23:57 it's C++ but easier it's it's strongly typed it has a nice ecosystem erotic when I first looked at it I was like
00:24:03 this is like Python but it takes twice as long to do anything yeah now that I've open pilot is migrating to
00:24:10 sea but it still has large Python components I now understand why Python doesn't work for large code bases and
00:24:15 why you want something like Oh interesting so why why doesn't Python work for so even most speaking for
00:24:22 myself at least like we do a lot of stuff basically demo level work with autonomous vehicles and most of the work
00:24:30 is Python yeah why doesn't Python work for large code bases because well lack of type checking is a big errors
00:24:41 creeping yeah and like you don't know the compiler can tell you like nothing right so everything is either you know
00:24:50 like like syntax errors fine but if you misspell a variable and Python the compiler won't catch that there's like
00:24:54 linters that can catch it some other time there's no types this is really the biggest downside and then will Python
00:25:02 slow but that's not related to it well maybe the kind of related to its that's lacking so what's what's in your toolbox
00:25:08 these days is a Python what else go I need to move on something else but my adventure interdependently type
00:25:14 languages I love these languages they just have like syntax from the 80s what do you think about JavaScript
00:25:23 yes thanks Nick tomorrow typescript javascript is the whole ecosystem is unbelievably confusing
00:25:31 NPM updates a package from zero to two to zero to five and that breaks your babble linter which translates your es5
00:25:40 into es6 which doesn't run on so why do I have to compile my JavaScript again huh it may be the future though if you
00:25:46 think about I mean I've embraced JavaScript recently because just like I've continually embraced PHP it seems
00:25:55 that these worst possible languages live on for long is that cockroaches never die yeah well it's in the browser and
00:26:02 it's fast it's fast yeah it's in the browser and compute mites they become you know the browser it's unclear what
00:26:09 the role the browser's in terms of distributed computation in the future so javascript is definitely here to stay
00:26:17 yeah interesting if Tom's vehicles will run on JavaScript one day I mean you have to consider
00:26:22 these possibilities well all our debug tools are JavaScript we actually just open-source them we
00:26:27 have a tool Explorer which you can annotate your dis engagements and we have tool cabana which lets you analyze
00:26:32 the canned traffic from the car so basically any time you're visualizing something about the log you using
00:26:38 javascript yeah well the web is the best UI toolkit by far yeah so and then you know what you're voting in
00:26:43 JavaScript we have a react guy he's good he acts nice let's get into it so let's talk to Thomas vehicles you found it
00:26:55 comma a let's at a high level how did you get into the world the vehicle automation can you also just for people
00:27:00 who don't know tell the story of comma yeah sure so I was working at this AI startup and a friend approached me and
00:27:11 he's like dude I don't know where this is going but the coolest applied AI problem today is self-driving cars I'm
00:27:19 like well absolutely do you want to meet with UI mosque and he's looking for somebody to build a vision system for
00:27:28 auto pilot this is when they were still on ap one they were still using mobile I kneel on back then was looking for a
00:27:36 replacement and he brought me in and we talked about a contract where I would deliver something that meets mobile eye
00:27:42 level performance I would get paid twelve million dollars if I could deliver it tomorrow and I would lose 1
00:27:46 million dollars for every month I didn't deliver yeah so I was like ok this is a great deal this is a super exciting
00:27:53 challenge you know what even if it takes me 10 months I get two million dollars it's good maybe I can finish up in five
00:27:58 maybe I don't finish it at all and I get paid nothing and I'll work for twelve months for free so maybe I just take a
00:28:03 pause on that I'm also curious about this because I've been working on robotics for a long time and I'm curious
00:28:08 to see a person like you just step in and sort of somewhat naive but brilliant right so that's though that's the best
00:28:14 place to be because you basically full-steam take on a problem how confident how from that time because you
00:28:22 know a lot more now at that time how hard do you think it is to solve all of autonomous driving I remember I
00:28:29 suggested to Elon in the meeting I'm putting GPU behind each camera to keep the compute local this is an incredibly
00:28:38 stupid idea I leave the meeting 10 minutes later and I'm like I could have spent a little bit of time thinking
00:28:44 about this problem was I would just send all your cameras to one big GPU you're much better off doing that oh sorry you
00:28:50 said behind every camera you have a small GPU I was like oh I'll put the first few layers of my comm there Oh
00:28:56 like why did I say that that's possible it's possible but it's a bad idea it's not obviously a bad idea pretty obvious
00:29:02 but whether it's actually a bad idea or not I left that meeting with Elon like beating myself up I'm like why did I say
00:29:08 something stupid yeah you haven't given I'm at least like thought through every aspect yes he's very sharp too like
00:29:15 usually in life I get away with saying stupid things and then kind of course alright right away he called me out
00:29:19 about it and like usually in life I get away with saying stupid things and then like people will you know people a lot
00:29:25 of times people don't even notice and I'll like correct it and bring the conversation back but with Elon it was
00:29:32 like nope like okay well that's not at all why the contract fell through I was much more prepared the second time I met
00:29:37 him yeah but in general huh how hard did you think it is like 12 months is -oh is it tough timeline oh I just thought
00:29:45 I'd clone mob like you three I didn't think I'd solve level five self-driving or anything so the goal there was to do
00:29:52 lane-keeping good good link keeping I saw my friend showed me the outputs from a mobile I in the office from a mobile I
00:29:57 was just basically two lanes at a position of a lead car mm-hm like I can I can gather a dataset and
00:30:03 train this net in in weeks and I did well first time I tried the implementation of mobile I and the test
00:30:10 I was really surprised how good it is it's quite incredibly good because I thought it's just because I've done a
00:30:15 lot of computation I thought it'd be a lot harder to create a system that that's stable so I was personally
00:30:24 surprised you know have to admit it because I was kind of skeptical before trying it because I thought it would go
00:30:31 in and out a lot more it would get disengaged a lot more and it's pretty robust so what how how hard is the
00:30:41 problem we need to when you tackled it I think a p1 was great like Elon talked about dis engagements on the 405 down in
00:30:50 LA we'd like the lane marks were kind of faded and the mobile eye system would drop out  like I had something up and
00:30:58 working that I would say was like the same quality in three months same quality but how do you know you you say
00:31:07 stuff like that yeah confidently but you can't and I love it but well the question is you can't you're kind of
00:31:14 going by feel because he not solely absolutely like like I would take I hadn't I borrowed my friends Tesla yeah
00:31:20 I would take ap one out for a drive yeah and then I would take my system out for a dry and seems reasonably like the same
00:31:29 so the four or five how hard is it to create something that could actually be a product that's deployed I mean I've
00:31:38 read an article or you on this respondent said something by you saying that to build autopilot is is more
00:31:50 complicated than a single George Hotz a level job how hard is that job to create something that would work across the
00:32:00 globe Lee what are the global ease the challenge but Elon followed that up by saying it's gonna take two years in a
00:32:05 company of ten people yeah and Here I am four years later with a company of twelve people and I think we still have
00:32:11 another two to go two years so yeah so what do you think what do you think about the hottest is progressing with
00:32:18 autopilot v2 v3 I think we've kept pace with them pretty well I think navigator autopilot is terrible
00:32:29 we had some demo features internally of the same stuff and we would test it and I'm like I'm not shipping this even as
00:32:35 like open-source software to people what do you think is do Consumer Reports does a great job of
00:32:40 describing it like when it makes a lane change it does it worse than a human you shouldn't ship things like autopilot
00:32:48 open pilot they Lane keep better than a human if you turn it on for a stretch of highway like an hour long it's never
00:32:57 gonna touch a lane line human will touch probably a lane line twice you just inspired me I don't know if you're
00:33:02 grounded and data on that I read labor okay but no but that's interesting  I wonder actually how often we touch Lane
00:33:12 lines in general like a little bit cuz it is okay I could answer that question pretty easily with the common data side
00:33:17 yeah I'm curious I've never answered it I don't know yeah I just - is like my person it feels right that's interesting
00:33:23 because every time you touch the lane that's the source of a little bit of stress and kind of lane-keeping is
00:33:29 removing that stress that's all to me the big the biggest value-add honestly is just removing the stress of having to
00:33:36 stay in lane and I think honestly I don't think people fully realize first of all that that's a big value add but
00:33:44 also that that's all it is and that not only I find it a huge value add I drove down when we moved to San
00:33:51 Diego I drove down our Enterprise rent-a-car and I missed it so I missed having the system so much it's so much
00:34:00 more tiring to drive without it it's it is that Lane centering that's the key feature yeah
00:34:09 and in a way it's the only feature that actually adds value to people's lives and autonomous vehicles today way mode
00:34:13 does not add value to people's lives it's a more expensive lower slower uber maybe someday it'll be this big cliff
00:34:19 where it adds value but I don't usually do this vessei I haven't talked to is that this is good because I haven't I
00:34:26 have intuitively but I think we're making it explicit now I I actually believe that really good lane-keeping is
00:34:37 a reason to buy a car will be a reason to buy a car is a huge value add I've never until we just started talking
00:34:42 about it haven't really quite realized that that I've felt with elan chase of level four is not the correct chase it
00:34:55 was on because you should just say Tesla has the best as if from a testing perspective say Tesla has the best
00:35:02 lane-keeping coming I should say coming I is the best link keeping and that is it yeah yeah does do you think well you
00:35:09 have to do the longitudinal as well you can't just Lane keep you have to do a cc but a cc is much more forgiving
00:35:16 than lanky especially on the highway oh by the way are you  calming eyes camera only correct oh no we use the
00:35:24 radar we from the car you were able to get to open it we can't do a camera only now it's gotten to the point but we
00:35:31 leave the radar there is like a it's it's fusion now okay so let's maybe talk through some of the system specs on the
00:35:39 hardware or what it what's what's the hardware side of what you're providing what's the capabilities in the software
00:35:47 side would open pilot and so on so open pilot as the the box that we sell that it runs on it's a phone in a plastic
00:35:55 case it's nothing special we sell it without the software so you're like you know you buy the phone it's just easy
00:36:01 it'll be easy setup but it's sold with no software open pilot right now is about to be 0.6
00:36:08 when it gets to 1.0 I think we'll be ready for a consumer product we're not gonna add any new features we're just
00:36:13 gonna make the lane-keeping really really good so what do we have right now it's a
00:36:19 snapdragon 820 say so many IMX 298 forward-facing camera driver monitoring camera and
00:36:29 she's a selfie cam on the phone and a can transceiver biffle's little thing calls pandas and they talk over USB to
00:36:37 the phone and then they have three canvases that they talk to the car one of those campuses is the radar CANbus
00:36:44 one of them is the main car CANbus and the other one is the proxy camera CANbus we leave the existing camera in place so
00:36:51 we don't turn a DB off right now we still turn a TV off if you're using our longitudinal but we're gonna fix that
00:36:57 before 1.0 you got it wow that's cool so in its can both way so how are you able to control vehicles so we proxy the
00:37:07 vehicles that we work with already have Lane Keeping Assist system so Lane Keeping Assist can mean a huge variety
00:37:15 of things it can mean it will apply a small torque to the wheel after you've already crossed a lane line by a foot
00:37:23 which is the system in the older Toyotas versus like I think Tesla still calls it Lane Keeping Assist where it'll keep you
00:37:30 perfectly in the center of the lane on the highway you can control like you would in joystick the cars these so
00:37:36 these cars already have the capability of drive-by-wire so is it is it trivial to convert a car that it operates with
00:37:46 it open pile is able to control the steering Oh a new car or a car that we so we have support now for 45 different
00:37:53 makes of cars what are one of the cars general mostly Hondas and Toyotas we support almost every Honda and Toyota
00:38:03 made this year and then a bunch of GM's bunch of Subarus which it doesn't have to be like a Prius it could be Coral as
00:38:09 well okay the 2020 Corolla is the best car with open pilot it just came out there the actuator has less lag than the
00:38:14 older Corolla I think I started watching video with your eye the way you make videos is
00:38:23 awesome literally the dealerships streaming stream for an hour yeah and basically like if stuff goes a
00:38:32 little wrong you're just like you just go with it yeah I love it what's real yeah that's real that's that's it's
00:38:39 that's so beautiful and it's so in contrast to the way other companies would put together a video like that how
00:38:47 do I like to do it like good I mean if you become super rich one day is successful I hope you keep it that way
00:38:52 because I think that's actually what people love that kind of genuine oh it's all that has value to me yeah my money
00:38:59 has no if I sell out to like make money and I sold out it doesn't matter what do I get yacht I don't I got and I think
00:39:09 Tesla's actually has a small inkling of that as well with autonomy day they did reveal more than I mean of course
00:39:15 there's marketing communications you can tell but it's more than most companies will reveal which is I hope they go
00:39:22 towards a direction more other companies GM Ford oh Jessa Tesla's gonna win level 5 they really are so let's talk about it
00:39:31 you think you're focused on level 2 currently currently we're gonna be one to two years behind Tesla getting to
00:39:39 level five okay we're interested right we're into it you're in I'm just saying once Tesla gets it we're one to two
00:39:43 years behind I'm not making any timeline on when Tesla's that's right you did that's brilliant
00:39:48 I'm sorry Tesla investors if you think you're gonna have an autonomous robot taxi fleet by the end of the year yes
00:39:55 that's all bet against that so that what do you think about this the most level four companies are kind of just doing
00:40:07 their usual safety driver during full autonomy kind of testing and then Tesla does basically trying to go from
00:40:15 lane-keeping to full autonomy what do you think about that approach how successful would it be a ton better
00:40:22 approach because Tesla is gathering data on a scale that none of them are they're putting real users behind the behind the
00:40:28 wheel of the car it's I think the only strategy that works the incremental well so there's a
00:40:37 few components to test approach that's that's more than just incrementally you spoke with is the one is the software so
00:40:44 over-the-air software updates necessity I mean way more ease have those - those aren't but there was differentiating
00:40:50 from the automaker's right no link keeping assist systems have no cars with lane keeping system have that except
00:40:57 Tesla yeah and the other one is the data the other direction which is the ability to query the data I don't think they're
00:41:04 actually collecting as much days people think but the ability to turn on collection and turn it off so I'm both
00:41:12 in the robotics world in the the psychology human factors world many people believe that level to autonomy is
00:41:19 problematic because of the human factor like the more the task is automated the more there's a vigilance decrement you
00:41:27 start to fall asleep you start to become complacent start texting more and so on do you worry about that
00:41:33 because if we're talking about transition from lane-keeping to full autonomy if you're spending eighty
00:41:42 percent of the time not supervising machine do you worry about what that means to the safety of the drivers one
00:41:49 we don't consider open pilot to be 1.0 until we have 100% driver monitoring you you can cheat right now our driver
00:41:55 monitoring system there's a few ways to cheat it there pretty obvious we're working on making that better before we
00:42:01 ship a consumer product that can drive cars I want to make sure that I have driver monitoring that you can't cheat
00:42:06 what's like a successful driver monitoring system look like it's keep its is it all buzz just keeping your
00:42:13 eyes on the road well a few things so that's what we went with it first for driver monitoring I'm checking I'm
00:42:18 actually looking at where your head is looking but cameras know about my resolution eyes are a little bit hard to
00:42:23 get well head is this big I mean that is good and actually a lot of it just as psychology wise to have that monitor
00:42:31 constantly there it reminds you that you have to be paying attention but we want to go further we just hired someone
00:42:37 full-time to come onto the driver monitoring I want to detect phone in frame and I want to make sure you're not sleeping
00:42:44 how much does the camera see of the body this one not enough not enough the next one everything
00:42:52 what's interesting fish Atkins we have we're doing just data collection that real-time but fish eye is a beautiful
00:42:59 mouth being able to capture the body and the smartphone is really like the biggest problem I'll show you I can show
00:43:05 you one of the pictures from from our finder system awesome so you're basically saying the
00:43:12 driver monitoring will be the answer to that I think the other point that the original paper is is good as well you're
00:43:19 not asking a human to supervise a machine without giving them meat they can take over at a time right our safety
00:43:26 model you can take over we disengage on both the gas or the brake we don't disengage on steering I don't feel you
00:43:31 have to but we disengage on gas or brake so it's very easy for you to take over and it's very easy for you to re-engage
00:43:38 that switching should be super cheap yeah the cars that require even autopilot requires a double press that's
00:43:44 almost I said I like that yeah and then then the cancel to cancel in autopilot you either have to press
00:43:49 cancel which no one knows where that is so they press the brake but a lot of things you don't you want to press the
00:43:54 brake you want present ass so you should cancel on gas or wiggle the steering wheel which is bad as well
00:43:59 wow that's brilliant I haven't heard anyone articulate at that point I like what this is all I think about
00:44:07 it's because I think I think actually Tesla has done a better job than most automakers at making that frictionless
00:44:14 but you just described that it could be even better I love super cruise as an experience once it's engaged yeah I
00:44:22 don't know if you've used it but getting the thing to try to engage him yeah I've used this of Germany's super cruise a
00:44:28 lot so what's their thoughts on the super Cruiser system in June disengage super cruise and it falls back to ACC so
00:44:34 my car's like still accelerating it feels weird otherwise when you actually have super cruise engaged on the highway
00:44:42 it is phenomenal we bought that Cadillac we just sold it but we bought it just to like experience this and I wanted
00:44:47 everyone in the office to be like this is what we're striving to build GM pioneering with the driver monitoring
00:44:53 you know you like their driver monitoring system it has some bugs if there's a sun shining back year it'll
00:45:03 be blind to you by overall mostly yeah that's so cool you know the stuff that's  I don't often talk to people that
00:45:09 because it's such a rare car unfortunately they bought one yes possibly for us we lost like by 25k the
00:45:15 deprecation but a Philips worth it I was very pleasantly surprised that GM system was so innovative and really that
00:45:26 wasn't advertised much wasn't talked about much yeah and I was nervous that it would die that they would disappear
00:45:33 my eyes did they put it on the wrong car they should've put it on the bolt and not some weird Cadillac that nobody
00:45:38 bought I think that's gonna be into they're saying at least is going to be into their entire fleet so what do you
00:45:44 think about it if as long as we're on the driver monitoring what do you think about you know I must claim that driver
00:45:52 monitoring is not needed normally I love his claims that one is stupid that one is stupid and you know he's not
00:46:00 gonna have his level five fleet by the end of the year hopefully he's like okay I was wrong I'm gonna add driver
00:46:07 monitoring because when these systems get to the point that they're only messing up once every thousand miles
00:46:14 you absolutely need driver monitor so let me play Delta because I agree with you but let me play devil's advocate so
00:46:21 one possibility is that without driver monitoring people are able to monitor the self-regulate monitor themselves you
00:46:31 know that so your idea is seeing all the people sleeping in decimals  yeah well I'm a little skeptical of all the people
00:46:42 sleeping in Tesla's because I have I've stopped paying attention to that kind of stuff because I want to see real data
00:46:47 there's too much glorified it doesn't feel scientific to me so I want to know you know what how many people are really
00:46:55 sleeping in Tesla's vs. sleeping I've I was driving here sleep-deprived in a car with no automation I was falling asleep
00:47:02 I agree that it's high P it's just like you know what if you under I've am wondering I think I rented a my last
00:47:09 autopilot experience was I rented a model three in march and drove it around the wheel thing is annoying and the reason
00:47:15 the wheel thing is annoying we use the wheel thing as well but we don't disengage on wheel for Tesla you have to
00:47:21 touch the wheel just enough you should trigger the torque sensor to tell it that you're there but not enough as to
00:47:29 disengage it which don't use it for two things you disengage one wheel you don't have to that whole experience Wow beautiful
00:47:36 put that all those elements even if you don't have driver monitoring that whole experience needs to be better driver
00:47:44 monitoring I think would make I mean I think super cruise is a better experience once it's engaged over autopilot
00:47:50 I think super cruise is our transition to engagement and disengagement are significantly worse yeah so there's a
00:47:57 tricky thing because if I were to criticize super cruise is  it's a little too crude and  I think it's
00:48:03 like six seconds or something if you look off-road you'll start warning you it's some ridiculously long period of
00:48:13 time and just the way it I think it's basically it's a binary chili adapter it yeah it's it just needs to learn more
00:48:21 about you and used to communicate what it sees about you more like I'm not you know Tesla shows what it sees about the
00:48:27 external world it would be nice the supercruise would tell us what it sees about the internal world it's even worse
00:48:33 than that you press the button to engage and it just says super cruise unavailable yeah why why yeah that
00:48:42 transparency is good we've renamed the driver monitoring packet to driver state service state we have car state packet
00:48:48 which has the state of the car driver state packet which I stay the driver so what does itah make their BAC
00:48:58 must be do you think that's possible with computer vision absolutely so to me it's an open question I don't haven't
00:49:07 looked into too much they actually had quite seriously looked at the literature it's not obvious to me that from the
00:49:11 eyes and so on you can tell you might need to stuff from the car as well yeah you might need how they're controlling
00:49:16 the car right and that's fundamentally at the end of the day what you care about you but I think especially when
00:49:21 people are really drunk they're not controlling the car nearly smoothly as they would look at them
00:49:26 walking right there the car is like an extension of the body so I think you could totally detect and if you could
00:49:31 fix people who drunk distracted asleep if you fix those three yeah this is that's huge so what are the current
00:49:38 limitations of open pilot what are the main problems that still need to be solved we're hopefully fixing a few
00:49:46 of them in 0-6 we're not as good as auto pilot at stop cars so if you're coming up to a red light at like 55 so it's the
00:49:57 radar stopped car problem which is responsible to auto pilot accidents it's hard to differentiate a stopped car from
00:50:05 a like signpost yes that ecology so you have to fuse you have to do this visually there's no way from the radar
00:50:09 data to tell the difference maybe you could make a map but I really believe in mapping at all anymore really what
00:50:17 you don't believe in mapping no so you basically the open pilot solution is saying react to the environment is just
00:50:24 like human doing beings and then eventually when you want to do navigate on open pilot I'll train the net to look
00:50:31 at ways all runways in the background I'll train a car using GPS at all we use it to crown trees we use it to very
00:50:38 carefully ground treat the paths we have a stack which can recover a relative to 10 centimeters over one minute and then
00:50:44 we use that to ground truth exactly where the car went in that local part of the environment but it's all local how
00:50:50 are you testing in general just for yourself like experiments stuff all right were you were you located San
00:50:58 Diego San Diego yeah okay Oh what you basically drive around there then collect some data and watch on Florence
00:51:04 we have a simulator now and we have our simulators really cool our simulator is not it's not like a unity based
00:51:11 simulator our simulator lets us load in real estate what I mean we can load in a drive and simulate what the system would
00:51:20 have done on the historical data ooh nice interesting so what yeah right now we're only using it for testing but as
00:51:29 soon as we start using it for training what's your feeling about the real world versus simulation do you like simulation
00:51:35 for training if this moves to training Chuck we have to distinguish two types of simulators right there's a simulator
00:51:44 that light is completely fake I could get my car to drive around in GTA mm-hmm I feel that this kind of simulator is
00:51:54 useless you're never there's so many my analogy here is like okay fine you're not solving the computer vision problem
00:52:01 but you're solving the computer graphics problem right and you don't think you can get very far about creating ultra
00:52:09 realistic graphics no because you can create ultra realistic graphics of the road now create alter a realistic
00:52:14 behavioral models of the other cars oh well I'll just use my self-driving no you won't you need real you need actual
00:52:22 human behavior because that's what you're trying to learn the dead driving does not have a spec the definition of
00:52:28 driving is what humans do when they drive whatever way mode does I don't think it's driving right well I think if
00:52:36 you win more than others its if there's any useful reinforcement learning I've seen it used quite well I study
00:52:42 pedestrians a lot too is try to train models from real data of how pedestrians move and try to use reinforcement
00:52:48 learning models to make pedestrians move in human-like ways by that point you've already gone so many layers you detected
00:52:57 a pedestrian did you did you hand code the feature vector of their state did you guys learn anything from computer
00:53:05 vision before deep learning well okay you know I feel like this is a perception to you is the sticking point
00:53:12 does that mean what what's what's the hardest part of the stack here there is no human understandable feature vector
00:53:22 separating perception and planning that's the best way I can I can put that there is no so it's all together and
00:53:29 it's it's a that's a joint problem so you can take localization localization and planning there is a human
00:53:34 understandable feature vector between these two things I mean okay so I have like three degrees position three
00:53:39 degrees orientation and those derivatives maybe those second derivatives right that's human
00:53:44 understandable that's physical the between perception and planning so like way Moe has a perception
00:53:54 stack and then a planner and one of the things way matters right is they have a simulator that can separate those
00:54:02 two they can like replay their perception data and test their system which is what I'm talking about about
00:54:05 like the two different kinds of simulators there's the kind that can work on real data and is the kind of
00:54:12 can't work on real data now the problem is that I don't think you can hand code a feature vector right like like you
00:54:17 have some lists of like well here's my list of cars on the scenes here's my list of pedestrians in the scene this
00:54:23 isn't what humans are doing what are humans doing global some something you're saying that's too difficult to
00:54:33 handle I'm saying that there is no state vector given a perfect I could give you the best team of engineers in the world
00:54:38 to build a perception system and the best team to build a planner all you have to do is define the state vector
00:54:45 that separates those two I'm missing the state vector that separates those two what do you mean so what is the output
00:54:53 of your perception system I'll put it the perception system it's theirs okay well there's several ways to
00:55:03 do it one is this lamp components localization the other is drivable area drivable space drivable space and then
00:55:08 there's the different objects in the scene and different objects in the scene over time maybe to give you input to
00:55:19 then try to start modeling the trajectories of those objects sure that's it I can give you a concrete
00:55:25 example of something you missed what's that so say there's a bush in the scene humans understand that when they see
00:55:32 this bush that there may or may not be a car behind that bush drivable area and a list of objects does not include that
00:55:39 humans are doing this constantly at the simplest intersections so now you have to talk about occluded area right right
00:55:46 but even that what do you mean by occluded okay so I can't see it well if it's the other side of a house I don't
00:55:53 care what's the likelihood that there's a car in that occluded area right and if you say okay we'll add that I can come
00:55:59 up with 10 more examples that you can't add certainly occluded area would be something that simulator would have
00:56:07 because it's simulating the entire you know occlusion is part of it a part of a vision stack pleasures that what I'm
00:56:15 saying is if you have a hand engineered if your perception system output can be written in a spec document it is
00:56:24 incomplete yeah idem you know certainly it's it's hard to argue with that because in the end that's going to be
00:56:31 true yes I'll tell you what the output of our perception system is was that it's a thousand it's a thousand twenty
00:56:37 four dimensional vector training underling oh no not it's a thousand twenty four dimensions of who knows what because its
00:56:46 operating on real data yeah yeah and that's the perception that's the perception stake right think about a
00:56:52 think about an autoencoder four phases alright if you have an autoencoder four phases and you say it has 256 dimensions
00:57:00 in middle and I'm taking a face over here and projecting it to a face over here yeah can you hand label all 256 of
00:57:05 those dimensions well no but those are generated automatically but they but even if you
00:57:12 tried to do it by hand could you come up with a spec for your and between your encoder and your decoder
00:57:19 no no because that's not it is it wasn't designed but there no no but if you could design it if you could design a
00:57:27 face Reconstructor system could you come up with a spec no but I think we're missing here a little bit I think the
00:57:35 the you're just being very poetic about expressing a fundamental problem of simulators that they're going to be
00:57:44 missing so much that the feature vector would just look fundamentally different from in the simulated world in the real
00:57:52 world I'm not making a claim about simulators I'm making a claim about the spec division between perception and
00:57:59 planning and planning even in your system just in general right just in general if you're trying to build a car
00:58:06 that drives if you're trying to hand code the output of your perception system like saying like here's a list of
00:58:11 all the cars in the scene here's a list of all the people here's a list of the included areas here's a vector of
00:58:15 drivable areas insufficient and if you start to believe that you realize that what Wayman crews
00:58:21 are doing is impossible currently what we're doing is the perception problem it's converting the scene into a
00:58:30 chessboard you yeah and then you reason some basic reasoning around that chessboard yeah and you're saying that
00:58:38 really there's a lot missing there first of all why are we talking about this cuz isn't this a full autonomy is this
00:58:45 something you think about oh I want to win self-driving cars so you're really your definition of win includes level of
00:58:54 fool five level five I don't think level four is a real thing I want to build I want to build the alphago of driving so
00:59:06 so alphago is really end to end yeah is  yeah it's end to end and do you think this whole problem is those that also
00:59:14 kind of what you're getting at with the perception and the planning is that this whole problem the right way to do it is
00:59:21 really to learn the entire thing I'll argue that not only is it the right way it's the only way that's going to exceed
00:59:29 human performance well certainly true for go everyone who tried to hand code go things built human inferior things
00:59:34 and then someone came along and wrote some 10,000 line thing that doesn't know anything about go that beat everybody
00:59:43 it's 10,000 lines true in that sense the the open question then that maybe I can ask you is  driving is much harder
00:59:54 than go the open question is how much harder so how because I think the AH mosque approach here with planning and
01:00:01 perception it's similar to what you're describing which is really turning into not some kind of modular thing but
01:00:10 really do formulate is a learning problem and it solves a learning problem of scale so how many years put one is
01:00:18 how many years would it take to solve this problem or just how hard is this freaking problem well the cool thing is
01:00:28 I think there's a lot of value that we can deliver along the way I think that you can build lane-keeping assist
01:00:39 actually plus adaptive cruise control plus okay looking at ways extends to like all of driving yeah most of driving varies
01:00:49 oh your adaptive cruise control treats red lights like cars okay so let's jump around with you you
01:00:54 mentioned that you didn't like navigate an autopilot yeah what advice how would you make it better
01:00:59 do you think as a feature that if it's done really well it's a good feature I think that it's too reliant on like hand
01:01:08 coded hacks for like how does navigate an autopilot do a lane change it actually does the same lane change every
01:01:14 time and it feels mechanical humans do different lane changes human sometime will do a slow one sometimes do a fast
01:01:20 one navigate an autopilot at least every time I used it it did the identical language how do you learn I mean this is
01:01:26 a fundamental thing actually yeah is  the braking and an accelerating something that's still test the probably
01:01:34 does it better than most cars but it still doesn't do a great job of creating a comfortable natural experience and
01:01:42 navigate on autopilot just lane changes an extension of that so how do you learn to do natural lane change so we have it
01:01:53 and I can talk about how it works so I feel that we have the solution for lateral but we don't yet have the
01:02:01 solution for longitudinal there's a few reasons longitudinal is harder than lateral the lane change component the
01:02:07 way that we train on it very simply is like our model has an input for whether it's doing a lane change or not and then
01:02:16 when we train the end-to-end model we hand label all the lane changes because you have to I struggled a long time
01:02:22 about not wanting to do that but I think you have to because you order the training data for the train data right
01:02:27 well we actually we have an automatic ground truth or which automatically labels all the lane changes was that
01:02:32 possible to automatically label interest yeah and detect the lane I see when it crosses it right I don't have to get
01:02:36 that that high percent accuracy but it's like 95 good enough now I set the bit when it's doing the
01:02:44 lane change in the end-to-end learning and then I set it to zero when it's not doing a lane change so now if I wanted
01:02:49 to do a lane change a test time I just put the bit to a 1 and I'll do later yeah but so if you look at the space of
01:02:56 lane change you know some percentage not a hundred percent that we make as humans is not a pleasant experience because we
01:03:03 messed some part of it up yeah it's nerve-racking to change even look at the seizure des accelerate how do we label
01:03:09 the ones that are natural and feel good you know that's the because that's your ultimate criticism the current Oh
01:03:16 navigate not apologies doesn't feel good well the current navigator on autopilot is a hand coded policy written by an
01:03:22 engineer in a room who probably went out and tested it a few times on the 280 probably a more a better version of that
01:03:30 but yes that's how we would have written it a comment yeah Tesla they tested it and it might have been two engineers
01:03:39 yeah no but so if you learn the lane change if you learn how to do a lane change from data just like just like you
01:03:44 have a label that says lane change and then you put it in when you want to do the lane change it'll automatically do
01:03:50 the lane change that's appropriate for the situation now to get it the problem of some humans do bad lane changes we
01:03:59 haven't worked too much on this problem yet it's not that much of a problem in practice my theory is that all good
01:04:06 drivers are good in the same way and all bad drivers are bad in different ways and we've we've seen some data to back
01:04:12 this up well beautifully put so you just basically if that's true yeah hypothesis then you know task is to discover the
01:04:21 good drivers the good drivers stand out because they're in one cluster and the bad drivers are scattered all over
01:04:25 the place and your net learns the cluster yeah that's  so you just learned from the good
01:04:33 drivers and they're easy to cluster we learned from all of them and that automatically learns the policy that's
01:04:37 like the majority but we'll eventually probably afterthought so if that theory is true I hope it's true because the the
01:04:48 maybe but rarely many clusters of good drivers because if there's one cluster of good
01:04:57 drivers you can at least discover a set of policies you can learn a set of policies which would be good universally
01:05:03 yeah that would be a nice that would be nice if it's true and you're saying that there are some evidence that let's say
01:05:09 lane changes can be clustered into four clusters right right there's this finite level of I would argue that all four of
01:05:15 those are good clusters all the things that are random are noise and probably bad and which one of the four you pick
01:05:21 or maybe it's Tanner maybe it's twenty you can learn them it's context dependent it depends on the scene and
01:05:29 the hope is it's not too dependent on the driver yeah the hope is that it all washes out
01:05:35 the hope is that there's that the distribution is not bimodal the hope is that it's a nice gas man so what advice
01:05:42 would you give to Tessa how to fix how to improve navigate an autopilot the lessons you've learned from Kamiya
01:05:49 the only real advice I would give to Tesla is please put driver monitoring in your cars with respect to improvement
01:05:56 you can't do that anymore I said to interrupt but you know there's a practical nature of many of hundreds of
01:06:02 thousands of cars being produced that don't have a good driver facing camera the model 3 has a selfie cam is it not
01:06:09 good enough did they not have put IR LEDs for night that's a good question but I do know that the is fisheye in its
01:06:16 relatively low resolution so it's really not this I he wasn't it wasn't designed for Arman you can
01:06:21 hope that you can kind of scrape up and and and have something from it yeah but put it in today put it in today today
01:06:30 every time I've heard Carpathia talk about the problem and talking about life software 2.0 and how the machine
01:06:35 learning is gobbling up everything I think this is absolutely the right strategy I think that he didn't write
01:06:40 navigate on autopilot I think somebody else did and kind of hacked it on top of that stuff I think what Carpathia says
01:06:46 wait a second why did we hand code this lane change policy with all these magic numbers we're gonna learn it from data
01:06:50 they'll fix it they already know what to do there well that that's that's Andres job is to turn everything into a
01:06:56 learning problem and collect a huge amount of data the the reality is though not every problem could be turned into a
01:07:03 learning problem in the short term in the end everything would be a learning problem
01:07:10 the reality is like if you want to build alpha vehicles today it will likely involve no learning and that's that's
01:07:18 the the reality is so at which point does learning start it's the crutch statement that lidar is a crutch
01:07:25 on which point will learning get up to part of human performance it's all over human performance and imagenet
01:07:32 classification under ivan is the question still it is a question I'll say this I'm I'm here to play for 10 years
01:07:40 I'm not here to try to I'm here to play for 10 years and make money along the way I'm not here to try to promise
01:07:46 people that I'm gonna have my l5 taxi Network up and working in two years do you think those mistake yes what do you
01:07:52 think there was the motivation behind saying that other companies are also promising alpha vehicles with their
01:08:01 different approaches in 2020 2021 2022 if anybody would like to bet me that those things do not pan out I will I
01:08:08 will bet you even money even money I'll bet you as much as you want so are you worried about what's going to happen
01:08:15 because you're not in full agreement on that I was going to happen when 2022 21 come around and nobody has fleets of
01:08:23 autonomous vehicles no you can look at the history if you go back five years ago they were all promised by 2018 and
01:08:31 2017 but they weren't that strong of promises I mean Ford really declared pretty that I think not many have
01:08:40 declared as as like definitively as they have now these dates well okay so let's separate l4 and l5 do I think that it's
01:08:49 possible for way mo to continue to kind of like like hack on their system until it gets to level 4 in Chandler Arizona
01:08:57 yes knows no safety driver Chandler Arizona yeah but by OSI which year are we talking about
01:09:04 oh I even think that's possible by like 2020 2021 but level 4 Chandler Arizona not level 5 New York City level 4
01:09:16 meaning some very defined streets it works out really well very defined streets and then
01:09:21 these streets are pretty empty if most of the streets are covered in way MOS we mo can kind of change the definition of
01:09:29 what driving is right if your self-driving network is the majority of cars in an area they only need to be
01:09:35 safe with respect to each other and all the humans will need to learn to adapt to them now go drive in downtown New York
01:09:44 oh yeah that's already you can talk about autonomy in like like fun farms it already works great because you can
01:09:51 really just follow the GPS line so what does success look like for comm AI what what are the milestones like where you
01:10:00 can sit back with some champagne and say we did it boys and girls well it's never over yeah but don't be
01:10:09 let's drink champagne everything straight so what is a good what are some wins a big milestone that we're
01:10:19 hoping for by mid next year is profitability of the company and we're gonna have to revisit the idea of
01:10:30 selling a consumer product but it's not gonna be like the comma one when we do it it's gonna be perfect
01:10:38 open pilot has gotten so much better in the last two years we're gonna have a few a few features we're gonna have a
01:10:43 hundred percent driver monitoring we're gonna disable no safety features in the car actually I think it'd be really
01:10:49 cool we're doing right now our project this week is we're analyzing the data set and looking for all the AEP triggers
01:10:55 from the manufacturer systems we have a better data set on that than the manufacturers how much does how many
01:11:02 does Toyota have ten million miles of real-world driving to know how many times they're AUB triggered so let me
01:11:07 give you cuz yes right financial advice yeah cuz I work with a lot of automakers and one possible
01:11:16 source of money for you which I'll be excited to see you take on is basically selling the data so which is something
01:11:30 that most people are not selling in a way we're here here at automaker but creating we've done this actually at MIT
01:11:36 not for money purposes but you could do it for significant money purposes and make the world a better place by
01:11:42 creating a consortium where automakers would pay in and then they get to have free access to the data and I I think a
01:11:51 lot of people are really hungry for that and would pay significant amount of money for it here's the problem with
01:11:56 that I like this idea all in theory he'd be very easy for me to give them access to my servers and we already have all
01:12:02 open source tools to access this data it's in a great format we have a great pipeline but they're gonna put me in the
01:12:08 room with some business development guy mm-hmm and I'm gonna have to talk to this guy and he's not gonna know most of
01:12:15 the words I'm saying I'm not willing to tolerate that okay but I think I agree with you I'm the same way but you just
01:12:23 tell them the terms and there's no discussion needed if if I could just tell them the terms yeah and then like
01:12:31 all right who wants access to my data I will sell it to you for let's say you want to go on a subscription I'll sell
01:12:42 you 400 a month any 100k mo 100k month I'll give you access to the data subscription yeah yeah I think that's
01:12:47 kind of fair came up with that number off the top of my head if somebody sends me like a three line email where it's
01:12:52 like we would like to pay a hundred K month to get access to your data we would agree to like reasonable privacy
01:12:57 terms of the people who are in the data set I would be happy to do it but that's not gonna be the email the email is
01:13:03 gonna be hey do you have some time in the next month where we can sit down and we can I don't have time for that we're
01:13:08 moving too fast yeah you could politely respond to that email but not saying I don't have any time for your
01:13:14 yeah you say oh well unfortunately these are the terms and so this is we try to we brought the cost down for you in
01:13:21 order to minimize the friction of education after here's the whatever it is 1 2 million years dollars a year and
01:13:30 you have access and it's not like I get that email from like but okay am I gonna reach out am I gonna hire a business
01:13:34 development person who's gonna reach out to the automaker's no way yeah okay if they reached into me I'm not gonna
01:13:41 ignore the email I'll come back with something straight yeah if you're willing just pay honeycomb all the facts
01:13:45 they don't man I'm happy to to set that up that's what my engineering time but actually quite
01:13:50 insightful view you're right yeah probably because many of the automakers are quite a bit of old-school yeah there
01:13:57 will be need to reach out and they want it but they they'll need to be some some communication you right mobile eye
01:14:04 circuit 2015 had the lowest R&D spend of any chip maker like purpur and you look at all the people who work for them and
01:14:11 it's all business development people because the car companies are impossible to work with yeah so you're you have no
01:14:18 patience for that and you're you're legit Android huh I have something to do right like like it's not like it's not
01:14:23 like I don't like I don't mean to like be a dick and say like I don't have patience for that but it's like that
01:14:28 stuff doesn't help us with our goal of winning self-driving cars if I want money in the short term if I showed off
01:14:37 like the actual like the learning tech that we have it's it's somewhat sad like it's years and years ahead of everybody
01:14:43 else's not so maybe not Tesla's I think Tesla has similar stuff to us actually yeah I think Tesla's similar stuff but
01:14:48 when you compare it to like what the Toyota Research Institute has you're not even close to what we have no comment
01:14:56 but I also can't I have to take your comments I ain't into ative Lee believe you but I have to take it with a grain
01:15:05 of salt because I mean you you are an inspiration because you basically don't care about a lot of things that other
01:15:13 companies care about you don't try to in a sense like make up stuff so to drive a valuation you're really
01:15:20 very real and you're trying to solve the problem and admire that a lot what I don't necessarily fully can't trust you
01:15:27 on I do respect it's like how good it is right I can only but I also know how bad others are and so I'll say I'll say two
01:15:35 things about don't trust but verify right I'll say two things about that one is try get in a twenty twenty Corolla
01:15:44 and try open pal 0.6 when it comes out next month I think already you'll look at this and you'll be like them this is
01:15:52 already really good and then I could be doing that all with hand labelers and all with with like like the same
01:15:58 approach that like Mobileye uses when we release a model that no law has the lanes in it that only outputs a
01:16:04 path mm-hmm then think about how we did that machine learning and then right away when you
01:16:11 see and that's gonna be an open pilot that's gonna be an open pilot before 1.0 when you see that model you'll know that
01:16:15 everything I'm saying is true because how else did I get that model good one of the things too about the simulator oh
01:16:20 yeah yeah this is super exciting that's super exciting and  but like you know I listened to your talk with Kyle and
01:16:28 Kyle was originally building the the after market system and he gave up on it because of technical challenges yeah
01:16:37 because of the fact that he's gonna have to support twenty to fifty cars we support forty five because what is he
01:16:42 gonna do when the manufacturer ABS system triggers we have alerts and warnings to deal with all of that in all
01:16:47 the cars and how is he going to formally verify it well I got ten million miles of data it's probably better it's
01:16:52 probably better verified than the spec yeah I'm glad you're here talking to me this is I'll remember this day is this
01:17:02 interesting if you look at Kyle's from from Cruz I'm sure they have a large number of business development folks and
01:17:10 you work with he's working with GM you could work with agro a I working with Ford it's interesting because chances
01:17:18 that you fail business-wise like bankrupt are pretty high yeah and and yet it's the Android model is you're
01:17:26 actually taking on the problem so that's really inspiring I mean well I have a long-term way for kamma to make money
01:17:32 too and one of the nice things when you really take on the problem which is my hope for autopilot for example is things
01:17:40 you don't expect ways to make money or create value that you don't expect will pop up oh I've known how to do it
01:17:47 since kind of 2017 is the first time I said it well which part to know it to know how to do which part our long-term
01:17:52 plan is to be a car insurance company insurance yeah I love it yeah yeah what I make driving twice is safe not only
01:17:57 that I have the best date is that you know who statistically is the safest drivers and oh oh we see you we see you
01:18:04 driving unsafely we're not going to insure you and that that causes a like bifurcation in the market because the
01:18:10 only people who can't get common insurance or the bad drivers Geico can insure them their premiums
01:18:14 crazy higher premiums are crazy low would win contracts take over that whole market okay so if we win if we went but
01:18:22 that's I'm saying like how do you turn comma into a ten billion dollar company is that that's right
01:18:30 so you you know a musk who else who else is thinking like this and working like this in your view who are the
01:18:36 competitors are there people seriously I don't think anyone that I'm aware of as seriously taking on lane-keeping you
01:18:45 know like to worse a huge business that turns eventually into full autonomy that then creates yeah like that creates
01:18:53 other businesses on top of it and so on thinks insurance thinks all kinds of ideas like that do you know who anyone
01:19:01 else thinking like this not really that's interesting I mean it my sense is everybody turns to that in like four or
01:19:09 five years like Ford once the autonomy doesn't feel fall through but at this time Elon to the iOS by the way he paved
01:19:17 the way for all I was not i OS true I would not be doing comma AI today if it was not for those conversations with
01:19:25 Elon and if it were not for him saying like yeah I think he said like well obviously we're not gonna use Leiter we
01:19:31 use cameras humans use cameras so what do you think about that how important is lidar everybody else is on l5 is using
01:19:37 lidar what are your thoughts on his provocative statement that lidar is a crutch see sometimes we'll say dumb
01:19:44 things like the driver monitoring thing but sometimes we'll say absolutely completely 100% obviously true things
01:19:50 yeah of course lidar is a crutch it's not even a good crutch you're not even using it they're using it for
01:19:57 localization yeah which isn't good in the first place if you have to localize your car to centimetres in order to
01:20:04 drive like yeah they're not drive it currently not doing much machine learning I thought polite our data
01:20:10 meaning like to help you in the tasks of general tasks of perception the main goal of those light hours on those cars
01:20:17 I think is actually localization more than perception or at least that's what they use them for yeah that's true if
01:20:22 you want to localize two centimeters you can't use GPS the fanciest GPS in the world can't do it especially if you're
01:20:26 under tree cover and stuff flatter I can do it pretty easily see really they're not taking on I mean in
01:20:32 some research they're doing they're using it for perception but and they're certainly not which sad they're not
01:20:39 fusing it well lay vision they do use it for perception I'm not saying they don't use it for perception but the thing that
01:20:45 they have vision based and radar based perception systems as well you could remove the lidar and and and keep around
01:20:53 a lot of the dynamic object perception you want to get centimeter accurate localization good luck doing that with
01:21:01 anything else so what should Cruz lame-o do like what would you be your advice to them now anyway Mo's actually there's I
01:21:11 mean they're doing they're serious way mo out of all of them equate so serious about the long game if everybody fell
01:21:20 five is a lot is requires fifty years I think when will be the only one left standing at the end with the forgiving
01:21:26 the financial backing if they have Google box I'll say nice things about both lame-o and Cruz let's do it nice is
01:21:37 good way mo is by far the furthest along with technology way mo has a three to five year lead on all the competitors um
01:21:47 if that if the way mo looking stack works mm-hmm maybe three year lead if the way mo looking stack works they have
01:21:54 a three year lead now I argue that way mo has spent too much money to recapitalize to gain back their
01:22:00 losses in those three years also self-driving cars have no network effect like that yeah goober has a network
01:22:05 effect you have a market you have drivers and you have riders self-driving cars you have capital and you have
01:22:11 riders there's no network effect if I want to blanket a new city in self-driving cars i buy the
01:22:15 off-the-shelf Chinese knockoff self-driving cars and I buy enough up from the city I can't do that with
01:22:20 drivers and that's why Ober has a first mover advantage that no self-driving car company will can you  disentangle that
01:22:27 a little bit uber you're not talking about uber the autonomous vehicle number you talked about the uber cars okay yeah
01:22:34 I'm over I open for business in Austin Texas listen I need to attract both sides of the market I need to both get drivers
01:22:42 my platform and riders on my platinum and I need to keep them both sufficiently happy right riders aren't
01:22:47 going to use it if it takes more than five minutes for an uber to show up drivers aren't gonna use it if they have
01:22:51 to sit around all day and there's no riders so you have to carefully balance a market and whenever you have to
01:22:56 carefully balance a market there's a great first mover advantage because there's a switching cost for everybody
01:23:02 right the drivers and the riders would have to switch at the same time let's even say that you know let's say
01:23:10 Luber shows up in Luber somehow you know agrees to do things that add a bigger you know you know we're just gonna we've
01:23:18 done it more efficiently right Luber is only takes five percent of a cot instead of the ten percent that Hooper takes no
01:23:23 one is gonna switch because the switching cost is higher than that five percent so you actually can in markets
01:23:28 like that you have a first mover advantage yeah autonomous vehicles of the level five variety have no first
01:23:35 mover advantage if the technology becomes commoditized say I want to go to a new city look at the scooters it's
01:23:40 gonna look a lot more like scooters every person with a checkbook can blanket a city in scooters and that's
01:23:47 why you have 10 different scooter companies yeah which one's gonna win it's a race to the bottom it's terrible
01:23:51 market to begin because there's no market for scooters and scooters don't get a say and whether they want to be
01:23:58 bought and deployed to a city or not right so the yeah we're gonna entice the scooters with subsidies and deals so
01:24:05 whenever you have to invest that capital that's it doesn't it doesn't come back yeah that they can't be your main
01:24:11 criticism over the way mo approach oh I'm saying even if it does technically work even if it does technically work
01:24:19 that's a problem yeah I don't know I if I were to say I I would I would say you're already there I haven't even
01:24:25 thought about that but I would say the bigger challenge is the technical approach so way most cruises and not
01:24:33 just the technical approach but of creating value I still don't understand how you beat uber the the human driven
01:24:45 cars in terms of financially it doesn't it doesn't make sense to me that people want to want to get an autonomous
01:24:51 vehicle I don't understand how you make money in the long term like real long-term but it just feels
01:24:59 like there's too much capital investment needed oh and they're gonna be worse than ubers because they're gonna they're
01:25:03 gonna stop for every little you know thing everywhere actually a nice thing about Cruz that was my nice thing
01:25:09 about wait another three years that it wasn't nice oh that's three years technically ahead of everybody their
01:25:15 tech stack is is great my nice thing about Cruz is GM buying them was a great move for GM for 1 billion dollars GM
01:25:25 bought an insurance policy against way mo they put Cruz is three years behind way mo that means Google will get a
01:25:33 monopoly on the technology for at most three years and technology works you might not even be right about the
01:25:42 three years it might be less might be less crews actually might not be that far behind I don't know how much way mo
01:25:47 has waffled around or how much of it actually is just that long tail yeah okay if that's the best you could say
01:25:53 there's some nice things it that's more of a nice thing for GM that that's a smart insurance policy it's just more
01:26:00 insurance policy I mean I think that's how I I can't see crews working out any other for crews to leapfrog way mo would
01:26:11 really surprise me yeah so let's talk about like the underlying assumptions of everything is we're not going to
01:26:18 leapfrog Tesla Tesla would have to seriously mess up for us because you're okay so the way you leapfrog right is
01:26:26 you come up with an idea or you take a direction perhaps secretly that the other people aren't taking and so cruise
01:26:38 way mo even Aurora no Aurora tzuke's is the same stack as well they're all the same codebase even and they're all the
01:26:45 same DARPA urban challenge codebase so the question is do you think there's a room for brilliance and innovation
01:26:51 there that will change everything like say okay so I'll give you examples it could be if revolution and mapping for
01:27:03 example that allow you to map things do HD maps of the whole world all weather conditions really well or revolutionist simulation
01:27:17 to where the the what you said before becomes incorrect that kind of thing I knew room for breakthrough innovation um
01:27:26 what I said before about oh they actually get the whole thing well I'll say this about we divide driving into
01:27:33 three problems and I actually haven't solved the third yet but I have an idea how to do it so there's the static the
01:27:38 static driving problem is assuming you are the only car on the road right right and this problem can be solved 100% with
01:27:44 mapping and localization this is why farms work the way they do if all you have to deal with is the static problem
01:27:49 and you can statically schedule your machines right it's the same as like statically scheduling processes you can
01:27:54 statically schedule your tractors to never hit each other on their paths all right because then you know the speed
01:27:59 they go at so so that's the static driving problem Maps only helps you with the static driving problem yeah the
01:28:07 question about static driving yeah you just made it sound like it's really easy that was really easy how easy how well
01:28:16 because the whole drifting out of lane when when Tesla drifts out of lane is failing on the fundamental static
01:28:23 driving problem Tesla is drifting out of lane the static driving problem is not easy for the world the static driving
01:28:32 problem is easy for one route and one route in one weather condition with one state of lane markings and like no
01:28:41 deterioration no cracks in the road I'm assuming you have a perfect localizer so that's all for the weather condition and
01:28:45 me the lane marking condition that's the problem is how could you how do you have a perfect you can build perfect
01:28:49 localizers are not that hard to build okay come on now with with wood lighter why don't ya wood lighter okay yeah but
01:28:56 you use lighter right like use lidar build a perfect localizer building a perfect localizer without lidar it's
01:29:04 gonna be it's gonna be hard you can get ten centimeters without liner you can get one centimeter with lidar maybe
01:29:09 concern about the one or ten centimeter I'm concerned if every once in a while you're just way off yeah so this is why
01:29:18 you have to carefully make sure you're always tracking your position you want to use light
01:29:22 camera fusion but you can get the reliability of that system up to a hundred thousand miles and then you
01:29:30 write some fallback condition where it's not that bad if you're way off right I think that you can get it to the point
01:29:35 it's like özil D that you're you're never in a case where you're way off and you don't know it yeah okay so this is
01:29:42 brilliant so that's the static static we can especially with lidar and good HD maps you can solve that problem easy
01:29:52 no you just the static static very typical for you to say something's easy I got it it's not as challenging as the
01:29:57 other ones okay well it's okay maybe it's obvious how to solve it the third one's the hardest well where do we get
01:30:01 and a lot of people don't even think about the third one and even I see it as different from the second one so the
01:30:06 second one is dynamic the second one is like say there's an obvious examples like a car stopped at a red light
01:30:11 right you can't have that car in your map yeah because you don't know whether that car is gonna be there or not so you
01:30:17 have to detect that car in real time and then you have to you know do the appropriate action right also that car
01:30:25 is not a fixed object that car may move and you have to predict with that car will dim alright so this is the dynamic
01:30:31 problem yeah do you have to deal with this this involves again like you're gonna need models of other people's
01:30:39 behavior do you are you including in that and I don't want to step on on the third one oh but if I are you including
01:30:47 in that you're influenced and people I guess the third okay that's the moon we call it the counterfactual yeah I
01:30:53 believe that I just talked to Judea pearl who's obsessed with counterfactuals oh yeah yeah so the
01:31:01 static and the dynamic yeah our approach right now for lateral will scale completely to the static a dynamic
01:31:09 the counterfactual the only way I have to do it yet they don't give you thing that I want to do once we have all these
01:31:14 cars is I want to do reinforcement learning on the world I'm always gonna turn the exploiter up to max I'm not
01:31:20 gonna have them explore but the only real way to get at the counterfactual is to do reinforcement learning because the
01:31:28 other agents are humans so that's fascinating that you break you down like that I agree completely I've set my life
01:31:34 thinking about this beautiful they're so and part of it because you're slightly insane because not my life just
01:31:44 the last four years no no you have like some some nonzero percent of your brain has a madman in it which that's a really
01:31:54 good feature but there's a safety component to it that I think when this sort of counterfactuals and so on that
01:32:00 would just freak people out how do you even start to think about just in general I mean you've you've had some
01:32:08 friction with Nitza and so on I am frankly exhausted by safety engineers the the prioritization on safety over
01:32:22 innovation to a degree where it kills in my view kills safety in the long term so the counterfactual thing they just just
01:32:31 actually exploring this world of how do you interact with dynamic objects and so on how do you how do you think about
01:32:36 safety you can do reinforcement learning without ever exploring and I said that like so you can think about you're in
01:32:41 like a reinforcement learning it's usually called like a temperature parameter and your temperature parameter
01:32:47 is how often you deviate from the Arg max I could always set that to zero and still learn and I feel that you'd always
01:32:53 want that set to zero on your actual system got you but the problem is you first don't know very much and so you're
01:33:00 going to make mistakes so the learning the exploration happens to ready yeah but okay so the consequences of a
01:33:07 mistake yeah open pilot and autopilot are making mistakes left and right yeah we have we have we have 700 daily active
01:33:13 users a thousand weekly active users open pilot makes tens of thousands of mistakes a week these mistakes have zero
01:33:23 consequences these mistakes are oh it I wanted to take this exit and it went straight so I'm just gonna carefully
01:33:30 touch the wheel humans the humans catch them and the human disengagement is labeling that reinforcement learning in a
01:33:37 completely consequence-free way so driver monitoring is the way you ensure they keep yes they keep paying attention
01:33:44 how is your messaging say I gave you a billion dollars you would be scaling and now oh my fact it's guy couldn't scale with
01:33:50 any amount of money I'd raise money if I could if I had way to scale yeah you're not focusing I don't know I don't know
01:33:55 how to do Oh like I guess I could sell it to more people but I want to make the system better better I don't know I mean
01:34:01 but what's the messaging here I got a chance to talk to you on and and he he basically said that the human factor
01:34:09 doesn't matter you know the human doesn't matter because the system will perform there would be sort of a sorry
01:34:15 to use the term but like a singular like a point where it gets just much better and so the human it won't won't really
01:34:22 matter but it seems like that human caching the system when it gets into trouble is like the thing which will
01:34:31 make something like reinforcement learning work so how do you how do you think messaging for Tesla for you should
01:34:38 chant for the industry in general should change I think my messaging is pretty clear at least like our messaging wasn't
01:34:43 that clear in the beginning and I do kind of fault myself for that we are proud right now to be a level 2 system
01:34:50 we are proud to be level 2 if we talk about level 4 it's not what the current hardware it's not gonna be just a
01:34:56 magical OTA upgrade it's gonna be new hardware it's gonna be very carefully thought-out right now we are proud to be
01:35:02 level 2 and we have a rigorous safety model I mean not like like okay rigorous who knows what that means but we at
01:35:09 least have a safety model and we make it explicit is in safety MD and open pilot and it says seriously though safety dot
01:35:21 MD Android so well this is this is the safety model and I like to have conversations like if like you know
01:35:26 sometimes people will come to you and they're like your systems not safe okay have you read my safety Doc's would you
01:35:32 like to have an intelligent conversation about this and the answer is always no they just like scream about it runs
01:35:39 Python okay what so you're saying that that because pythons not real-time Python not being real-time never causes
01:35:45 disengagement disengagement SAR caused by you know the model is QM but safety dad MD says the following first and
01:35:51 foremost the driver must be paying attention at all times I don't can I do I still consider the
01:35:58 software to be alpha software until we can actually enforce that statement but I feel it's very well
01:36:03 communicated to our users two more things one is the user must be able to easily take control of the vehicle at
01:36:10 all times mm-hmm so if you step on the gas or brake with open pilot
01:36:15 it gives full manual control back to the user or press the cancel button step 2 the car will never react so quickly we
01:36:25 define so quickly to be about one second that you can't react in time and we do this by enforcing torque limits braking
01:36:31 limits and acceleration limits so we have like our torque limits way lower than Tesla's this is another potential
01:36:40 if I could tweak autopilot I would lower their torque limit or would a driver monitoring because
01:36:46 autopilot can jerk the wheel hard yeah open pilot can it's we we limit and all this code is open source readable
01:36:53 and I believe now it's all misery C compliant misra is like the automotive coding standard at first I you know
01:37:03 I've come to respect I've been reading like the standards lately and I've come to respect them they're actually written
01:37:08 by very smart people yeah they're brilliant people actually they have a lot of experience there's sometimes a
01:37:15 little too cautious but in this case it pays off miss was written by like computer scientists and you tell them as
01:37:20 a language they use you can tell by the language they use they talk about like whether certain conditions in misra are
01:37:27 decidable or undecidable you mean like the halting problem and yes well all right you've earned my respect I will
01:37:33 tell you carefully what you have to say and we want to make our code compliant with that all right so you're proud
01:37:38 level two and reform so you were the founder and I think CEO of comm AI then you were the head of research what the
01:37:46 heck are you know what's your connection to come AI the president but I'm one of those like unelect unelected presidents
01:37:53 of like like a small dictatorship country not one of those like elected presidents oh so you're like Putin when
01:38:00 he was like yeah I got sure so there's  what's the governance structure what's the what's the future of commie I
01:38:08 finance I mean as a business do you want you just focused on getting things right now making some small amount of money
01:38:14 and mean to and then one that works it works in each scale our burn rate is about 200k a
01:38:21 month and our revenue is about 100k a month so we need to 4x our revenue but  we haven't like tried very hard at
01:38:28 that yet and the revenue is basically selling stuff online yeah we sell stuff shopped
01:38:33 a comment at AI is there other well okay so you you'll have to figure out that's our that's our only see but to me that's
01:38:40 like respectable revenues yeah we make it by selling products to consumers we're honest and transparent about what
01:38:47 they are most actually level for companies right because you could easily start blowing up like smoke like over
01:38:56 selling the hype and feeding into getting some fundraisers oh you're the guy you're genius because you hacked the
01:39:03 iPhone oh I hate that I hate that yeah I can trade my social capital for more money yeah I did it once I almost regret it
01:39:11 doing the first of it well on a small tangent what's your you seem to not like Fame and yet you're also drawn to fame
01:39:21 what were you on we're on you where are you on that currently have you had some introspection some soul-searching
01:39:29 yeah I actually I've come to a pretty stable position on that like after the first time I realized that I don't want
01:39:36 attention from the masses I want attention from people who I respect who you respect I can give a
01:39:45 list of people so are these like Elon must have characters yeah well actually you know what I'll make it
01:39:51 more broad than that I won't make it about a person I respect skill I respect people who have skills right and I would
01:40:01 like to like be I'm not gonna say famous but be like known among more people who have like real skills who in cars doers
01:40:12 do you think have skill not do you respect Oh Kyle vote has skill a lot of people away mo have skill and I respect
01:40:23 them I I respect them as engineers like I can think I mean I think about all the times in my life where I've been like
01:40:28 dead set on approaches and they turn out to be wrong so I mean this might I might be wrong I
01:40:33 accept that I accept that there's a decent chance that I'm I'm wrong and actually I mean having talked to Chris
01:40:39 Urmson sterling anderson i those those guys I mean I deeply respect Chris I just admire the guy he's legit can you
01:40:49 drive a car through the desert when everybody thinks it's impossible that is that's legit and then I also really
01:40:54 respect the people who are like writing the infrastructure of the world like the linus torvalds and the chris lab they're
01:40:59 doing the real work I know they're doing the real work this every dog that Chris Ladin you realize especially when
01:41:06 they're humble it's like you realize oh you guys were just using your oh yeah all the hard work they did him that's
01:41:16 incredible what do you think mr. Anthony lowendahl ski what do you he's a he's another mad
01:41:24 genius sharp guy oh yeah what do you think he might long-term become a competitor Oh
01:41:31 tu cama well so I think that he has the other right approach I think that right now there's two right approaches one is
01:41:37 what we're doing and one is what he's doing can you describe I think it's called pronto a certain you thing did do
01:41:42 you know what what the approaches actually don't know embark is also doing the same sort of thing the idea is
01:41:49 almost that you want to so if you're I can't partner with Honda and Toyota Honda and Toyota are  like four
01:41:57 hundred thousand person companies it's not even a company at that point like I don't think of it like I don't personify
01:42:03 it I think of it like an object but a trucker drives for a fleet maybe that has like some truckers are independent some
01:42:11 truckers Drive for fleets with a hundred trucks there are tons of independent trucking companies out there start a
01:42:17 trucking company and drive your costs down or figure out how to drive down the cost of trucking another company that I
01:42:26 really respect is  not oh I should I respect their business model no auto sells a driver monitoring camera and
01:42:34 they sell it to fleet owners if I that's right if I owned a fleet of cars and I could pay you know 40 bucks a month to
01:42:42 monitor my employees this is gonna like reduces accidents 18% yeah it's it's so like that in the space
01:42:50 that is like the business model that I like most respect is there creating value today yeah which is  that's a
01:42:58 huge one is how do we create value today with some of this then the link keeping things huge and it sounds like you're
01:43:05 creeping in or full steam ahead on the driver monitoring - yeah which I think actually were the short-term value if
01:43:12 you can get right I still I'm not a huge fan of the statement that everything is to have driver monitoring but will I
01:43:17 agree with that completely but I'm that statement usually misses the point that to get the experience of it right is not
01:43:23 trivial oh no not at all in fact like so right now we have I think the time out depends on speed of the car but we want
01:43:32 to depend on like the scenes day if you're on like an empty Highway it's very different if you don't pay
01:43:38 attention then if light you're like coming up to a traffic light and long-term it should probably learn from
01:43:46 from the driver because that's to do I watched a lot of video we've built a smartphone detector just to analyze how
01:43:52 people are using smartphones and people are using it very differently and there's a it's a texting styles there's
01:44:01 videos yeah like I got billions of miles of people driving cars in this moment I spent a large fraction of my time just
01:44:08 watching videos because it's never fails to to learn like it never I've never failed from a video watching session to
01:44:14 learn something I didn't know before fact I usually like when I eat lunch I'll sit especially when the weather is
01:44:23 good and just watch pedestrians with an eye to understand like from a computer vision I just to see can this model can
01:44:30 you predict what are the decisions made and there's so many things that we don't understand this is what I mean about the
01:44:34 state vector yeah it's I'm trying to always think like Gamma understanding in my human
01:44:43 brain how do we convert that into how hard is the learning problem here I guess is the fundamental question so
01:44:50 something that from a hacking perspective this is always comes up especially with folks well first the
01:44:56 most popular question is the trolley problem right so that's not a sort of a serious problem there are
01:45:03 some ethical questions I think that arise maybe will you want to met you or do you think there's any ethical serious
01:45:11 ethical questions that we have a solution to the trolley problem Akane aye well so there is actually an alert
01:45:17 in our code ethical dilemma detected it's not triggered yeah we don't we don't how you have to detect the ethical
01:45:22 dilemmas but we're a level two system so we're going to disengage and leave that decision to the human you're such a
01:45:27 troll hey no but the trolley problem deserves to be trolled yeah that's a beautiful answer actually I know I gave
01:45:34 it to someone who was like sometimes people ask like you asked about the trolley problems like you can have a
01:45:38 kind of discussion about it like boo you get someone who's like really like earnest about it because it's the kind
01:45:44 of thing where if you ask a bunch of people in an office whether we should use a sequal stack or no sequel stack if
01:45:49 they're not that technical they have no opinion but if you ask them what color they want to paint the office everyone
01:45:54 has an opinion on that and that's why the trolley problem is that's it I mean it's a beautiful answer
01:45:59 yeah we're able to detect the problem and were able to pass it on to the human yeah I've never never heard anyone say
01:46:07 it nice escape route okay but proud level - I'm proud level - I love it so the other thing that people cope you
01:46:14 know have some concern about with AI in general is hacking so how hard is it do you think to hack a nataas vehicle
01:46:23 either through physical access or through the more sort of popular now these adversarial examples on the
01:46:30 sensors be adversarial examples one you want to see some adversarial examples that affect humans right oh well
01:46:38 there used to be a stop sign here but I put a black bag over the stop sign and then people ran it all right adversarial
01:46:44 yeah right like like like there's tons of human adversarial examples - the question in general about like security
01:46:52 if you saw something something just came out today I'm like there are always such high P headlines about like how navigate
01:46:59 on autopilot was fooled by a GPS spoof to take an exit right at least that's all they could do was take an exit if
01:47:06 your car is relying on GPS in order to have a safe driving policy they're doing something if you're relying and this is why v2v is
01:47:14 such a terrible idea v2v now relies on both parties getting communication right this is not even so
01:47:26 I think of safety security is like a special case of safety right safety is like we put a little you know piece of
01:47:33 caution tape around the hole so that people won't walk into it by accident security is I put a 10 foot fence around
01:47:39 the hole so you actually physically cannot climb into it with barbed wire on the top and stuff right so like if
01:47:44 you're designing systems that are like unreliable they're definitely not secure your car should always do something safe
01:47:53 using its local sensors and then the local sensor should be hardwired and then could somebody hack into your can
01:47:58 boss and turn your steering wheel on your brakes yes but they could do it before common
01:48:04 AI too so let's think out of the box and some things so do you think teleoperation has a role in any of this
01:48:12 so remotely stepping in and controlling the cars no I think that if safety if the safety operation by design requires
01:48:26 a constant link to the cars I think it doesn't work so that's the same argument using for v2i VTV well there's a lot of
01:48:34 non safety critical stuff you can do with v2 I like v2 I liked v2 I weigh more than V B because Vita I is is
01:48:39 already like I already have internet in the car right there's a lot of great stuff you can do with v2 I like for
01:48:46 example you can well where I already have v2 Waze is V die right ways can route me around traffic jams that's a
01:48:52 great example of v2 I mm-hmm and then okay the car automatically talks to that same service like improving the
01:48:57 experience but it's not a fundamental fallback for safety know if any of your if any of your if any of your things
01:49:05 that require wireless communication are more than qm like have a nozzle rating you should you previously said that life
01:49:16 is work and then you don't do anything to relax so how do you think about hard work well what is it what do you think
01:49:23 it takes to as great things you know there's a lot of people saying that there needs to be
01:49:29 some balance you know you need to in order to accomplish great things you need to take some time off each of
01:49:35 reflects and so on now and then some people are just insanely working burning the candle at both ends how do you think
01:49:42 about that I think I was trolling in the Siraj interview when I said that off camera right before I spoke a little
01:49:49 bit we'd like get out spot this is a joke right like I do nothing it relaxed look where I am I'm at a party right yeah
01:49:57 that's true so no of course I I don't what I say that life is work though I mean that like I think that what gives
01:50:04 my life meaning is work I don't mean that every minute of the day you should be working I actually think this is not
01:50:09 the best way to maximize results I think that if you're working 12 hours a day you should be working smarter and not harder
01:50:17 well so it gives work gives you meaning for some people other source of meaning is personal relationships yeah like
01:50:23 family and so on you've also in that interview of Sirach or does the the trolling mentioned that
01:50:31 one of the things you look forward to in the future is AI girlfriends yes so at the topic that I'm all very much
01:50:39 fascinated by not necessarily girlfriends but just forming a deep connection with AI what kind of system
01:50:45 do you imagine when you say AI girlfriend whether you were trolling or not know that one I'm very serious about
01:50:51 and I'm serious about that on both a shallow level and a deep level I think that VR brothels are coming soon and are
01:50:58 gonna be really cool it's not cheating if it's a robot I see the slogan already but there's I don't know if you've
01:51:07 watched it just watched the black mirror episode i watch the one year yeah yeah oh the the Ashley - one way da no where
01:51:19 there's two friends were having sex with each other and mo in the VR game your game it's just two guys but yeah one of
01:51:27 them was was a female and yeah there's another mind-blowing concept that in VR you don't have to be the form you can be
01:51:36 to animals having sex weird I mean I'll see you I said the software Maps the nerve endings right
01:51:43 yeah yeah they they sweep a lot of the fascinating really difficult technical challenges under the rock like assuming
01:51:49 it's possible to do the mapping of the nerve endings then I wish yeah I saw that the way they did it with a little
01:51:54 like stim unit on the head that'd be amazing so wanna know on a shallow level like you could set up like almost a
01:52:03 brothel with like real dolls and oculus quests right some good software I think it vehicle novelty experience you know
01:52:13 on a deeper like emotional level I mean yeah I would really like to fall in love with with with the machine do you see
01:52:24 yourself having a long-term relationship of the kind monogamous relationship that we have now with a robot with a a AI
01:52:33 system even not even just the robot so I think about maybe my ideal future when I was fifteen I read eliezer yudkowsky
01:52:43 early writings mmm-hmm on the singularity and like that AI is going to surpass human intelligence
01:52:54 massively he made some Moore's law based predictions that I mostly agree with and then I really struggled for the next
01:53:02 couple years of my life like why should I even bother to learn anything it's all gonna be meaningless when the machines
01:53:09 show up right maybe maybe when I was that young I was still a little bit more pure and really like clung to that and
01:53:14 I'm like wow the machines ain't here yet you know and I seem to be pretty good at this stuff
01:53:18 let's  let's try my best you know like what's the worst that happens but the best possible future I see is me sort of
01:53:27 merging with the Machine and the way that I personify this is in a long-term monogamous relationship with a machine
01:53:33 oh you don't think there's room for another human in your life if you really truly merge with another machine I mean
01:53:42 I see merging I see like the best interface to my brain is like the same relationship and to merge with an AI right
01:53:53 does that merging feel like I see yeah I've seen couples who've been together for a long time and like I almost think
01:53:59 of them as one person like couples who spend all their time together and that's that's how you're actually putting what
01:54:05 does that merging actually looks like it's not just a nice channel like a lot of people imagine it's just an efficient
01:54:13 link search link to Wikipedia or something I don't believe in that but it's more you're saying that there's the
01:54:18 same kind of the same kind of relationship you have one other human that's a deep relationship is that's
01:54:23 what merging looks like that's that's pretty  I don't believe that link is possible I think that that link so
01:54:29 you're like oh me to download Wikipedia right to my brain yeah my reading speed is not limited by my eyes my reading
01:54:35 speed is limited by my inner processing locally and to like bootstrap that sounds kind of unclear how to do it and
01:54:44 horrify but if I am with somebody and I'll use a somebody who is making a super sophisticated model of me and then
01:54:53 running simulations on that model I'm not gonna get into the question whether the simulations are conscious or not I
01:54:56 don't really want to know what it's doing but using those simulations to play out hypothetical futures for me deciding
01:55:05 what things to say to me to guide me along a path and that's how I envision it so on that path to AI of superhuman
01:55:15 level intelligence you've mentioned that you believe in the singularity that singularity is coming yeah again could
01:55:20 be trolling could be not could be part I'm all trolling his truth in it I don't know what that means anymore what is the
01:55:26 singularity yeah so that's that's really the question how many years do you think before the singularity what form do you
01:55:32 think it will take does that mean fundamental shifts and capabilities of AI does it mean some other kind of ideas
01:55:41 maybe this is just my roots but so I can buy a human beings worth of compute for like a million bucks that I it's
01:55:48 about one TPU pod v3 I want like I think they claim a hundred peda flops that's being generous I think humans are
01:55:52 actually more like twenty so that's like five humans that's pretty good Google needs to sell their teepees um
01:55:57 but I could buy I could buy I could buy GPUs I could buy a stack of like by 1080 tea eyes build data center full of them
01:56:06 four million box I can get a human worth of compute but when you look at the total number of flops in the world when
01:56:14 you look at human flops which goes up very very slowly with the population and machine flops which goes up
01:56:21 exponentially but it's still nowhere near I think that's the key thing to talk about when the singularity happened
01:56:28 when most flops in the world are silicon and not biological that's kind of the crossing point like they are now the
01:56:36 dominant species on the planet and just looking at how technology is progressing when do you think that could possibly happen
01:56:41 you think go to happen in your lifetime oh yeah definitely my lifetime I've done the math I like 2038 because it's the
01:56:51 UNIX timestamp rollover yeah beautifully put so you've you said that the meaning of life has to win if you look five years
01:57:00 into the future what does winning look like so hi there's a lot of I can go into like
01:57:13 technical depth to what I mean by that to win it may not mean I was criticized for that in the comments like
01:57:19 doesn't this guy want to like save the penguins in Antarctica or like you know listen to what I'm saying I'm not
01:57:26 talking about like I have a yacht or something I am an agent I am put into this world and I don't really know what
01:57:38 my purpose is but if you're a reinforcement if you're if you're an intelligent agent and you're put into a
01:57:43 world what is the ideal thing to do well the ideal thing mathematically you go back to like Schmitt Hoover theories
01:57:49 about this is to build a compressive model of the world to build a maximally compressive to explore the world such
01:57:56 that your exploration function maximizes the derivative of compression of the past mid Hoover has a paper about this
01:58:02 and like I took that kind of as like a personal goal function so what I mean to win I mean like maybe maybe this is
01:58:10 religious but like I think that in the future I might be given a real purpose or I may decide this purpose myself and
01:58:16 then at that point now I know what the game is and I know how to win I think right now I'm still just trying to
01:58:21 figure out what the game is but once I know so you have you have imperfect information you have a lot of
01:58:28 uncertainty about the reward function and you're discovering it exactly the purpose is that's that's the better way
01:58:34 to put it the purpose is to maximize it while you have it a lot of uncertainty around it and you're both reducing the
01:58:40 uncertainty and maximizing at the same time yeah and so that's at the technical level what is the if you believe in the
01:58:47 universal prior yeah what is the universal reward function that's the better way to put it so that
01:58:54 when it's interesting I think I speak for everyone in saying that I wonder what that reward function is for you and
01:59:05 I look forward to seeing that in five years in ten years I think a lot of people who do myself right and cheering
