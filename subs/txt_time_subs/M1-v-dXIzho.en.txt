00:00:01 the following is a conversation with Suresh Carmen a professor at MIT co-founder of the autonomous vehicle
00:00:08 company optimist ride and is one of the top roboticists in the world including robots that drive and robots that fly to
00:00:17 me personally he has been a mentor a colleague and a friend he's one of the smartest most generous people I know so
00:00:24 it was a pleasure and honor to finally sit down with him for this recorded conversation this is the artificial
00:00:30 intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe I knew to review five stars in Apple podcast supported on patreon or
00:00:37 simply connect with me on Twitter and Lex Friedman spelled Fri D ma n as usual I'll do a few minutes of ads now and
00:00:45 never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation I hope that works for you it doesn't hurt
00:00:52 the listening experience this show is presented by cash app the number one finance app in the App Store when you
00:00:59 get it use the code lex podcast cash app lets you send money to friends buy Bitcoin and invest in the stock market
00:01:06 with as little as $1 this cash app allows you to send and receive money digitally let me mention a surprising
00:01:13 fact about physical money it costs 2.4 cents to produce a single penny in fact I think it costs 85 million dollars
00:01:22 annually to produce them that's a crazy little fact about physical money so again if you get cash out from the App
00:01:29 Store Google Play and use the collects podcast you get $10 and cash Apple also donate $10 the first an organization
00:01:36 that is helping to advanced robotics and STEM education for young people around the world and now here's my conversation
00:01:44 with Sir - Carmen since you have worked extensively on both what is the more difficult task
00:01:50 autonomous flying or autonomous driving that's a good question I think that autonomous flying just kind
00:01:58 of doing it for consumer drones and so on the kinds of applications that we're looking at right now is probably easier
00:02:03 and so I think that that's maybe one of the reasons why it took off like literally a little earlier than the
00:02:09 autonomous cars but I think if we look ahead I would think that you know the real benefits of autonomous flying
00:02:15 unleashing them in like transportation logistics and so on I think it's a lot harder than autonomous driving so I
00:02:21 think my guess is that you know we've seen a few kind of machines fly here and there but we really haven't yet seen any
00:02:29 kind of you know machine like like at massive scale large-scale being deployed and flown and so on and I think that's
00:02:36 gonna be after we kind of resolve some of the large scale deployments of autonomous driving it was the hard part
00:02:42 what's your intuition behind why at scale when consumer-facing drones are tough so I think in general its scale is
00:02:52 tough like for example I mean you think about it we have actually deployed a lot of robots in the let's say the past 50
00:03:02 years we academics or we business I think we as humanity deployed a lot of robots and I think that when you think
00:03:13 about it you know robots they're autonomous they work and they work on their own but they are either like in
00:03:20 isolated environments or they are in sort of you know they may be at scale but they're really confined to a certain
00:03:29 environment that they don't interact so much with humans and so you know they work in
00:03:33 I don't know factory floors their houses they work on Mars you know they are fully autonomous over there but I think
00:03:41 that the real challenge of our time is to take these vehicles and put them into places where humans are present so now I
00:03:49 know that there's a lot of like human robot interaction type of things that need to be done and so on that's that's
00:03:54 one thing but even just from the fundamental algorithms and systems and and the business cases or maybe the
00:04:02 business models even like architecture planning societal issues legally there's a whole bunch of pack of things that are
00:04:09 related to us putting robotic vehicles into human present environments and these humans you know they will not
00:04:17 potentially be even trained to interact with them they may not even be using the services that are provided by these
00:04:22 vehicles they may not even know that they're autonomous they're just doing their thing living in environments that
00:04:28 are designed for humans not for robots and that I think is one of the biggest challenges I think over our time to put
00:04:36 vehicles there and you know to go back to your question I think doing that at scale meaning you know you go out in a
00:04:44 city and you have you know like thousands or tens of thousands of autonomous vehicles that are going
00:04:50 around it is so dance to the point where if you see one of them you look around you see another one it is that dance and
00:04:57 that density we've never done anything like that before and I would I would bet that that kind of density will first
00:05:05 happen with autonomous cars because I think you know we can ban the environment a little bit we can
00:05:12 especially kind of making them safe is a lot easier when they're like on the ground when they're in the air it's a
00:05:19 little bit more complicated but I don't see that there's gonna be a big separation I think that you know there
00:05:23 will come a time that we're gonna quickly see these things unfold do you think there will be a time where there's
00:05:29 tens of thousands of delivery drones they fill this guy you know I think I think it's possible to be honest
00:05:35 delivery drones is one thing but you know you can imagine for transportation like a like an important use cases but
00:05:41 you know we're in Boston you want to go from Boston to New York and you want to do it from the top of this building to
00:05:47 the top of another building in Manhattan and you're gonna do it in one and a half hours and that's that's a big
00:05:54 opportunity I think personal transport so like you and your friend like oh yeah or almost like I like like an uber so
00:06:01 like four people six people a people in our work in autonomous vehicles I see that so there's kind of like a bit of a
00:06:07 need for you know one person transport but also like like a few people so you and I could take the trip together we
00:06:12 could have lunch that you know I think kind of sounds crazy maybe even sounds a bit cheesy but
00:06:18 I think that those kinds of things are some of the real opportunities and I think you know it's not like the typical
00:06:25 airplane and the airport would disappear very quickly but I would think that you know many people would feel like they
00:06:32 would spend an extra hundred dollars on doing that and cutting that for our travel down to one and a half hours so
00:06:40 how feasible are flying cars it's been the dream that's like when people imagine the future for 50 plus years
00:06:47 they think fine cars it's a it's like all technology is just cheesy to think about now because it seems so far away
00:06:55 but overnight it can change but just technically speaking in your view how feasible is it to make that happen I'll
00:07:01 get to that question but just one thing is that I think you know sometimes we think about what's gonna happen in the
00:07:08 next 50 years it's just really hard to guess right next 50 years I don't know I mean we could yet what's gonna happen in
00:07:13 transportation in the next 50 we could get flying saucers I I could bet on that I think there's a 50/50 chance that you
00:07:18 know like you can build machines that can ionize the air around them and push it down with magnets and they would fly
00:07:25 like a flying saucer that is possible and it might happen in the next 50 years so it's a bit hard to guess like when
00:07:32 you think about 50 years before but I would think that you know there's this this kind of notion where there's a
00:07:39 certain type of air space that we call the agile airspace and there is there's good amount of opportunities in that airspace
00:07:46 so that would be the space that is kind of a little bit higher than the place where you can throw a stone because
00:07:52 that's a tough thing when you think about it you know it takes a kid on a stone to take an aircraft down and then
00:08:00 what happens but you know imagine the airspace that's high enough so that you cannot throw a stone but it is low
00:08:07 enough that you're not interacting with the with the very large aircraft that are you know flying several thousand
00:08:16 feet above and that airspace is underutilized or it's actually kind of not utilized at all yeah that's right so
00:08:21 there's you know there's like recreational people kind of fly every now and then but it's very few
00:08:27 if you look up in the sky you may not see any of them at any given time every night now you'll see one airplane
00:08:33 utilizing that space and you'll be surprised and the moment you're outside of an airport a little bit like it's
00:08:39 just kind of flies off and it goes out and I think utilizing that airspace the technical challenge is there is you know
00:08:49 building an autonomy and ensuring that that kind of autonomy is safe ultimately I think it is going to be building in
00:08:58 complex software are complicated so that it's maybe a few orders of magnitude more complicated than what we have on
00:09:06 aircraft today and at the same time ensuring just like we ensure on aircraft ensuring that it's safe and so that
00:09:13 becomes like building that kind of complicated hardware and a software becomes a challenge especially when you
00:09:19 know you build that hardware I mean you build that software with data and so you know it's it's of course
00:09:28 there's some rule by software in there that kind of do a certain set of things but but then you know there's a lot of
00:09:33 training merit machine learning will be key to these guys to delivering safe vehicles in the future especially not
00:09:42 maybe the safe part but I think the intelligent part I mean there are certain things that we do it with
00:09:48 machine learning and it's just there's like right now all the way and and I don't I don't know how else they could
00:09:55 be done and you know there's there's always this conundrum I mean we could I could be like we could maybe gather
00:10:05 billions of programmers humans who program perception algorithms that detect things in the sky and whatever or
00:10:13 you know we I don't know we maybe even have robots like learning a simulation environment and transfer and they might
00:10:19 be learning a lot better in a simulation environment than a billion humans put their brains together and try to program
00:10:28 humans pretty limited what's  what's the role of simulations withdrawals if you've done quite a bit of work there
00:10:33 how promising just the very thing you said just now how promising is the possibility of training
00:10:42 and developing a safe flying robot in simulation and deploying it and having that work pretty well in the real world
00:10:49 I think that you know a lot of people when they hear simulation they will focus on training immediately but I
00:10:55 think one thing that you said which was interesting it's developing I think simulation environments are
00:11:00 actually could be key and great for development and that's not new like for example you know there's people in the
00:11:08 automotive industry have been using dynamic simulation for like decades now and and it's pretty standard that you
00:11:15 know you would build and you would simulate if you want to build an embedded controller you plug that kind
00:11:21 of embedded computer into another computer that other computer would simulate tiny and so on and I think you
00:11:26 know fast forward these things you can create pretty crazy simulation environments like for instance one of the things that
00:11:34 has happened recently and that you know we can do now is that we can simulate cameras a lot better than we used to
00:11:40 simulate them we were able to simulate them before and that's I think we just hit the elbow on that kind of
00:11:47 improvement I would imagine that really improvements in hardware especially and with improvements and machine learning I
00:11:54 think that we would get to a point where we can simulate cameras very very much similar cameras means simulate how a
00:12:02 real camera would see the real world therefore you can explore the limitations of that you can train
00:12:10 perception algorithms on the in simulation all that kind of stuff exactly so you know it's it has been
00:12:18 easier to simulate what we will called interoceptive sensors like internal sensors so for example inertial sensing
00:12:24 has been easy to simulate it has also been easily simulate dynamics like like physics that are governed by ordinary
00:12:31 differential equations I mean like how a car goes around maybe have it rolls on the road how they interact with it
00:12:37 interacts with the road or even an aircraft flying around like the dynamic the physics of that what has been really
00:12:44 hard has been to simulate extra Sept of sensors sensors that kind of like look out from the vehicle and that's a new
00:12:51 thing that's coming like laser rangefinders they're a little bit easier cameras radars are a little bit
00:12:57 tougher I think once we nail that down the the next challenge I think in simulation will be to simulate human
00:13:05 behavior that's also extremely hard even when you imagine like how a human driven car would act around even that is hard
00:13:14 but imagine trying to simulate you know a a model of a human just doing a bunch of gestures and so on and and you know
00:13:20 it's it's actually simulated it's not captured like with a motion capture but it is similarly that's that's very in
00:13:27 fact today I get involved a lot with like sort of this kind of very high-end rendering projects and I have like this
00:13:33 test that I've pass it to my friends or my mom you know ice and like two photos two kind of pictures and I say rendered
00:13:39 which one is rendered which one is real and it's pretty hard to distinguish except I realized except when we put
00:13:45 humans in there it's possible that our brains are trained in a way that we recognize humans extremely well but we
00:13:52 don't so much recognize the built environments because built an alarm sort of came after per se we evolved into
00:13:58 sort of being humans but but humans were always there same thing happens for example you look at like monkeys and you
00:14:05 can't distinguish one from another but they sort of do and it's very possible that they look at humans it's kind of
00:14:10 pretty hard to distinguish one from another but we do and so our eyes are pretty well trained to look at humans
00:14:17 and understand if something is off we will get it we may not be able to pinpoint it so in my typical friend test
00:14:23 or mom test what would happen is that we put like a human walking in you know anything and they they say you know this
00:14:30 is not right something is off in this video I don't know what but I can tell you it's too human I can take the human
00:14:36 and I can show you like inside of a building or like an apartment and it will look like if we had time to render
00:14:43 it it will look great and this should be no surprise a lot of movies that people are watching it's all computer-generated
00:14:49 you know even nowadays when you watch a drama movie and like there's nothing going on action wise but it turns out
00:14:54 it's kinda like cheaper I guess to render the background and so they would but how do we get there how do we get a human
00:15:07 would pass the mom / friend test a simulation of a human walking do you think that's something we can creep up
00:15:16 do by just doing kind of a comparison learning or you have humans annotate what's more realistic and not just by
00:15:24 watching they go what what's the path is it seems totally mysterious how we thing right simulate human behavior
00:15:31 it's it's hard because a lot of the other things that I mentioned to you including simulating cameras right it is
00:15:39 the the thing there is that you know we know the physics we know how it works like in the real world and we can write
00:15:46 some rules and we can do that like for example simulating cameras there's this thing called ray tracing I mean you
00:15:53 literally just kind of imagine it's very similar to it's not exactly the same but it's very similar to tracing photon by
00:15:59 photon they're going around bouncing on things and coming your eye a human behavior developing a dynamic like like
00:16:07 like a model of that that is mathematical so that you can put it into a processor that would go through that
00:16:14 that's gonna be hard and so so what else do you got you can collect data right and you can try to match the data or
00:16:21 another thing that you can do is that you know you can show the Frant test you know you can say this or that and this
00:16:26 or that and that will be labeling anything that requires human labeling ultimately we're limited by the number
00:16:31 of humans that you know we have available at a heart disposal and the things that they can do you know they
00:16:36 have to do a lot of other things than also labeling this data so so that modeling human behavior part is is I
00:16:44 think going we're gonna realize it's very tough and I think that also effects you know our development of autonomous
00:16:52 vehicles I see them self-driving in smile like you want to use so you're building self-driving you know it the
00:16:58 first time like right after urban challenge I think everybody focused on localization mapping and localization
00:17:04 you know as slam algorithms came in Google was just doing that and so building these HD maps basically that's
00:17:11 about knowing where you are and then five years later in 2012-2013 came the kind of coding code AI revolution and
00:17:17 that started telling us about everybody else's but we're still missing what everybody else is gonna do next and so
00:17:24 you want to know where you are you want to know what everybody else is hopefully you know about what you're gonna do next
00:17:29 and then you want to predict what other people are going to do and that last bit has been a real real challenge what do
00:17:38 you think is the role your own of you of your the ego vehicle the robot you the the you the robotic you in controlling
00:17:48 and having some control of how the future on roles of what's going to happen in the future that seems to be a
00:17:54 little bit ignored in trying to predict the future is how you yourself can affect that future by being either
00:18:03 aggressive or less aggressive or signaling in some kind of way so this kind of game theoretic dance seems to be
00:18:11 ignored for the moment it's yeah it's it's totally ignored I mean it's it's quite interesting actually like how we
00:18:19 how we interact with things versus we interact with humans like so if if you see a vehicle that's completely empty
00:18:27 and it's trying to do something all of a sudden it becomes a thing so interacted with like you interact
00:18:33 with this table and so you can throw your backpack or you can kick your kick it put your feet on it and things like
00:18:40 that but when it's a human there's all kinds of ways of interacting with a human so if you know like you and I are
00:18:45 face to face we're very civil you know we talk understand each other for the most part you'll see you just but but
00:18:54 the thing is that like for example you and I might interact through YouTube comments and you know the conversation
00:19:01 may go a totally different angle and so I think people kind of abusing these autonomous vehicles is a real issue in
00:19:09 some sense and so when you're an ego vehicle you're trying to you know coordinate your way make your way it's
00:19:14 actually kind of harder than being a human you know it's like it's you you you not only need to be as smart as kind
00:19:21 of humans are but you also you're a thing so they're gonna abuse you a little bit so you need to make sure that
00:19:29 you can get around and do something so yeah III in general believe in that sort of game theoretic aspects I've actually
00:19:37 personally have done you know quite a few papers both on that kind of game theory and also like this this kind of
00:19:43 understanding people's social value orientation for example you know some people are aggressive some people not so
00:19:50 much and and you know like you robot could understand that by just looking at how people drive and as they kind of
00:19:56 come and approach you can actually understand like if someone is gonna be aggressive or or not as a robot and you
00:20:03 can make certain decisions well in terms of predicting what they're going to do the hard question is you as a robot
00:20:11 should you be aggressive or not when faced with it was an aggressive role but right now it seems like aggressive is a
00:20:18 very dangerous thing to do because it's costly from a societal perspective how you're perceived people are not very
00:20:25 accepting of aggressive robots emotive Society I think that's accurate so that is really is and so I'm not entirely
00:20:34 sure like how to have to go about but it I know I know for a fact that how these robots interact with other people in
00:20:40 there is going to be and then interaction is always gonna be there I mean you could be interacting with other
00:20:45 vehicles or other just people kind of like walking around and like I said the moment there's like nobody in the seat
00:20:53 it's like an empty thing just rolling off the street it becomes like no different than like any other thing
00:21:01 that's not human and so so people and maybe abuse is the wrong word but you know people may be rightfully even they
00:21:07 feel like you know this is a human present environments designed for humans to be and and they they kind of they
00:21:13 want to own it and then you know the robots they would they would need to understand and they would need to
00:21:18 respond in a certain way and I think that you know this actually opens up like quite a few interesting societal
00:21:24 questions for us as we deploy like we talk robots at large scale so what would happen when we try to deploy robots at
00:21:30 large scale I think is that we can design systems in a way that they're very efficient or we can design them
00:21:37 that they're very sustainable but ultimately the sustainability efficiency trade-offs like they're gonna be right
00:21:42 in there we're gonna have to make some choices like we're not going to be able to just
00:21:48 kind of put it aside so for example we can be very aggressive and we can reduce transportation delays increase capacity
00:21:55 of transportation or you know we can we can be a lot nicer and other people to kind of coding code on the environment
00:22:02 and live in a nice place and then efficiency will drop so when you think about it I think sustainability gets
00:22:09 attached to energy consumption or I wanna have the impact immediately and those are those are there but like
00:22:15 livability is another sustainability impact so you create an environment that people want to live in and if robots are
00:22:22 going around being aggressive and you don't want to live in that environment maybe however you should note that if
00:22:27 you're not being aggressive then you know you're probably taking up some some delays in transportation and listen that
00:22:34 so you're always balancing that and I think this this choice has always been there in transportation but I think the
00:22:40 more autonomy comes in the more explicit the choice becomes yeah when it becomes explicit that we can start to optimize
00:22:48 it and I will get to ask the very difficult societal questions of what do we value more efficiency or
00:22:54 sustainability it's kind of interesting there will happen like I think we're gonna have to like I think that the the
00:23:00 interesting thing about like the whole autonomous vehicles question I think is also kind of I think a lot of times you
00:23:07 know we have we have focused on technology development like hundreds of years and you know the products somehow
00:23:14 followed and and then you know we got to make these choices and things like that but this is this is a good time that you
00:23:20 know we even think about you know autonomous taxi type of deployments and the systems that would evolve from there
00:23:27 and you realize the business models are different the impact on architecture is different urban planning you get into
00:23:36 like regulations and then you get into like these issues that you didn't think about before but like sustainability and
00:23:41 ethics is like right in the middle of it I mean even testing autonomous vehicles like think about it you're testing
00:23:46 autonomous vehicles in human present environments I mean the risk may be very small but still you know it's it's a
00:23:53 it's a it's it's a you know strictly greater than zero risk that you're putting peep
00:23:59 and so then you have that innovation you know risk trade-off that you're in that somewhere and we understand that pretty
00:24:07 now they pretty well now is that if we don't test the beast day the development will be slower I mean it it doesn't mean
00:24:14 that we're not gonna be able to develop I think it's gonna be pretty hard actually maybe we can we don't real I don't know
00:24:20 but well the thing is that those kinds of trade-offs we already are making and as these systems become more ubiquitous
00:24:27 I think those trade-offs will just really hit so you are one of the founders of optimist ride and town
00:24:35 vehicle company and we'll talk about it well let me and that point ask maybe good examples
00:24:44 keeping optimist right out of this question sort of exemplars of different strategies on the spectrum of innovation
00:24:57 and safety or caution so you dick way Moe Google self-driving car way Moe represents maybe a more cautious
00:25:05 approach and then you have Tesla on the other side added by Elon Musk that represents some more however which
00:25:12 adjectives you want to use aggressive innovative I don't know but what what do you think about the difference between
00:25:21 its two strategies in your view what's more likely what's needed and is more likely to succeed in the short term in
00:25:30 the long term definitely some sort of balance is is kind of the right way to go but I do think that the thing that is
00:25:37 the most important is actually like an informed public so I don't I don't mind you know I personally like if I were in
00:25:47 some place I wouldn't mind so much like taking a certain amount of risk some other people might and so I think the
00:25:56 key is for people to be informed and so that they can ideally they can make a choice in some cases that kind of choice
00:26:04 making that anonymously is of course very hard but I don't think it's actually that hard to inform people
00:26:13 so I think in in in one case like for example even the Tesla approach I don't know it's hard to judge how he informed
00:26:20 it is but it is somewhat informed I mean you know things kind of come out I think people know what they're taking and
00:26:26 things like that and so on but I think the underlying I do think that these two companies are a little bit kind of
00:26:34 representing like babe of course that you know one of them seems a bit safer the other one or you know whatever the
00:26:40 objective for that is and the other one seems more aggressive or whatever the ejector for that is but but I think you
00:26:46 know when you turn the tables they're actually they're two other orthogonal dimensions that these two are focusing
00:26:51 on on the one hand for remo I can see that you know they're I mean they I think they're a little bit see it as
00:26:58 research as well so they kind of they don't I'm not sure if they're like really interested in like an immediate
00:27:05 product you know they talk about it sometimes there's some pressure to talk about it so they kind of go for it but I
00:27:12 think I think that they're thinking maybe in the back of their minds maybe they don't put it this way but I think
00:27:18 they they realize that we're building like a new engine it's kind of like call it the AI engine or whatever that is and
00:27:25 you know an autonomous vehicles is a very interesting embodiment of that engine that allows you to understand
00:27:31 where the ego vehicle is the ego thing is where everything else is what everything else is gonna do and how do
00:27:36 you react how do you actually you know interact with humans the right way how do you build these systems and I think
00:27:42 they want to know that they want to understand that and so they keep going and doing that and so on the other
00:27:47 dimension Tesla is doing something interesting I mean I think that they have a good product people use it think
00:27:53 that you know like it's not for me but I can totally see people people like it and and people I think they have a
00:27:59 good product outside of automation but I was just referring to the the automation itself I mean you know like it kind of
00:28:06 drives itself you still have to be kind of you still have to pay attention to it right you know people seem to use it so
00:28:15 it works for something and so people I think people are willing to pay for it people are willing to buy it I think it
00:28:20 it's it's one of the other reasons why people buy a Tesla car maybe one of those reasons is Elon Musk
00:28:26 is the CEO and you know he seems like a visionary person that's what people think you know it seems like a visionary
00:28:30 person and so it adds like 5k to the value of the car and then maybe another 5k is the autopilot and and you know
00:28:35 it's it's useful I mean it's useful in the sense that like people are using it and so III can
00:28:44 see Tesla and sure of course they want to be visionary they want to kind of put out a certain approach and they may
00:28:50 actually get there but I think that there's also a primary benefit of doing all these updates and rolling it out
00:28:57 because you know people pay for it and it's it's your home it's basic you know demand supply market and people like it
00:29:05 they're happy to pay another 5k 10k for that novelty or whatever that is they and they use it it's not like they get
00:29:12 it and they try it a couple times it's a novelty but they use it a lot of the time and so I think that's what Tesla is
00:29:18 doing it's actually pretty different like they are on pretty orthogonal dimensions of what kind of things that
00:29:23 they're building they are using the same AI engine so it's very possible that you know they're both gonna be sort of one
00:29:33 day kind of using a similar almost like an internal internal combustion engine it's a very bad metaphor but similar
00:29:39 internal combustion engine and maybe one of them is building like a car the other one is building a truck or something so
00:29:44 ultimately the use case is very different so you like I said or one of the founders of Optimus rad let's take a
00:29:51 step back it's one of the success stories in the autonomous vehicle space it's a great attack vehicle company
00:29:58 let's go from the very beginning what does it take to start autonomous vehicle company how do you go from idea to
00:30:05 deploying vehicles like you are and a few a bunch of places including New York I would say that I think that you know
00:30:11 what happened to us is it was was the following I think we've realized a lot of kind of talk in the autonomous
00:30:19 vehicle industry back in like 2014 even when we wanted to kind of get started and I don't know like I kind of I would
00:30:29 hear things like fully autonomous vehicles two years from now three years from now I kind of never bought it you
00:30:36 know I was a part of MIT zorbing Channel Gentry it kind of like it has an interesting history so I did in college
00:30:44 and in high school sort of a lot of mathematically oriented work and I think I kind of you know at some point it kind
00:30:51 of hit me I wanted to build something and so I came to MIT mechanical engineering program and I now realize I
00:30:58 think my advisor hired me because I could do like really good math but I told him that no no no I want to work on
00:31:04 that urban challenge car I want to build the autonomous car and I think that was that was kind of like a process why we
00:31:10 really learned I mean what the challenges are and and what kind of limitations are we up against you know
00:31:17 like having the limitations of computers or understanding human behavior there's so many of these things and I think it's
00:31:25 just kind of didn't and so so we said hey you know like why don't we take a more like a market-based approach so we
00:31:32 focus on a certain kind of market and we build a system for that what we're building is not so much of like an
00:31:38 autonomous vehicle only I would say so we build full autonomy into the vehicles but you know the way we kind of see it
00:31:46 is that we think that the approach should actually involve humans operating that not just just not sitting in the
00:31:54 vehicle and I think today what we have is today we have one person operate one vehicle no matter what that vehicle it
00:32:02 could be a forklift it could be a truck it could be a car whatever that is and we want to go from that to ten people
00:32:10 operate 50 vehicles how do we do that you're referring to a world of maybe perhaps teleoperation so can you just
00:32:18 say what it means for 10 might be confusing for people listening what does it mean for ten people to control 50
00:32:24 vehicles that's a good point so I think it's am I very deliberately didn't call it a law operation because people what
00:32:31 people think then is that people think away from the vehicle sits a person sees like maybe put some goggles or something
00:32:39 ER and drives the car so that's not at all what we need but we mean the kind of intelligence bye-bye
00:32:46 humans are in control except in certain places the vehicles can execute on their own and so imagine
00:32:53 like like a room where people can see what the other vehicles are doing and everything and you know there will be
00:32:59 some people who are more like more like air traffic controllers call them like AV controllers yeah
00:33:05 and so these AV controllers would actually see kind of like like a whole map and they would understand where
00:33:12 vehicles are really confident and where they kind of you know need a little bit more help and the help shouldn't be for
00:33:20 safety how it should be for efficiency vehicles should be safe no matter what if you had zero people they could be
00:33:26 very safe but they be going five miles an hour and so if you want them to go around 25 miles an hour then you need
00:33:33 people to come in and and for example you know the vehicle come to an intersection and the vehicle can say you
00:33:39 know I can wait I can inch forward a little bit show my intent or I can turn left and right now
00:33:47 it's clear I can turn I know that but before you give me the go I won't and so that's one example this doesn't mean
00:33:53 necessarily we're doing that actually I think I think if you go down all them all that much detail that every
00:34:01 intersection you're kind of expecting a person to press a button then I don't think you'll get the efficiency benefits
00:34:06 you want you need to be able to kind of go around and be able to do these things but but I think you need people to be
00:34:11 able to set high level behavior to vehicles that's the other thing with autonomous vehicles you know I think a
00:34:15 lot of people kind of think about it as follows I mean this happens with technology a lot you know you think
00:34:22 alright so I know about cars and I heard robots so I think how this is gonna work out is that I'm gonna buy a car press a
00:34:29 button and it's gonna drive itself and when is that gonna happen you know and people kind of tend to think about it
00:34:34 that way but when you think about what really happens is that something comes in in a way that you didn't even expect
00:34:42 if asked you might have said I don't think I need that or I don't think it should be that and so on and then and
00:34:47 then that that becomes the next big thing coding code and so I think that this kind of different ways of humans
00:34:54 operating vehicles could be really powerful I think that sooner than then later we might open our eyes up to a
00:35:02 world in which you go around walk in a mall and there's a bunch of security they're exactly operated in this way you
00:35:08 go into a factory or a warehouse there's a whole bunch of robots they're pretty exactly in this way you go to a you go
00:35:15 to the Brooklyn Navy Yard you see a whole bunch of autonomous vehicles Optimus right and they're operated maybe
00:35:21 in this way yes but I think people kind of don't see that III sincerely think that it's it's there's a possibility
00:35:27 that we may almost see like like a whole mushrooming of this technology in all kinds of places that we didn't expect
00:35:34 before and then maybe the real surprise and then one day when your car actually drives itself it may not be all that
00:35:40 much of a surprise at all because you see it all the time you interact with them you take the Optimus
00:35:47 ride hopefully that's your choice and then you know you you hear a bunch of things you go around you in your act
00:35:53 with them I don't know like you have a little delivery vehicle that goes around the sidewalks and delivers you things
00:35:58 and then you take it it says thank you and then you get used to that and one day your car actually drives itself and
00:36:05 the regulation goes by and you know you can hit the button asleep and it wouldn't be a surprise at all I think
00:36:11 that maybe the real reality so there's gonna be a bunch of applications that pop up around autonomous vehicles some
00:36:19 some of which maybe many of which we don't expect at all so if we look at Optimus ride what do you think you know
00:36:27 the viral application that the one that like really works for people in mobility what do you think optimus ride will
00:36:35 connect with in in in near future first I think that the first place is that that I like the target honestly is like
00:36:43 these places where transportation is required within an environment like people typically call a geofence so you
00:36:49 can imagine like a roughly two mile by two mile could be bigger could be smaller type of an environment and
00:36:54 there's a lot of these kinds of environments they're typically transportation deprived the Brooklyn
00:36:59 Navy Yard that you know we're in today we're in a few different places but that's that was the one that was less
00:37:06 publicized that's a good example so there's not a lot of transportation there and you wouldn't expect like I
00:37:12 don't know I think maybe operating an uber there ends up being sort of a little too expensive or when you compare
00:37:19 it with operating uber that becomes the elsewhere becomes the priority and these people whose place
00:37:24 has become totally transportation deprived and then what happens is that you know people drive into these places
00:37:31 and to go from point A to point B inside this place within that day they use their cars and so we end up building
00:37:38 more parking for them to for example take their cars and go to the lunch place and I think that one of the things
00:37:46 that can be done is that you know you can put in efficient safe sustainable transportation systems into these types
00:37:54 of places first and I think that you know you could deliver mobility in an affordable way affordable accessible you
00:38:04 know sustainable way but I think what also enables is that this kind of effort money area land that we spend on parking
00:38:13 we could reclaim some of that and that is on the order of like even for a small environment like two mile by two mile it
00:38:18 doesn't have to be smack in the middle of New York I mean anywhere else you're talking tens of millions of dollars if
00:38:24 you're smack in the middle of New York you're looking at billions of dollars of savings just by doing that and that's
00:38:30 the economic part of it and there's a societal part right I mean just look around I mean the places that we live
00:38:38 are like built for cars it didn't look like this just like a hundred years ago like today no one walks in the middle of
00:38:46 the street it's four cars we no one tells you that growing up but you grow into that reality and so sometimes they
00:38:51 close the road it happens here you know like the celebration they close the road still
00:38:56 people don't walk in the middle of the road like just walk in and people don't but I think it has so much impact the
00:39:04 the car in in the space that we have and and I think we talked about sustainability livability I mean
00:39:09 ultimately these kinds of places that parking spots at the very least could change into something more useful or
00:39:15 maybe just like park areas recreational and so I think that's the first thing that that we're targeting and I think
00:39:21 that we're getting like a really good response both from an economic societal point of view especially places that are
00:39:27 a little bit forward-looking and like for example Brooklyn Navy Yard they have tenants there
00:39:34 distinct I recall like new lab it's kind of like an Innovation Center there's a bunch of startups there and so you know
00:39:38 you get those kinds of people and you know that they're really interested in sort of making that environment more
00:39:45 livable and these kinds of solutions that Optimus tried provides almost kind of comes in and and becomes that and
00:39:51 many of these places that are transportation deprived you know they have they actually ran shuttles and so
00:40:01 you know you can ask anybody the shuttle experience is like terrible people hate shuttles and I can tell you why it's
00:40:09 because you know like the driver is very expensive in a shuttle business so what makes sense is to attach 2030 seats to a
00:40:16 driver and a lot of people have this misconception they think that shuttle should be big sometimes we get that our
00:40:20 optimist right we tell them we're gonna give you like four seater six Cedars and we get asked like how about like twenty
00:40:26 Cedars like you know you don't need twenty Cedars you want to split up those seeds so that they can travel faster and
00:40:32 the transportation delays would go down that's what you want if you make it big not only you will get delays in
00:40:39 transportation but you won't have an agile vehicle it will take a long time to speed up slow down and so on
00:40:45 it'll you need to climb up to the thing so it's kind of like really hard to interact with and scheduling too perhaps
00:40:51 when you have more smaller vehicles because closer to BER where you can actually get a personal I mean just the
00:40:59 logistics of getting the vehicle to you it becomes easier when you have a giant shadow there's fewer of them and it
00:41:06 probably goes on a route a specific route that's supposed to hit and when you go on a specific route and all seats
00:41:14 travel together versus you know you have a whole bunch of them you can imagine the route you can still have but you can
00:41:19 imagine you split up the seats and instead of you know damn traveling like I don't know a mile apart they could be
00:41:26 like you know half a mile apart if you split them into two that basically would mean that your delays when you go out
00:41:34 you want wait for them for a long time and that's one of the main reasons or you don't have to climb up the other
00:41:38 thing is that I think if you split them up in a nice way and if you can actually know where people are going to be somehow
00:41:46 you don't even need the app a lot of people ask us the app we say why don't you just walk into the vehicle how about
00:41:52 you just walk into the vehicle it recognizes who you are and it gives you a bunch of options of
00:41:56 places that you go and you just kind of go there I mean people kind of also internalize
00:42:02 the apps everybody needs a nap it's like you don't need an app you just walk into the place walk up but I think I think
00:42:07 one of the things that you know we really try to do is to take that shuttle experience that no one likes and tilt it
00:42:14 into something that everybody loves and so I think that's another important thing I would like to say that carefully
00:42:20 just like today operationally we don't do shuttles you know we're really kind of thinking of this as a system or a
00:42:28 network that we're designing but but ultimately we go to places that would normally rent the shuttle service that
00:42:34 people wouldn't like as much and we want to tilt it into something that people love so you virtually the second earlier
00:42:42 but how many optimist ride vehicles do you think would be needed for any person in Boston or New York if they step
00:42:51 outside there will be this this is like a mathematical question there'll be two optimist ride vehicles within line of sight
00:42:58 is that the right number - well these for example that's that's the density so meaning that if you see one vehicle
00:43:06 you look around you see another one - imagine like you know Tesla will tell you they collect a lot of data do you
00:43:13 see that with Tesla like you just walk around and you look on you see Tesla probably not very specific areas of
00:43:21 California maybe maybe you're right like there's a couple zip codes that you know just but I think but I think that's kind
00:43:26 of important because you know like maybe the couple zip codes the one thing that we kind of depend on I'll get to
00:43:32 your question in a second but now like we're taking a lot of tangents today oh yeah so so so I think that this is
00:43:39 actually important people call this data density or data velocity so it's very good to collect data in a way that you
00:43:46 know you see the same place so many times like you can drive 10,000 miles around the country or you drive 10,000
00:43:54 miles in a confined environment you'll see the same intersection hundreds of times and when it comes to
00:43:59 dick ting what people are gonna do in that specific intersection we become really good at it versus if you draw in
00:44:04 like ten thousand miles around the country you sing that only once and so trying to predict what people do become
00:44:11 sorry and I think that you know you said what is needed it's tens of thousands of vehicles you know you really need to be
00:44:17 like a specific fraction or vehicle like for example in good times in Singapore you can go and you can just grab a cab
00:44:25 and they are like you know 10% 20% of traffic those taxis ultimately that's why you need to get to so that you know
00:44:34 you you get to a certain place where you really the benefits really kick off and like orders of magnitude type of a point
00:44:42 but once you get there you actually get the benefits and you can certainly carry people I think that's one of the things
00:44:49 people really don't like to wait for themselves but for example they can wait a lot more for the goods if they order
00:44:56 something like there you were sitting at home and you want to wait half an hour that sounds great people say it's great
00:45:01 you want to you're gonna take a cab you're waiting half an hour like that's crazy you don't want to wait that much
00:45:07 but I think you know you you can I think really get to a point where the system at peak times really focuses on kind of
00:45:15 transporting humans around and then it's it's really it's a good fraction of traffic to the point where you know you
00:45:20 go you look around there's something there and you just kind of basically get in there and it's already waiting for
00:45:27 you or something like that and then you take it if you do it at that scale like today for instance uber if you talk to a
00:45:36 driver right I mean uber takes a certain cut it's a small cut or drivers would argue that it's a large cut but you know
00:45:44 it's it's it's when you look at the grand scheme of things most of that money that you pay Hueber
00:45:50 kind of goes to the driver and if you talk to the driver the driver will claim that most of it is their time you know
00:45:57 they it's not spent on gas they think it's not spent on the the car per se as much it's like their time and if you
00:46:05 didn't have a have a person driving or if you're in a scenario where you know like point one person is driving the car
00:46:13 a fraction of a person is kind of operating the car because you know your one operates several if you're in that
00:46:20 situation you realize that the internal combustion engine type of cars are very inefficient you know we built them to go
00:46:26 on highways they pass crash tests they're like really heavy they really don't need to be like 25 times the
00:46:32 weight of its passengers or or you know like area wise and so on and but if you get through those inefficiencies and if
00:46:39 you really build like urban cars and things like that I think the economics really starts to check out like to the
00:46:46 point where I mean I don't know you may be able to get into a car and it may be less than a dollar to go from A to B as
00:46:51 long as you don't change your destination you just pay 99 cents and go that if you share it if you take another
00:46:59 stop somewhere it becomes a lot better you know these kinds of things at least four models at least for mathematics and
00:47:07 theory they start to really check out so I think it's really exciting what Optimus Art is doing in terms of it
00:47:13 feels the most reachable like they'll actually be here and have an impact yeah that is the idea and if we contrast that
00:47:21 again we'll go back to our old friends way Moe and Tesla so way Moe seems to have sort of technically similar
00:47:34 approaches as Optimus ride but a different they're not as interested it has having an impact today these in
00:47:43 nature they have a longer term sort of investments almost more of a research project still meaning they're trying to
00:47:50 solve as far as I understand maybe you can you can differentiate but they seem to want to do more unrestricted movement
00:48:00 meaning move from A to B where A to B is all over the place versus Optimus right is really nicely geofence and really
00:48:08 sort of established mobility in a particular environment before you expand it and then Tesla is like the complete
00:48:16 opposite which is you know the entirety of the world actually is going to be automated highway driving urban driving
00:48:24 every kind of driving you know you kind of creep up to it by incrementally improving the capabilities
00:48:33 of the autopilot system so when you contrast all of these and on top of that let me throw a question that nobody likes
00:48:42 but his timeline when do you think each of these approaches loosely speaking nobody can predict the future will see
00:48:50 mass deployment so yah mosque predicts the the craziest approach is at the I've heard figures like at the end of this
00:49:02 year right so that's probably wildly inaccurate but how wildly inaccurate is it I mean first thing to lay out like
00:49:10 everybody else it's really it's really hard to guess I mean I don't know I don't know where where Tesla can look at
00:49:18 or Elon Musk can look at and say hey you know it's the end of this year I mean I don't know what you can look at you know
00:49:25 even the data that you know you I mean if you look at the data even kind of trying to extrapolate the end state
00:49:33 without knowing what exactly is gonna go especially for like a machine learning approach I mean it's just kind of very
00:49:40 hard to predict but I do think the following does happen I think a lot of people you know what they do is that
00:49:46 there's something that I called a couple times time dilation in technology prediction happens let me try to
00:49:53 describe a little bit there's a lot of things that are so far ahead people think they're close and there's a lot of
00:50:00 things that are actually close people think it's far ahead people tries to kind of look at a whole
00:50:05 landscape of technology development admit needs chaos anything can happen in any order at any time and there's a
00:50:12 whole bunch of things in that people take it clamp it and put it into the next three years and so then what
00:50:20 happens is that there's some things that maybe can happen by the end of the year or next year and so on and they push
00:50:25 that into like few years ahead because it's just hard to explain and there are things that are like we were looking at
00:50:33 20 years more maybe you know hopefully in my lifetime type of things and cuz you know we don't know I mean we don't
00:50:41 know how hard it is even like that's a problem we don't know like if some of these problems are actually AI complete
00:50:47 like we have no idea what's going on and and you know we we take all of that and then we clump it and then we say three
00:50:56 years from now and then some of us are more optimistic so they're shooting at the at the end of the year and some of
00:51:01 us are more realistic they say like five years but you know we all I think it's just hard to know and and I think trying
00:51:11 to predict like products ahead to three years it's it's hard to know in the following sense you know like we
00:51:16 typically say okay this is a technology company but sometimes sometimes really you're trying to build something where
00:51:21 technology does like there's a technology gap you know like and Tesla had that with electric vehicles you know
00:51:30 like when they first started they would look at a chart much like a moose law type of chart and they would just kind
00:51:35 of extrapolate that out and they'd say we want to be here what's the technology to get that we don't know it goes like
00:51:41 this so it's probably just gonna you know keep going yeah with bit AI that goes into the cars we don't even have
00:51:49 that like we can't I mean what can you quantify yeah like what kind of chart are you looking at you know but so but
00:51:56 so I think when there's the technology gap it's just kind of really hard to predict so now I realize I talk like
00:52:01 five minutes and avoid your question I didn't tell you anything about and I don't think you I think you've actually
00:52:10 argued that it's not used even NES you provide now is not that used to be very hard there's one thing that I really
00:52:17 believe in and and you know this is not my idea and it's been you know discussed several times but but this this this
00:52:25 kind of like something like a startup or a kind of an innovative company including definitely may want may vary
00:52:32 more Tesla maybe even some of the other big companies that are kind of trying things this kind of like iterated
00:52:38 learning is very important the fact that we're over there and we're trying things and so on I think that's that's
00:52:46 important we try to understand and and I think that you know the coding code Silicon Valley has done that with
00:52:51 business models pretty well and now I think we're trying to get to do it well there's a little technology gap
00:52:58 I mean before like you know you're trying to build I'm not trying to you know I think these companies are
00:53:03 building great technology to for example enable internet search to do it so quickly and that kind of didn't what
00:53:11 wasn't there so much but at least like it was a kind of a technology that you could predict to some degree and so on
00:53:15 and now we're just kind of trying to build you know things that it's kind of hard to quantify what kind of a metric
00:53:23 are we looking at so psychologically is a sort of as a leader of graduate students and an optimist ride a bunch of
00:53:32 brilliant engineers just curiosity psychologically do you think it's good to think that you know whatever
00:53:41 technology gap we're talking about can be closed by the end of the year or do you you know because we don't know so
00:53:50 the way do you want to say that everything is going to improve exponentially to yourself and to others
00:53:57 around you as a leader or do you want to be more sort of maybe not cynical but I don't want to use realistic because it's
00:54:06 hard to predict but yeah maybe more cynical pessimistic about the ability to close again yeah I I think that you know
00:54:14 going back I think that iterated learning is like key that you know you're out there you're running
00:54:19 experiments to learn and that doesn't mean sort of like you know you like like your optimist right you're kind of doing
00:54:25 something but I like in an environment but like what Tesla is doing I think is also kind of like this this kind of
00:54:31 notion and and you know people can go around and say like you know this year next year the other year and so on but
00:54:37 but I think that the nice thing about it is that they're out there they're pushing this technology in I think what
00:54:44 they should do more of I think that kind of informed people about what kind of technology that they're providing you
00:54:48 know the good and the bad and then you know not just sort of you know if it works very well but I think you know I'm
00:54:54 not saying they're not doing bad and informing I think they're kind of trying they you know they put up certain things
00:55:00 or at the very least YouTube videos comes out on on how the summon function works every now and then and and you
00:55:05 know people get informed and so that that kind of cycle continues but you know I I admired I think they're
00:55:12 kind of go out there and they do great things they do their own kind of experiment I think we do our own and I
00:55:19 think we're closing some similar technology gaps but some also some are orthogonal as well you know I think like
00:55:25 like we talked about you know people being remote like it's something or in the kind of environments that we're in
00:55:30 or think about a test the car maybe maybe you can enable it one day like there's you know low traffic like you're
00:55:36 kind of the stuff on go emotion you just hit the button and the you can really say or maybe there's another you know
00:55:41 Lane that you can pass into you going that I think they can enable these kinds of pride believe it and so I think that
00:55:49 that part that is really important and that is really key and and beyond that I think you know when is it exactly gonna
00:55:59 happen and and and so on I mean it's like I said it's very hard to predict and I would I would imagine that it
00:56:07 would be good to do some sort of like a like a one or two year plan when it's a little bit more predictable that you
00:56:12 know you the technology gaps you close and and there and the kind of sort of product that would answer so I know that
00:56:21 from optimist ride or you know other companies that I get involved in I mean at some point you find yourself in a
00:56:28 situation where you're trying to build a product and and people are investing in that in that you know building effort
00:56:36 and those investors that they do want to know as they compare the investments they want to make they do want to know
00:56:41 what happens in the next one or two years and I think that's good to communicate that but I think beyond that
00:56:47 it becomes it becomes a vision that we want to get to someday and saying five years ten years I don't think it means
00:56:53 anything but iterative learning is key though you do and learn I think that is key you know I got a sort of throwback
00:57:03 right at you criticism in terms of you know like Tesla or somebody communicating you know how someone works
00:57:09 and so on I got a chance to visit Optimus ride and you guys are doing some awesome stuff and yet the internet
00:57:15 doesn't know about it so you should also communicate more showing off in showing off some of the awesome stuff
00:57:21 the stuff that works and stuff that doesn't work I mean it's just the stuff I saw with the tracking different
00:57:27 objects and pedestrians so I'm incredible stuff going on there just cool maybe it's just the nerd of me but
00:57:33 I think the world would love to see that kind of stuff yeah that's that's well taken I think you know I should say that
00:57:40 it's not like you know we we weren't able to I think we made a decision at some point that decision did involve me
00:57:50 quite a bit on kind of sort of doing this in kind of coding called stealth mode for a bit but I think that you know
00:57:56 we will open it up quite a lot more and I think that we are also that optimist right kind of hitting when you new era
00:58:05 you know we're big now we're doing a lot of interesting things and and I think you know some of the deployments that we
00:58:11 kind of announced were some of the first bits bits of information that we kind of put out into the world we'll also put
00:58:18 out our technology a lot of the things that we've been developing is really amazing and you know we're gonna we're
00:58:25 gonna start putting it out now we're especially interested in sort of like being able to work with the best people
00:58:30 and I think and I think it's it's good to not just kind of show them and they come to our office for an interview but
00:58:36 just put it out there in terms of like you know get people excited about what we're doing so on Thomas vehicle space
00:58:43 let me ask one last question so yah mosque famously said that lighter is a crutch so  I've talked to a bunch of
00:58:52 people bought it got asked you you use that crutch quite a bit in the DARPA days so you know and is that his idea in
00:59:01 general sort of you know more provocative and fun I think than a technical discussion but the idea is
00:59:08 that camera based can't primarily camera based systems is going to be what defines the future of autonomous
00:59:14 vehicles so what do you think of this idea ladders a crutch versus primarily  camera based systems first things
00:59:23 first I think you know I'm a big believer in just camera based autonomous vehicle systems like I think that you
00:59:30 know you can put in a lot of autonomy and and you can do great things and and it's it's it's very possible that at the time
00:59:38 scales like we said we can't predict twenty years from now like you may be able to do do things that we're doing
00:59:45 today only what lidar and you may be will do them just with cameras and I think that you know you can just I I
00:59:54 think that I will put my name on it to like you know there will be a time when you can only use cameras and you'll be
01:00:02 fine at that time though it's very possible that you know you find the lidar system as another robusta fire or
01:00:10 or it's so affordable that it's stupid not to you know just kind of put it there and I think and I think we may be
01:00:20 looking at a future like that do you think we're over relying on lidar right now because we understand it
01:00:26 better it's more reliable anyways internment from a safety easier to build with that's the other that's the other
01:00:33 thing I think to be very frank with you I mean you know we've seen a lot of sort of autonomous vehicles companies come
01:00:40 and go and the approach has been you know you slap a lidar on a car and it's kind of easy to build with when you have
01:00:47 a lighter are you know you just kind of coat it up and and you hit the button and you do a demo so I think there's
01:00:54 admittedly there's a lot of people they focus on the lidar because it's easier to build with that doesn't mean that you
01:01:00 know without the cameras just cameras you can you cannot do what they're doing but it's just kind of a lot harder and
01:01:06 so you need to have certain kind of expertise to exploit that what we believe in and you know you may be
01:01:13 seeing some of it is that we believe in computer vision we certainly work on computer vision and optimist ride by a
01:01:19 lot like and and we've been doing that from day one and we also believe in sensor fusion so you know we do we have
01:01:27 a relatively minimal use of light ours but but we do use them and I think you know in the future I really believe that
01:01:33 the following sequence of events may happen first things first number one there may be a future in which you know
01:01:40 there's like cars with light hours and everything and the cameras but you know this in this 50 year ahead future they can
01:01:48 drive with cameras as well especially in some isolated environments and cameras they go and they do the thing in the
01:01:53 same future it's very possible that you know the white ARS are so cheap and frankly make the software may be a
01:02:00 little less compute-intensive at the very least or maybe less complicated so that they can be
01:02:07 certified or or insured there of their safety and things like that that it's kind of stupid not to put the lidar like
01:02:15 imagine this you either put pay money for the lidar or you pay money for the compute and if you don't put the lidar
01:02:22 it's a more expensive system because you have to put in a lot of compute like this is another possibility I do think
01:02:28 that a lot of the sort of initial deployments of self-driving vehicles I think they will involve light ARS and
01:02:35 especially either low range or short either short range or low resolution light ARS are actually not that hard to
01:02:43 build in solid state they're still scanning but like MEMS type of scanning light ours and things like that they're
01:02:48 like they're actually not that hard I think they will may be kind of playing with the spectrum and the phaser eyes
01:02:54 they're a little bit harder but but I think like you know putting your mom's mirror in there that kind of scans the
01:03:00 environment it's not hard the only thing is that you know you just like with a lot of the things that we do nowadays in
01:03:06 developing technology you hit fundamental limits of the universe the speed of light becomes a problem in when
01:03:12 you're trying to scan the environment so you don't get either good resolution or you don't get range but but you know
01:03:19 it's still it's something that you can put in that affordably so let me jump back to drones you've  you have a role
01:03:28 in the Lockheed Martin alpha pilot Innovation Challenge where teams compete in drone racing a super cool super
01:03:39 intense interesting application of AI so can you tell me about the very basics of the challenge and where you fit in well
01:03:45 your thoughts are on this problem and it's sort of echoes of the early DARPA challenge in the through the desert that
01:03:53 we're seeing now now with drone racing yeah I mean one interesting thing about it is that you know people drone racing
01:04:02 this is an eSport and so it's much like you're playing a game but there's a real drone going in an environment the human
01:04:08 being is controlling it with goggles on so there's no it is a robot but there's no AI there's no way I am human being is
01:04:16 controlling it and so that's already there and and I've been interested in this problem for quite a while actually
01:04:23 from a robot assist point of view and that's what's happening in alpha pilot which which probably of aggressive
01:04:28 flight of aggressive flight fully autonomous aggressive flight the problem that I'm interested in you asked about
01:04:35 alpha pod and I'll get there in a second but the problem that I'm interested in I'd love to build autonomous vehicles
01:04:42 like like drones that can go far faster than any human possibly can I think we should recognize that we as humans have
01:04:50 you know limitations in how fast we can process information and those are some biological limitations like we think
01:04:57 about this AI this way too I mean this has been discussed a lot and this is not sort of my idea per se but a lot of
01:05:03 people kind of think about human level III and they think that you know AI is not human level one day it'll be human
01:05:08 level and humans in the eyes they kind of interact versus I think that the situation really is that humans are at a
01:05:16 certain place and AI keeps improving and at some point just crosses off and then you know it gets smarter and smarter and
01:05:22 smarter and so drone releasing the same issue humans play this game and you know you have to like react in milliseconds
01:05:31 and there's really you know you see something with your eyes and then that information just flows through your
01:05:36 brain into your hands so that you can command it and there's some also delays and you know getting information back
01:05:41 and forth but suppose a laser don't exist you just just a delay between your eye and your fingers please delay that a
01:05:53 robot doesn't have to have so we end up building in my research group like systems that you know see things at a
01:05:59 kilohertz like a human eye would barely hit a hundred Hertz so imagine things that see stuff in slow motion like 10x
01:06:08 slow motion it will be very useful like we talked a lot about autonomous car so you know we don't get to see it but the
01:06:17 hundred lives are lost every day just in the United States on traffic accidents and many of them are like known cases
01:06:23 you know like the you're coming through like like a ramp going into a highway you hit somebody and you're off or you
01:06:30 know like you kind of get confused you try to like swerve into the next lane you go off the road and you crash
01:06:36 whatever and I'm I think if you had enough computer in a car and a very fast camera right at the time of an accident
01:06:44 you could use all compute you have like you could shut down the infotainment system and use that kind of computing
01:06:51 resources instead of rendering you use it for the kind of artificial intelligence that goes in there the
01:06:58 autonomy and you can you can either take control of the car and bring it to a full stop but even even if you can't do
01:07:03 that you can deliver what the human is trying to do human is trying to change the lane but goes off the road not being
01:07:09 able to do that with motor skills and the eyes and you know you can get in that and I was there's so many other
01:07:15 things that you can enable with what I would call high throughput computing you know data is coming in extremely fast
01:07:22 and in real time you have to process it and the current CPUs have ever fast you clock it are typically not enough you
01:07:32 need to build those computers from the ground up so that they can ingest all that data that I'm really interested in
01:07:39 just on that point really quick is the currently what's the bottom like you mentioned the delays in humans is it the
01:07:46 hardware so you work a lot with NVIDIA hardware is it the hardware is it the software I think it's both I think it's
01:07:53 both in fact they need to be co-developed I think in the future I mean that's a little bit what Nvidia
01:07:58 does sort of like they almost like build the hardware and then they build the neural networks and then they build the
01:08:03 hardware back and the neural networks back and it goes back and forth but it's that Co design and I think that you know
01:08:10 like we try to way back we try to build a faster own that could use a camera image to like track what's moving in
01:08:16 order to find where it is in the world this typical sort of you know visual inertial state estimation problems that
01:08:22 we would solve and you know we just kind of realize that we're at the limit sometimes of you know doing simple tasks
01:08:28 we're at the limit of the camera frame rate because you know you really want to track things you want the camera image
01:08:35 to be 90% kind of like or or some somewhat the same from one frame to the next and why are we at the limit of the
01:08:43 camera frame rate it's because camera captures data it puts it into some serial connection
01:08:49 it could be USB or like there's something called camera serial interface that we use a lot it puts into some
01:08:56 serial connection and copper wires can only transmit so much data and you hit the Shannon limit on copper wires and
01:09:03 you know you you hit yet another kind of Universal limit that you can transfer the data so you have to be much more
01:09:10 intelligent on how you capture those pixels you can take compute and put it right next to the pixels people are
01:09:19 governed all that you do how hard is to get past the bottleneck of the copper wire yeah you need to you need to do a
01:09:26 lot of parallel processing as you can imagine the same thing happens in the GPUs you know like the data is
01:09:32 transferred in parallel somehow it gets into some parallel processing I think that you know like now we're really kind
01:09:38 of diverted off into so many different dimensions but great so its aggressive light how do we make drones see many
01:09:44 more frame just a second in order to enable aggressive fight that's a super interesting problem
01:09:49 that's an interesting problem so but like think about it you have you have CPUs you clock them at you know several
01:09:58 gigahertz we don't clock them faster largely because you know we run into some heating issues and things like that
01:10:03 but another thing is that 3 gigahertz clock light travels kind of like on the order of a few inches or an inch that's
01:10:12 the size of a chip and so you pass a clock cycle and as the clock signal is going around in the chip you pass
01:10:20 another one and so trying to coordinate that the design of the complexity of the chip becomes so hard I mean we have hit
01:10:27 the fundamental limits of the universe in so many things that we're designing I don't know I realize that it's great but
01:10:33 like we can't make transistors smaller because like quantum effects that electrons start to tunnel around
01:10:38 we can't clock it faster one of the reasons why is because like the information doesn't travel faster in
01:10:44 the universe yeah and we're limited by that same thing with the laser scanner but so then
01:10:52 it becomes clear that you know the way you organize the chip into a CPU or even a GPU you now need to look at how to
01:11:00 redesign that if you're gonna stick with silicon yes you could go do other things too I mean there's that too but you
01:11:05 really almost need to take those transistors put them in a different way so that the information travels on those
01:11:12 transistors in a different way in a much more way that is specific to the high-speed cameras coming in and so
01:11:19 that's one of the things that that we talk about quite a bit so drone racing kind of really makes that embodies that
01:11:26 he embodies that and that's what is exciting it's exciting for people you know students like it it embodies all
01:11:33 those problems but going back we're building coding code and other engine and that engine I hope one day we'll be
01:11:41 just like how impactful seatbelts were in in driving I hope so Wow or it could enable your next generation autonomous
01:11:50 air taxis and things like that I mean it sounds crazy but one day we may need to purge that these things if you really
01:11:56 want to go from Boston to New York in more than a half hours you may want to fixed-wing aircraft most of these
01:12:01 companies that are kind of doing Concorde flying cars they're focusing on that but then how do you land it on top
01:12:07 of a building you may need to pull off like kind of fast maneuvers for a robot like perch land it's gonna go perch into
01:12:14 into a building if you want to do that like you need these kinds of systems and so drone racing you know it's being able
01:12:24 to go very faster than anything we can't comprehend take an aircraft forget the quadcopter we take your fixed-wing while
01:12:31 you're at it you might as well put some like rocket engines in the back you just light it you go through the gate and
01:12:37 everyone looks at it and just said what just happened yeah and they would say it's impossible for me to do that and
01:12:43 that's closing the same technology gap that would you know one day steer cars out of accidents so but
01:12:52 let's get back to the practical which is sort of just getting the thing to work in a race environment which is kind of
01:13:00 what the is another kind of exciting thing which the DARPA challenge to the desert did you know theoretically we had
01:13:07 autonomous vehicles but making them successfully finish a race first of all which nobody finished the first year and
01:13:14 then the second year just to get you know to finish and really go at a reasonable time is really difficult
01:13:20 engineering practically speaking challenge so that let me ask about the the Alpha pilot challenge is a I guess a
01:13:29 big prize potentially associated with it but let me ask reminiscent of the DARPA Days predictions you think anybody will
01:13:40 finish well not not soon I think that depends on how you set up the race course and so if the race course is a
01:13:45 slalom course I think people will kind of do it but can you set up some course like literally sunk or you get to design it
01:13:54 there is the algorithm developer can you set up some course so that you can beat the best human when is that gonna happen
01:14:02 like that's not very easy even just setting up some course if you let the human that you're competing with set up
01:14:08 the course it becomes a worries a lot harder so how many in the space of all possible courses are would humans
01:14:18 win and quad machines were a great question let's get to that I want to answer your other question which is like
01:14:24 the DARPA challenge days right what was really hard I think I think we understand we understood what we wanted
01:14:31 to build but still building things that experimentation that iterated learning that takes up a lot of time actually and
01:14:38 and so in my group for example in order for us to be able to develop fast we build like VR environments will take an
01:14:45 aircraft will put it in a motion capture room big huge motion capture room and we'll fly it in real time will render
01:14:53 other images and beam it back to the drone that sounds kind of notionally simple but it's actually hard because
01:14:59 now you're trying to fit all that data through the air into the drone and so you need to
01:15:05 do a few crazy things to make it happen but once you do that then at least you can try things if you crash into
01:15:12 something you didn't actually crash so it's like the whole drone is in VR we can do augmented reality and so on
01:15:19 and so I think at some point testing becomes very important one of the nice things about alpha pilot is that they
01:15:25 built the drone and they build a lot of drones and and it's okay to crash in fact I think maybe you know the viewers
01:15:33 may kind of like to see things that suppose that potentially could be the most exciting part it could be the
01:15:39 exciting part and I think you know as an engineer it's a very different situation to be in
01:15:45 like in academia a lot of my colleagues who are actually in this race and they're really great researchers but
01:15:50 I've seen them trying to do similar things whereby they built this one drone and you know some somebody with like a
01:15:56 face mask and a glows are going you know right behind the drone is trying to hold it if it if it falls down imagine you
01:16:02 don't have to do that I think that's one of the nice things about auto pilot challenge where you know we have this
01:16:08 drones and we're going to design the courses in a way that will keep pushing people up until the crashes start to
01:16:15 happen and you know we'll hopefully sort of I don't think you want to tell people crashing is okay if we want to be
01:16:21 careful here but because you know we don't people to crash a lot but certainly you know we want we want them
01:16:27 to push it so that you know everybody crashes once or twice and and and you know they're really pushing it to their
01:16:33 limits and that's where iterated learning comes in as ever every crash is a lesson is the lesson exactly so in
01:16:39 terms of the space of possible courses how do you think about it in in the in the war of the video versus machines or
01:16:48 do machines when we look at that quite a bit I mean I think that you know you will see quickly that like you can
01:16:55 design a course and you know in in in certain courses like in the middle somewhere if if you kind of run through
01:17:03 the course once you know the Machine gets beaten pretty much consistently by slightly but if you go through the
01:17:11 course like 10 times humans get beaten very slightly but consistently so humans at some point you know you get confused
01:17:17 you get tired and things like that versus machine is just executing the same line of code tirelessly just going back to
01:17:24 the beginning and doing the same thing exactly I think I think that kind of thing happens and I realize sort of as humans
01:17:33 there's the classical things you know that everybody has realized like like if you put in some sort of like strategic
01:17:40 thinking that's a little bit harder for machines that I think sort of comprehend precision is easy to do so that's what
01:17:50 they excel in and also sort of repeatability is easier to do that's what they excel in they can you can
01:17:57 build machines that excel in strategy as well and beat humans that way too but that's a lot harder to build I have a
01:18:03 million more questions but in the interest of time last question yeah what is the most beautiful idea you've come
01:18:09 across in robotics well their simple equation experiment a demo simulation piece of software what
01:18:19 just gives you pause that's an interesting question I have done a lot of work myself in decision making so
01:18:27 I've been interested in that area so you know in robotics you have somehow the field has split into like you know
01:18:33 there's people who would work on like perception how robots perceive the environment then how do you actually
01:18:39 make like decisions and there's people also like how do you interact people interact with drove us is a whole bunch
01:18:44 of different fields and and you know I I have admittedly worked a lot on the more control and decision-making
01:18:52 than the others and I think that you know the one equation that has always kind of baffled me is Bellman's equation
01:19:01 and so it's it's this person who have realized like way back you know more than half a century ago on like how do
01:19:11 you actually sit down and if you have several variables that you're kind of jointly trying to determine how do you
01:19:16 determine that and there is one beautiful equation that you know like today people do
01:19:23 reinforcement where we still use it and and it's it's baffling to me because it both kind of
01:19:31 tells you the simplicity because it's a single equation that anyone can write now we can teach it in the first course
01:19:38 on decision-making at the same time it tells you how computation we how hard the problem is I feel like my like a lot
01:19:44 of the things that I've done at MIT for research has been kind of just this fight against computational efficiency
01:19:50 things like how can we get it faster to the point where we now got to like let's just redesign this chip like maybe
01:19:59 that's the way but I think it talks about how computationally hard certain problems can be by nowadays what people
01:20:08 call curse of dimensionality and so as the number of variables cannot grow the number of decisions you can make grows
01:20:18 rapidly like if you have you know 100 variables each one of them take ten values all possible assignments is more
01:20:24 than the number of atoms in the universe it's just crazy and and that kind of thinking is just embodied in that one
01:20:31 equation that I really like and the beautiful balance between it being theoretically optimal and somehow
01:20:40 practically speaking given the curse of dimensionality nevertheless in practice works among you know despite all those
01:20:47 challenges which is quite incredible it's just quite incredible so you know I would say that it's kind of like quite
01:20:54 baffling actually you know in a lot of fields that we think about how little we know you know like and so I think here
01:21:01 too you know we know that in the worst case things are pretty hard but you know in practice generally things work so
01:21:09 it's just kind of its kind of baffling decision-making how little we know just like how little we know about the
01:21:15 beginning of time how little we know about you know our own future like if you actually go into like from balanced
01:21:23 equation all the way down I mean there's also how little we know about like mathematics I mean we don't even know
01:21:29 the axioms are like consistent it's just crazy yeah yeah I think a good lesson the lesson there just as you said we
01:21:36 tend to focus on the worst case or the the boundaries of everything we're studying and then the average case seems
01:21:41 to somehow work out if you think about life in general we mess it up a bunch you know we
01:21:46 freaked out about a bunch of the traumatic stuff but in the end it seems to work out ok yeah that seems like a
01:21:54 good metaphor sir touch it thank you so much for being a friend a colleague a mentor that really appreciates it on and
