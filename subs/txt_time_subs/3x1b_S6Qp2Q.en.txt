00:00:01 the following is a conversation with vitalik butyrin co-creator of an author of the white paper that launched a
00:00:09 theory 'm and ether which is a cryptocurrency that is currently the second largest digital currency after
00:00:16 bitcoin aetherium has a lot of interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blockchain
00:00:23 technology and metallic is one of the most brilliant people innovating in the space today
00:00:29 unlike Satoshi Nakamoto the unknown person or group that created Bitcoin Vitalik is very well known and at a
00:00:39 young age is thrust into the limelight as one of the main faces of the technology that may redefine the nature

00:04:44 my conversation with vitalik uterine so before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind a theory I'm a
00:04:50 cryptocurrency perhaps it'd be nice to to talk about the the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi
00:04:59 Nakamoto you give a talk that started with sort of asking the question what did Satoshi Nakamoto actually invent
00:05:07 maybe you could say who is so Toshi Nakamoto and what did he invent sure so Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we
00:05:18 know the person who originally came up with Bitcoin so the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is a
00:05:28 yam anonymous fellow who has shown himself to us only over the Internet just step by here first publishing the
00:05:36 white paper for Bitcoin then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin and then talking to the very early Bitcoin
00:05:45 community on Bitcoin forums and and if interacting with that but helping the project along for a couple of years and
00:05:53 then at some point in late 2010 early 2011 he disappeared so Bitcoin is a fairly unique project in
00:06:04 how it has this kind of mythical a kind of quasi godlike founder who just and if pops in he did the thing and
00:06:11 if I disappeared and we were somehow just never heard from him again so in 2008 was so the white paper was the
00:06:17 first do you know the white paper was the first time the name was actually appears that oshina come on leave so so
00:06:26 how is it possible that the creator of such a impactful project remains anonymous that's a tough question
00:06:35 and there's no similarity to it in history of technology as far as I'm aware yeah
00:06:41 so one possibility is that it's healthy knee because healthy knee was and have also active in the Bitcoin community and
00:06:52 as halfa Nia in those two beginning years and how is health any maybe I see you one of the people at the end of
00:07:02 early cypherpunk community he was the computer scientists computer scientists cryptographers people interested in like
00:07:13 technology Internet freedom like those kinds of topics it was the correct that that rather he seemed to have been
00:07:20 involved in either the earliest or the first transaction of bitcoins yes the first transaction of ich werde was
00:07:25 between sister was she had a health in him do you think he knew who Satoshi was if he wasn't Satoshi you probably know
00:07:34 how is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything about their fundamental
00:07:41 identity it is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the Internet like if we were to think about it because you
00:07:50 and I just met now there's a there's a depth of knowledge that we now have about each other that's like physical
00:07:57 like my vision system is able to recognize you I can also verify your identity of
00:08:03 uniqueness like yep this like it's very hard to fake you being you yes so the internet the Internet has a
00:08:10 fundamentally different quality to it which is just fascinating yeah I know definitely interesting as I definitely
00:08:19 just know a lot of people just by their internet and next to me when I think of them like I see their internet handles and one of
00:08:28 them has enough profile picture as this kind of face that's kind of not quite human with about your hand of
00:08:34 psychedelic colors and at and when I visualize him I could just visualize that that's not an actual face yeah you
00:08:43 are the creator of the second well he's currently the second most popular kept across e aetherium so on
00:08:50 this topic if we just stick on Satoshi Nakamoto for a little bit longer you may be the most qualified person to speak to
00:08:57 the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking about mm-hmm like your identity is known like we I've just
00:09:05 verified it but from your perspective what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining
00:09:12 anonymous like if I can psychoanalyze Satoshi Nakamoto is there something interesting there or just a peculiar
00:09:21 quirk of him it definitely helps create this kind of image of this mutual thing that doesn't belong to anyone and then
00:09:32 you've created a project and because you're anonymous and because you also disappear or as unfortunately happened
00:09:40 to help any if that is him he ended up I think dying of abou Gehrig's disease and he's in a cryogenic freezer now but like
00:09:49 if you pop in and you'd and then you created an in you're gone and all that's remaining if that whole process is the
00:10:00 thing itself then like no one can go and try to and if interpret any of your other behavior and try to understand
00:10:09 like oh the like this person wrote this thing in some essay ID at age 16 where he expressed particular opinions about
00:10:17 democracy and so because of that this project is like is a statement that's dragons you this specific thing instead
00:10:27 it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it and it doesn't have the yeah right the the
00:10:33 burden of your other idea political thought and so on so so now then we're sitting with you do you feel
00:10:43 the burden of being kind of the face of aetherium I mean there's a very large community of developers but nevertheless
00:10:50 you know is there like a burden associated with that there definitely is this is definitely a big reason why I've
00:10:59 been trying to kind of push for the etherium ecosystem to become more decentralized in many ways the just
00:11:06 encouraging a lot of kind of core cerium work to happen outside of the etherium foundation and if expanding the number
00:11:12 of people that are making different kinds of decisions having multiple software bill notations instead of one
00:11:18 and all of these things like there's a lot of things that I've tried to do it too and we've removed myself as a single
00:11:26 point of failure because that is something that a lot of people criticize me for so if you look at like the most
00:11:35 fundamentally successful open source projects okay it seems that it's like a sad reality when I think about it is it
00:11:45 seems to be that one person is a crucial contributor often if you look a lioness from from for Linux for the kernel that
00:11:53 is possible and I'm definitely not planning to disappear that's an interesting tension that
00:12:02 projects like this kind of desire a single entity and yet they're fundamentally distributed I don't know
00:12:10 if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking about the future of
00:12:15 cryptocurrency does there need to be a leader there's different kinds of leaders you know there's there's dictators who
00:12:23 control all the money there's people who control organizations there's a kind of high priests that just have themselves
00:12:30 have their twitter followers what kind of leader are you would you say actually a bit more in the hyper in the high
00:12:40 priests direction than before yeah like I definitely actually don't do all that much of kind of going around
00:12:48 and make ordering aetherium foundation people to do things because I think those things are important if there's
00:12:54 something that I do think it's important I use I do just do usually I kind of say it publicly or just gonna say it to
00:13:03 people and quite often projects just gonna start doing it so let's ask the - Safa cool question just about money
00:13:12 yeah what at the highest level is money what is money it's a kind of game and it's a game where we have points and
00:13:21 like if you have points there's this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's
00:13:28 voice by the same number and these it's a fair game hopefully well it's one kind of fair game like for example you know
00:13:34 you can have other kinds of fair games like you're gonna have a game where if I give someone a points and you give
00:13:39 someone a points and instead of that person getting two points that person gets four points and that's also fair
00:13:49 but no money is easy to kind of set up for and it serves a lot of useful functions and so it kind of just
00:13:55 survives in society as a meme for thousands of years it's useful for the storage of wealth useful for the
00:14:04 exchange of value and it's also useful for words and nominating future payments a unit of account
00:14:12 a unit of account so what if you look at the history of money in human civilization what just  if you're a
00:14:21 student of history like how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view even if we just
00:14:28 look at the 20th century before and then leading up to cryptocurrencies that's something think about yeah and I think like the
00:14:36 big thing in the 20th century is kind of we saw a lot more intermediation yes thank you I mean the first part is
00:14:44 and if the move from Bing yeah adding more of different kinds of banking and then we saw the move from
00:14:54 and if dollar is being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold that's only redeemable by certain people $2 not
00:15:03 being backed by anything soo and it's just this new system where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and
00:15:12 then people like I'm getting and if bank accounts and then those things becoming electronic people getting accountable
00:15:17 payment processors that have account bank accounts so so what do you make of that that's a fascinating so philosophical
00:15:27 idea that money might not be backed by anything what is that like the fascinating to you that money can exist
00:15:33 without being backed by something physical it definitely is what do you make of that like how how is that
00:15:41 possible is that stable if you look at the future of human civilization is it possible to have money at the large
00:15:49 scale it such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operate successfully without money being backed
00:15:55 by anything physical feel like the interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that a lot of the
00:16:03 important valuable things are not backed by anything like if you look at like tech companies for example like
00:16:09 something like Twitter and like you could theoretically imagine that if all of the employees wanted to or they could
00:16:16 have kind of come together they would quit and you know start working on Twitter 2.0 and then the yeah of how you
00:16:27 will and just kind of build the exact the the exact same product source possibly build a better product and then
00:16:33 just and if continue on from there and the original the original Twitter would've just not have people left
00:16:39 anymore right like that there is theoretically kind of code and like IP that's owned by the company but
00:16:45 in reality good programmers could probably read up rewrite all that stuff in three months
00:16:53 so the like the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination problems right like
00:16:59 this employees in reality aren't going to switch all at once and also the users aren't all going to switch at once
00:17:05 because it's just difficult for them to switch at once and so there's these and of metastable and of equilibria in
00:17:15 interactions between thousands of millions of people that are just actually quite sticky even though if you
00:17:22 try to kind of assume that everyone's a perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical cow they don't seem
00:17:28 to exist at all this that stickiness do you have a sense a grasp of the sort of the fun fundamental dynamic like the
00:17:36 physics of that stickiness it seems to work but and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it
00:17:45 working yeah it's you know it's the sort of thing that's definitely been have economically modeled a lot I wanna be a
00:17:54 kind of analogy of something as similar that you often see in textbooks as like what is say yeah government like if for exactly
00:18:04 any person if people in a country just like tomorrow suddenly had had the idea that like the laws that are currently
00:18:11 the laws in the government that currently is the government are just people and some of us and some other
00:18:15 thing it is the government and they just kind of start acting like it then that would kind of become the new reality and
00:18:20 then the question is well what happens if and if between 0 and 80 people are it were an 80% if people start believing
00:18:31 that like what is the thing you also you see instead if there is one of these kind of switches happening is kind of
00:18:37 revolution then if you're the first person to join then like you probably probably don't have the incentive to do
00:18:45 that but then if you're the 55th percentile person to join and then suddenly becomes quite safe too and so
00:18:52 this definitely is the sort of thing that you can and if try to analyze it understand mathematically but one of the
00:19:04 and if results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely can be chaotic sometimes yeah but still like
00:19:12 to me the idea that the network effects that the fact that human beings at a scale like millions billions ensure even
00:19:21 the idea of currency big yeah all agree that's just I know I can almost model it I'm a skeptic on the economic it's like
00:19:31 somebody my favorite sort of field maybe recreationally psychology is trying to take human behavior and I think
00:19:37 sometimes people just kind of pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior even though we it's such a
00:19:43 messy space that all the models that psychology or economics those different perspectives on human behavior you can
00:19:51 have or are difficult it's difficult to know how much that's wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting to
00:19:57 the core of understanding human behavior but on that idea what do you think is the role of money in human motivation so
00:20:11 do you think money from an economics perspective from a psychology perspective is core to like human
00:20:19 desires money is definitely very far from the only motivator it is a big motivator and that's one of the closest
00:20:27 things you have to a universal motivator think because ultimately in the almost any person in the world if you ask them
00:20:36 to do something they'll be more inclined to do it if you also offer some offer the money right and that's big there's
00:20:45 definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that maximize how much money they have and
00:20:51 that happens all the time but like though a lot of those other things are kind of but much more specific to and if
00:20:57 who that person is and if where their situation is the relationship between the motive in the action and these other
00:21:03 things what do you think is in the interplay of the other motivator from like Nietzsche perspectives power do you
00:21:10 think money equals power do you think those are conflicting ideas do you think that's the one of the ideas that
00:21:16 decentralized currency decentralized applications are looking at is who holds the power yeah money is definitely a
00:21:25 kind of power and there's definitely people who want money because it gives them power and then even if my money
00:21:35 doesn't seem to and have explicitly be about money a lot of things that people spend money on are ultimately about a
00:21:46 I definitely view those two things as an interplaying and then there's also money as just a way of like measuring how
00:21:56 successful you are I guess a scoreboard right so this kind of gets back to the game like if you have four billion
00:22:04 dollars then the main benefit you get from going out or one of the big benefits you get from going up to six
00:22:09 million dollars is that now instead of being below the guy who has five year above the guy who has five so you think
00:22:17 money could be kind of in a game of life it's also a measure of self-worth it's like how we it's definitely how I have a
00:22:25 lot of people perceive it define ourselves you know hierarchy of yeah I'm not yeah not saying it's kind of a
00:22:33 healthy thing that people define yourself worthless money because it's definitely and of far from a perfect
00:22:42 indicator of how much you like you value you provide the Society or anything like this but I definitely think that they as
00:22:49 a matter of kind of current practice a bunch of people do feel that way so what does utopia from an economic perspective
00:22:58 look like to you what is the perfect world look like I guess The Economist's utopia would be
00:23:09 one where kind of everything is an incentive aligns in the same in the sense that there aren't enough conflicts
00:23:16 between what satisfies your goals and kind of what is good for and if everyone in the world in the world as a whole
00:23:25 what do you think that would look like this does that mean they're still poor people and rich people they're still income
00:23:34 inequality do you think sort of Marxist ideas are strong do you think sort of ideas of Objectivism
00:23:43 like where the market rules is strong like what is there is the different economic philosophies that just seem to
00:23:52 be reflective what utopia would be no I definitely think that existing economic philosophy is do end up kind of
00:24:02 systematically deviating from the utopia in a lot of ways yeah like one of the big things I talk about for example is
00:24:09 public goods right and public goods are especially important on the Internet right yes like the idea is what kind of
00:24:16 money as this game where you know I was a few coin a few coins and you gain the same number of coins is that this
00:24:22 usually happens in a trade where I lose some money you gain some money you lose a sandwich and I gain a sandwich and
00:24:32 this and if model works really well when the thing that were using money to incentivize this kind of private goods
00:24:38 right things that you provide to one person where the benefit comes to one person but the like on the internet
00:24:46 especially but also many many contexts and if off the internet there's actions that and if individuals or groups can
00:24:54 take where instead of the benefit going to one person the benefit just goes to many people at the same time and you
00:25:01 can't control where the benefit goes to right so for example this podcast I know we publish it and when it's published
00:25:09 you don't have any fine-grained control over like oh these 38,000 people can watch it and then like these other
00:25:16 29,000 people can't it's like once the number goes high enough then you know people just like copy it and then when I
00:25:23 write articles on a blog then they're just like free for everyone and that stuff's even harder to prevent anyone
00:25:30 from copying so and aside from that things like you know scientific research for example and even taking more
00:25:38 pedestrian examples like climate change mitigation would be a big one so there's a lot of things in the world
00:25:47 where you have these kind of individual actions with have concentrated cost and distributed benefits and money as a
00:25:54 point system does not do a good job of encouraging these things and one of the kind of other things even tangentially
00:26:03 connected to crypto but kind of theoretically outside of it that I work on is this sort of mechanism called
00:26:10 quadratic funding and the way to think about it is I and I've imagined a point system where if like if one person gives
00:26:21 coin gives points to one other person then it works the same way as money but if multiple people and give coins to one
00:26:30 person and they do so anonymously so it's kind if not in consideration for a specific service to that person
00:26:35 themselves and then the number of Quinns are received by that person and of greater than just the
00:26:42 sum of the number of coins that have given by those different people so the actual formula is you take the square
00:26:49 root of the amount that each person gave then you add all the square roots so then you're going to square the sums
00:26:54 because yeah and then you give that and the idea here would basically be that if let's say for example you just started
00:27:03 going off and kind of planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people that are really happy that you're planting
00:27:09 trees so that so they go and all kind of throw a coin your way then the like there is like basically the fact that
00:27:18 kind of you get more than the sum you get this kind of square of some of these of a square root some of these tiny
00:27:25 amounts as that this actually and if compensates for the tragedy of the Commons rightness there is even this
00:27:30 kind of mathematical proof that it's sort of optimally compensates for it what is the tragedy of the Commons this
00:27:38 is just this idea that if there is this situation where there's some public good that lots of people benefit from then no
00:27:46 individual person wants to contribute to it because if they contribute to only get a small part of the benefit from
00:27:52 their contribution but they pay the full cost of their contribution in which context is this sorry what is the term
00:28:01 quadratic quadratic funding like what's in which context is this mechanism useful so obviously you said to combat
00:28:10 the tragedy of the Commons but you know in which context do you see it as useful in practice yes theoretically public
00:28:17 goods in general right so like like services like what do we what are we talking about what's the public within
00:28:24 the etherium ecosystem for example like we've actually tried using this mechanism I wrote a couple of articles
00:28:31 about the Senate on Vitalik CA where it goes through some of the most recent rounds and it's been really interesting
00:28:36 some of the top ones that people supported there were things like you can just unwind user interfaces that make it
00:28:46 easier for people to interact with etherium there was documentation there are podcasts there were you know
00:28:59 software and of clients like kind of implementations of the etherium protocol of privacy tools just like lots of
00:29:08 things that are gonna be useful to lots of people wouldn't a lot of people are contributing for like funding a
00:29:14 particular take care entity yeah and it's really actually interesting is there something special about the
00:29:20 quadratic the the the summing of the square roots yeah so another way to think about it is like imagine if n
00:29:27 people each give a dollar then the person gets N squared right and and so each individual person's contribution
00:29:35 gets multiplied by n because you have n people and so that kind of perfectly compensates for the kind that kind of
00:29:41 end to one tragedy over the comments I just wonder if the squared part is yeah fundamental though it is an Ida
00:29:49 recommend you go to Vitalik CA I have this article called quadratic payments of primer and highly
00:29:58 recommended it's kind of at least my attempt so far and if exploiting the intuition behind this intuition so if we
00:30:04 could can we go to the the very basic what is the blockchain or perhaps we might even start at the the
00:30:15 Byzantine generals problem and presenting fault tolerance in general that I big coin was taking steps to
00:30:26 providing a solution for so the Byzantine generals problem it's this paper that Leslie Lamport published in
00:30:35 1982 where she has thought experiments where if you have two generals that are camped out on opposite sides of a city
00:30:43 and they're planning when to attack the city then the question is and if how could those generals coordinate with
00:30:51 each other and they could send messengers between each other but those messengers and if could get sniped by
00:30:59 the enemy on the row road some of those messages could end up being traitors and if things could end up happening and
00:31:07 with just two mess generals it turns out that there's and if no solution and a finite number
00:31:16 of rounds that guarantee is dead they will be able to end of coordinate on the same answer but then in the case where
00:31:22 you have more than two generals that then Leslie analyzes cases like are the mess and message is kind of just oral
00:31:31 messages are the messages kind of signed messages so I can give you a man assigned messages and you can pass along
00:31:37 that signed message and the third party could still verify that I originally made that message and depending on those
00:31:44 different cases there's kind of different bounds on like given how many generals and how many traders among
00:31:53 those generals so I move whether like under what conditions you actually can't agree once I launch an attack so it's
00:32:01 actually a big misconception that the the Byzantine generals problem was unsolved so let's go import solve that
00:32:07 the thing that was unsolved though is that all of these solutions assume that you've already agreed on and I'm affixed
00:32:14 a list of who the generals are and these generals have to be a kind of semi trusted to some extent they can't just
00:32:18 be anonymous be because if they're anonymous stand like the enemy could just be 99% of the
00:32:29 generals  so I'm in the 1980s and the 1990s head of the general use case for distributed system stuff was more and if
00:32:38 enterprise-e stuff where you could and have assumed that no you know who the nodes are that are running the sign of
00:32:47 computer networks so if he wants to have some movement of decentralized computer network that pretends to be a single
00:32:52 computer and that you can kind of do a do and of operations on then it's made out of these and a fifty in specific
00:33:00 computers and we know and if who and where they are and so we have a good reason to believe that say at least
00:33:05 eleven of that would be fine and it could also be within a single system yes exactly almost a network of devices sensors you
00:33:13 know on like in air airplanes and I think like flight systems generally use these kinds of ideas yep yep so that's
00:33:20 the eighties that's the eighties and nineties now the cypherpunks had a different use case in mind which was
00:33:26 that they wanted to create a yeah for a decentralized global permission was currency and the problem here is that
00:33:34 they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want any kind of privilege the list of people and so now
00:33:41 the question is well how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of
00:33:48 measuring identities right you have no way of kind of determining whether or not some 99% of participants aren't
00:33:56 actually all the same guy and so the clever solution that's it was she had this is and if going back to the that
00:34:03 presentation I made a Def Con a few months ago where I said that the things that o she invented was crypto economics
00:34:11 is this a really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind of all admit identity how many identities you
00:34:21 can get and the if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency that the only way to do this is with
00:34:27 proof of work right so with proof of work the solution is just you publish a solution to a hard
00:34:38 mathematical puzzle that takes some and if clearly calculable amount of computational power to solve you get an
00:34:45 identity and then you solve a five of those puzzles you get five identities and then these are the identities that
00:34:51 we run the kids not this algorithm between so the proof-of-work mechanism you just described is like the
00:34:58 fundamental idea proposed in in the white paper that defines bitcoin what's the idea of consensus that we wish to
00:35:09 reach what wise consensus important here what is consensus so the goal here in just simple technical terms yes to kind
00:35:22 of wire together a set of a large number of computers in such a way that they kind of pretends to the outside world to
00:35:29 be a single computer where that single de pute er keeps working even if a large portion of the kind of constituents the
00:35:35 computers that make it up break it kind of break in arbitrary ways like they could shut off they could try to
00:35:41 actively break a system they could do lots of mean things so the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this is
00:35:50 because they wanted to run one particular program on this virtual computer and the one particular program
00:35:55 that they wanted to run is just a currency system right it's a system that just processes a series of transactions
00:36:03 and for every transaction it verifies that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction it verifies that the
00:36:10 digital signature is correct and if the checks pass then it subtracts the coins from one accounts and adds the coins to
00:36:17 the other account roughly so first of all the the proof of work idea is kind of I mean at least to me seems pretty
00:36:26 fascinating it is I mean that's a it's kind of a revolutionary idea is it is it obvious to come up with that you can use
00:36:34 you can exchange basically computational resources for for identity it's it actually has a pretty long history it
00:36:44 was first proposed in a paper by a Cynthia to work in a or in 1994 I believe and the
00:36:53 original use case was a combating email spam so the idea is that if you send an email you have to send it with a
00:36:59 proof-of-work attached and like this makes it reasonably cheap to send emails to your friends but it makes it really
00:37:04 expensive to send spam to a million people yeah that's a simple brilliant idea so maybe also taking a step back so
00:37:13 what is the role of blockchain in this what is blockchain sure so the blockchain I mean my way of thinking
00:37:20 about it is that it is this and if system where you have this kind of one virtual computer created by this
00:37:30 a bunch of these of nodes in the network and the reason why the term blockchain is used is because the data structure
00:37:37 that these systems use at least so far is one where they even if different nodes in the network periodically
00:37:48 published blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions together with a pointer like a hash of a previous block
00:37:57 that it builds on top of and so you have a series of blocks that that no one's in the network create for each block points
00:38:04 to the previous block and so you have this chain of them is a fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of
00:38:11 blockchain there's a lot of possibilities I've got a ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on
00:38:18 there are indeed a lot of possibilities so in Egan and just simple architecture as I just described is the way the fault
00:38:25 tolerance happens it's like this right so you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily and if occasionally
00:38:31 creating blocks building on top of each other's blocks and let's say you have kind of one block we'll call it kind of
00:38:38 block one yeah and then someone else builds another block honestly we'll call it block two then we have an attacker
00:38:45 and what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries to revert block two and the way the revert block two is instead
00:38:51 of doing the thing they're supposed to do which is build a block on top of block two they're gonna build another
00:38:58 block on top of block one so you have block one which has two children block two in the
00:39:03 walk to prime now this light sometimes even happened by random chance if you know two nodes in the network
00:39:09 just happened to create blocks at the same time and then over here about each other's things before they create their
00:39:14 own but this also could happen because of an attack now if this happens you have an attack then we know in the
00:39:23 Bitcoin system the nodes follow the longest chain so if this attack had happened and if when the original chain
00:39:33 had more than two blocks on its know if it was trying to kind of revert more than more than two blocks then everyone
00:39:40 would just taken one just ignore it and everyone would just keep following the regular chain but here you know we have
00:39:45 walked two and we have walked two prime and snow this you were kind of even and then whatever block the next block is
00:39:53 created on top of so say block three is now created on top of block two prime then everyone says agrees that block
00:40:02 three is than you had and block two prime is just kind of forgotten and then everyone just kind of peacefully builds
00:40:08 on top of block 3 anything continues so how difficult is it to mess with the system I know so how like if we look at
00:40:16 the general problem like how many what fraction of people who participate in the system have to be bad players in
00:40:25 order to mess with actually like what's your is there is there a good number areas well depending on kind of what
00:40:32 your model of the participants is and like what kind of attack we're talking about it's anywhere between twenty three
00:40:41 point two and fifty percent of what of all of the computing power in the network sorry so twenty two and twenty
00:40:48 or three point between twenty three point zero and 50% and 50% are can be compromised so like once you're once
00:40:58 your purse your portion of the total computing power the network goes above the twenty three point two level then
00:41:05 there's and if things that you could mean things that you can potentially do and as your percentage of the network
00:41:11 kind of keeps going up then the your abilities does you mean things kind of goes higher and then if you have
00:41:15 about 50% then you can just break everything so how hard is it to achieve that level like it seems that so far
00:41:24 historically speaking it's been exceptionally difficult so this is a challenging question so the economic
00:41:32 cost of acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is fairly high I think it's somewhere in the low billions of dollars
00:41:40 and when you say that stuff you mean computational resources yeah so specifically specialized hardware and of
00:41:48 Asics that people use to solve these puzzles to do the mining small tangent so obviously I work a lot in deep
00:41:56 learning with GPUs and Asics for that application and I tangentially kind of here that's so many of these you know
00:42:04 sometimes NVIDIA GPUs are sold out because because of this other application that would do work if you
00:42:10 can come out I don't know if you're familiar or interested in the space what kind of Asics what kind of hardware is
00:42:18 generally used these days for the to do the actual computation for the proof-of-work sure so in the case in Bitcoin and
00:42:24 etherium are a bit different so in the case of Bitcoin there is an algorithm called sha-256 it's just a hash function
00:42:32 and so the puzzle is just coming up with a number where the hash of the number is below some threshold and so because the
00:42:38 hashes are designed to be random you just have to keep on trying different numbers until one works and the Asics
00:42:45 are just like specialized store gets to contain and if circuits for evaluating this hash over and over again and you
00:42:53 have like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacked on top of each other inside of a box and you
00:43:00 just keep on running the box 24/7 and the issues there's literally specialized hardware design for this yes oh this is
00:43:06 we live in an amazing world another tangent and I'll come back to the basics but this quantum computing throw a
00:43:14 wrench into any of this very good question so what quantum computers have two main and a families of algorithms that are
00:43:22 relevance to cryptography one is a Shor's algorithm ensures algorithm is one of kimbley
00:43:31 he breaks the hardness of some specific kinds of mathematical problems so the one that you've probably heard of is it
00:43:37 makes it very easy to factor numbers so it figure out kind of what prime factors are they're kind of that you need to
00:43:42 multiply together to get some number even if that number is extremely big Shor's algorithm can also be used to
00:43:51 break and look to curve cryptography it can break like any kind of hit an order group so it breaks a lot of kind of
00:43:58 cryptographic nice things that we're used to but the good news is that for every and of major use of things that
00:44:08 Shor's algorithm breaks we already know of quantum proof alternatives now these we don't use these quantum proof
00:44:14 alternatives yet because in many cases they're faster ten times what sufficient but and the crypto industry in general
00:44:22 kind of knows that this is coming eventually and it's kind of ready to take the hit and switch to that stuff
00:44:29 when we when we have to the second algorithm that is the relevant to cryptography is Grover's algorithm and
00:44:37 in Grover's algorithm might even be a more familiar to AI people that's basically usually described as solving
00:44:45 search problems them but the idea here is that if you have a problem over the form find a number that satisfies some
00:44:54 property then if with a classical computer you needs to try and have n times before before you find a number
00:45:01 then with a quantum computer you only need to do square root of n computations and the Grover's could potentially be
00:45:11 used for mining but there's two possibilities here one is that Grover's could be used for
00:45:17 mining and whoever creates the first working quantum computer that could do Grover's will just mind way faster than
00:45:23 everyone else and we'll see another round of what we saw when a six came out which is that kind of the new hard were
00:45:29 just kind of dominated the old stuff and then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium but by the way way faster
00:45:36 not exponentially faster quadratic we found radically faster which is not sort of 
00:45:43 it's not game-changing I would say it's like a sex like you said it would be exactly yes so it would not necessarily
00:45:50 break proof-of-work as of this right yeah yeah the other kind of possible world right is that quads are computers
00:45:57 have a lot of overhead there's a lot of Anacapa like city involved in maintaining quantum states and there's
00:46:03 also as we've been realizing recently meeting quantum computers were actually work requires that have quantum error
00:46:10 correction which requires kind of a thousand real qubits per logical qubit and so there's the very real possibility
00:46:17 that the overhead of running a quantum computer will be higher than the speed-up you get with Grover's which
00:46:22 would be kind of sad but which would also mean that given proof of work we'll just keep working fine so the
00:46:30 beautifully put soso proof of work is the core idea of Bitcoin is there are other core ideas before we kind of take
00:46:36 a step towards the origin story and ideas of aetherium is there other stuff that will key to the white paper of
00:46:43 Bitcoin there is proof of work and then there's just the cryptography it just kind of public keys and signatures that
00:46:50 are used to verify transactions those two are the big things so then what is the origin story maybe the human side
00:46:57 but also the technical side of aetherium sure so I joined the Bitcoin community in 2011 you know they started by just
00:47:07 writing I first wrote for the sort of online thing called Bitcoin weekly then I started writing for Bitcoin magazine
00:47:16 you know sorry to interrupt you have this funny kind of story true or not is that you were disillusioned by the
00:47:26 downsides of centralized control from your experience with Wow world of warcraft is this true or you're just
00:47:32 being woody I mean the event is true the fact that that's the reason I do decentralization is witty maybe just a
00:47:40 small tangent have you always had a skepticism of centralized control is that sloppy Korea has that feeling
00:47:49 evolved over time or is that just always been a core feeling that decentralized control is the future of
00:47:56 human society it's definitely been something that felt very attractive to me ever since I could afford that such a
00:48:03 thing is possible yeah they're so great so you're you joined the Bitcoin community in 2011 you say you began
00:48:09 writing so what what's next started writing moved from high school to university a half way in between that
00:48:20 spent a year in university then at the end of that year I had dropped out to do Bitcoin things full-time and this was a
00:48:28 combination of continuing the right Bitcoin magazine but also increasingly work on software projects and I traveled
00:48:36 around the world for about six months and just going to different Bitcoin communities like I went to first in New
00:48:42 Hampshire then Spain other European places I'm Israel then San Francisco and along the way and have met a lot of other
00:48:49 people that are working on different Bitcoin projects and when I was in Israel there were some kind of very
00:48:56 smart teams there that were working on ideas that people were starting to kind of called Bitcoin 2.0 so one of these
00:49:03 worse colored coins which is basically saying that hey let's not just use the blockchain for Bitcoin but let's also
00:49:10 kind of issue other kinds of assets on it and then there is a protocol called master coin that supported issuing
00:49:16 assets but also supported many other things like financial contracts like domain name registration and a lot of
00:49:26 different things together and I spent some time working with these teams and I quickly kind of realized that this
00:49:35 master coin protocol could be improved by kind of generalizing it more right so the best the analogy I use is that the
00:49:40 master coin protocol was like the Swiss Army knife you have 25 different transaction types for 25 different
00:49:48 applications but what I realized is that you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more general-purpose so
00:49:55 one of them was that you could replace like three transaction types for three types of financial contracts with a
00:50:03 generic transaction type for a financial contract so just what you specify mathematical formula for kind of
00:50:09 gurgi how much money each side gets by the way it's a small pause what's you say financial contract just the
00:50:15 terminology what is the contract what's a financial contract so the a this is just generally an agreement
00:50:24 where I know if either one or two parties kind of put collateral or kind of in and then they depending on and if
00:50:32 certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets this could involve different the actions of the two
00:50:39 parties could involve other things but they you kind of get rid of different amounts of and of assets out that it'll
00:50:45 just depend on things that happened so a contract is really a financial contract as at the core it's the it's the core
00:50:52 interactive element of a financial system yeah there's there's many different kinds of financial contracts
00:50:58 like there's things like options where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you have for some
00:51:04 specific price for some period of time there's contracts for difference where you basically are kind of making a bet
00:51:13 that says like for every dollar this thing goes up I'll give you $7 or for every dollar the thing goes down you
00:51:19 give me $7 or something like that you know but the main idea that these contracts have to be enforced and
00:51:25 trusted then yes exactly you have to trust that they will work out in a system where nobody can be trusted yes
00:51:33 this is such a beautiful complicated system okay so so you're seeking to kind of generalize this basic framework of
00:51:44 contracts so what is that entail so what what technically are the steps to creating aetherium sure so I guess just
00:51:52 they're going to continue a bit with this master coin story term so started by and of giving ideas for how to
00:52:00 generalize the thing and eventually this turned into a much more kind of fully fledged proposal that just says hey how
00:52:05 about you scrap all your future is and instead you just put in this programming language and I gave this idea to them
00:52:13 and their response was something like hey this is great but this seems complicated and this seems like
00:52:18 something that's we're not gonna be able to put onto a road map for a while and my response to this was like wait do
00:52:24 you not realize how revolutionary this is well just go do it myself and then I was the name of the programming approach
00:52:31 I just called it ultimate scripting great so then I kind of went through a couple more rounds of iteration and then
00:52:42 the idea for aetherium itself started to form and the idea here is that you just have a blockchain where the core unit of
00:52:53 the thing is what we call contracts as these and if accounts that can hold assets and like they have their own
00:53:00 internal memory but that are controlled by a piece of code and so if I send some ether to a contract the only thing that
00:53:09 can determine where that and if either the currency inside etherium item goes after that is the code of that contract
00:53:19 itself and so basically you're kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this kind of paradigm for
00:53:27 creating these sort of agreement self executing agreements self executing as so cool that code is sort of part of
00:53:34 this contract so that that's what's meant by smart contracts yeah so how hard was it to build this kind of thing
00:53:43 harder than expected I mean originally I actually thought that this would be a thing that I would kind of casually work
00:53:48 on for a couple of months published and then go back to university then I released it and a bunch of people or I
00:53:58 released a white paper white paper that paper a whole bunch of people came in offering how about huge number of people
00:54:06 and have expressed interest and this was something I was totally not expecting and then I kind of realized that this
00:54:13 would be something that's kind of much bigger than I had ever thought that it would be and then we started on this
00:54:22 kind of much longer development slog of making something that lives up to this sort of much higher level of
00:54:30 expectations what if this some of those is it fundamentally software engineering challenges your whether social okay so
00:54:38 there's a social so so what are the biggest interesting challenges that you've learned about human civilization
00:54:44 and engine software engineering through this process so I guess one of the challenges for me is that like I'm one
00:54:54 of the I know apparently unusual geeks course and have never treated with anything but kindness in school yes and
00:55:04 so when I got into crypto I kind of expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind of altruistic and nice in
00:55:13 that same way but the and if the algorithm that I used for finding co-founders for this thing was not very
00:55:18 good it was literally what computer scientists called the greedy algorithm it's said of the first 15 people who
00:55:24 replied back offering to help and if I were the co-founders do you mean like literally the people that four will form
00:55:32 the founders cofounders of the community the algorithm I like how you call it the algorithm yeah and so what happened was
00:55:43 that these but especially as the project got really big like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and
00:55:49 there are a lot of like I wanted the thing to be a non-profit and some of them wanted to be a for-profit and then
00:55:56 there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each other there were people that were kind
00:56:03 of trying to get an advantage for themselves in a lot of different ways and this just about six months later
00:56:11 went to this big governance crisis and then we got a reshuffled leadership a bit and then the project kept on going
00:56:19 then nine months later there was another governance crisis and then there was a third governance crisis and so is there
00:56:26 a way to looking at the human side of things is there a way to optimize this aspect of the cryptocurrency world it
00:56:34 seems that there is from my perspective there's a lot of different characters and personalities and egos and like you
00:56:44 said I don't know if you know I also like to think that most of the world mostly people in the world are
00:56:50 well-intentioned but the way those intentions are realised may perhaps come off as you know as negative like what is
00:57:01 there is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency that where everyone
00:57:08 gets along and after about four rounds of reshuffle like I think we've actually come up with something that seems to be
00:57:18 pretty stable and happy and I think I mean I definitely do think that you know most people are well-intentioned I just
00:57:26 think that like one of the reasons why I like decentralization is just because there's like this thing about power
00:57:32 where power attracts people with egos and so that just allows a very small percentage of people to just ruin so
00:57:39 many things you think he goes  you think ego has a use like is he go always bad it seems like sometimes does but
00:57:48 Scindia theory research team I feel like we've found also kind of a lot a lot of very good people that are just gonna
00:57:58 primarily you're just interested in things for the technology and the thing says seem to just generally be going
00:58:07 quite well yeah when you're when the focus and the passion is an attack so on the so that's the human side of things
00:58:13 but and the technology side like what have you learned what would have been the biggest challenges of bringing
00:58:20 aetherium to life on the technology side so I think first of all just you know there's like the first law of software
00:58:29 development which is that when someone gives you a timetable of which the unit of time to the next largest unit of time
00:58:35 and add one he's like we basically fell victim to that and so instead of taking this at like three months it ended up
00:58:47 taking like 20 months to watch the thing that was just I think under estimating the sheer technical complexity over the thing
00:58:55 there were research challenges like so for example one of the things that we've been saying
00:59:00 from the start that we would do one is a switch from a proof of work to a proof of stake more proof of stake is this
00:59:08 alternative consensus mechanism where instead of there having to waste a lot of a computing power on solving these
00:59:13 mathematical Possible's that don't mean anything you kind of proved that you have access to coins inside of the
00:59:21 system and this gives you some level of participation in the consensus can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit I
00:59:27 understand the idea of proof of work I know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of stake is really
00:59:33 appealing can maybe linger on a longer explain what it is sure so basically the idea is like if I kind of a walk up a
00:59:45 hundred coins then I turned that into a kind of court virtual Minor and the system itself I kind of automatically in
00:59:53 a random way assigns that in a virtual minor is a right to create blocks at particular intervals and then if someone
01:00:00 else has 200 coins and then a walk on the walk there's 200 coins then they get a kind of twice as big a virtual minor
01:00:07 they'll be able to create blocks twice as often good so it tries to do similar things to proof of work except instead
01:00:16 of the thing and if very limiting your participation being your ability to crank out its solutions to and if hash
01:00:24 challenges the thing that real love is your participation is kind of how much coins you're walking into this mechanism
01:00:30 okay so interesting so that that limit of participation doesn't require you to run a lot of compute mmm-hmm
01:00:40 does that mean that the richer you are so rich people are more like their identities more right and this stable
01:00:53 yeah verifiable or whatever whatever the right terminology is right and this is definitely a copied critique I think my
01:01:01 usual answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind of thing exactly yeah I didn't mean it
01:01:06 investing there's a criticism I think you're exactly right that's equivalent the proof of work is the same
01:01:13 kind of thing but before work you have to also use physical resources yes and burn computers and burn trees and all of
01:01:21 that stuff is there a way to mess with the system of the proof of proof of stake there is but you will once again
01:01:29 need to have a very large portion of all the coins that are locked in the system to do anything bad
01:01:35 got it yeah and just to that maybe take a small change and one of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact that it
01:01:42 gets for the proof of work mechanism you have to use so much energy in the world yes is one of the motivations of proof
01:01:49 of stake is to move away from this definitely like what's your sense of it maybe I'm just under informed is there
01:01:57 like legitimately environmental impact from this yeah so the latest thing was that Bitcoin consumed as much energy as
01:02:05 the country of Austria or something like that yeah and then etherium is like right now me only like half an order of
01:02:11 magnitude smaller than Bitcoin I've heard you talking about a theorem 2.0 so what's the what's the dream of a theorem
01:02:21 2.0 what's the the status of proof of stake is the mechanism that a theory moves towards and also how do you move
01:02:28 to a different mechanism of consensus sure that within a cup of currency so theorem 2.0 is a collection of major
01:02:36 upgrades that we've wanted to do to aetherium for quite some time the two big ones one is upper of steak and the
01:02:44 other is so we call sharding sharding solves another problem with block chains which is a scalability and what sharding
01:02:52 does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network having to personally download and verify every
01:02:58 transaction everybody else pins in the network only downloads and verifies a small portion of transactions eelain's
01:03:05 you kind of randomly distribute who gets how much work and because the issue of how the distribution is random it still
01:03:12 has the property that you need a large portion of the entire network to corrupt what's going on inside of any shard but
01:03:20 the system is still in a very redundant and very secure how hard is that to implement and how
01:03:28 hard is proof of stake to implement like on a technical level yes after level proof of stake in charting are both
01:03:35 challenging might say charting is a bit more challenging the reason is that proof of stake is can have just I
01:03:42 changed the causa consensus or works sharding does both that but it's also a change to the networking layer the
01:03:48 reason is that charting is kind of pointless if at the networking layer you still do what you do today which is you
01:03:54 kind of gossip everything which means that if someone publishes something every other node and the client Sears it
01:04:00 a like from on the networking layer and so instead we have to have and if sub networks and the ability to quickly
01:04:05 switch between sub networks and other sub networks talk to each other and this is all doable but it's say yeah more
01:04:12 complex architecture and it's definitely the sort of thing that it has not yet been done in cryptocurrencies so most
01:04:18 most of the networking layer in cryptocurrency is you're shouting like broadcast messages and this is more like
01:04:26 ad hoc networks like yeah you're shouting within smaller groups small group but do you have like a bunch of
01:04:32 sub note like exactly you have to switch between ah man I'd love to see that there's a beautiful idea so from a graph
01:04:41 theoretic perspective but just the software that who's responsible is a theorem project like the people involved
01:04:48 would they be implementing like what's the actual you know this is like legit software engineering who like how does
01:04:56 that work how do people collaborate build that kind of project is this like almost like is there a software
01:05:05 engineering lead is there it's like is it legit almost like large-scale open-source projects
01:05:12 yeah so we have someone named Danny Ryan on our team has just been brilliant and great all around and he is a kind of de
01:05:21 facto kind of development coordinator I guess it's like you have to invent job titles for this stuff as the reason is
01:05:28 that look we also have this unique kind of organizational structure where they theorem foundation itself and of does
01:05:34 research in-house but then the actual implementation is by independent teams that are separate
01:05:40 companies and they're located all around the world and fun places like Australia and and so no you can kind of just need
01:05:51 a bunch of and have almost non-stop cat herding to just keep getting these people to have talked to each other and
01:05:57 never kind of implement this back make sure that everyone agrees on mind of what what's going on and kind of how to
01:06:03 interpret different things so how far into the future are we from these two mechanisms and etherium 2.0 like what's
01:06:09 what's your sense of the timeline keeping in mind the previous comment you made about the sort of general curse of
01:06:20 software projects so if the REM 2.0 is split into three phases so face gyro just creates a proof stake network and
01:06:28 it's actually separate from and of proof of the proof of work network at the beginning just and if give it time to
01:06:35 grow and improve itself do people get to choose sorry to interrupt if people get to choose I guess yes you can think yes
01:06:41 I choose to move over if they want to then phase one adds sharding but it only adds sharding of and of data storage and
01:06:49 not charting of computation and then after that there is and if the merger phase which is where the yeah and if the
01:06:57 accounts kind of smart contracts like all of the an activity and a the existing is one system just kind of gets
01:07:04 cut and pasted into eighth - and then the proof of work chain gets forgotten and then and things all the things that
01:07:09 we're living there before you're just kind of continual living inside of the pro stake system so for timelines um
01:07:22 phase zero has been kind of almost fully implemented and now it's just a matter of a whole bunch of security auditing
01:07:31 and testing my own experience is that right now it feels like right about a phase comparable to when we were doing
01:07:40 the original aetherium launch when we were maybe about four months away from launch that's just a hunch then that's just a
01:07:48 hunch yeah so how you know it took took over a decade for people to move from Python to to Python 3 how do you see the
01:07:59 move from like this phase of 0 of 4 for different consistent mechanism do you see there being a drastic phase shift in
01:08:07 people just kind of jumping to this better mechanism so in phase 0 don't expect too many people to do much
01:08:15 because in phase 0 in phase 1 then you chain negative deliberately and it doesn't have too much functionality
01:08:20 turned on it's there just like if you want to be a proof of stake validator you can get things started if you want
01:08:26 to store data for other blockchain applications you can get started but existing applications will largely keep
01:08:33 living on East one and then when the merger happens then the merger is a operation that happens all at once I
01:08:41 mean so instead of one of the benefits of I can sense a system that Nick on the one hand you have to coordinate the
01:08:46 upgrade but on the other hand the upgrade can be coordinated so what's Gasper FFG Gasper FFG is their
01:08:56 consensus algorithm that we are using for other proofs take is there something interesting specific about Casper FFG
01:09:03 like some beautiful aspect of it that's there is so in Casper FFG combines together kind of two different schools
01:09:13 of a Kuznets algorithm design so the general two different schools of the design are right one is at a 50% fault
01:09:22 tolerant but dependent on network synchrony so 50% faults are fault tolerant but it's all rate up to 50% of
01:09:30 faults but not more but it depends on an assumption that all of the nodes can talk talk to each other within some
01:09:37 development period of time like if I send the message you'll receive it within a few seconds and the second of
01:09:44 school is 33% fault tolerant but safe under a synchrony which me instead like if we agree on something then that thing
01:09:53 is finalized and even if the network goes horribly wonky the second after nothing is finalized there's no way to
01:09:57 revert that thing and that's fascinating how you would make that happen it's definitely quite
01:10:08 clever I'd recommend the Casper FFG paper if you just search like archive I said like arxiv Casper FFG it's that's
01:10:16 the papers an archive yeah yeah who are the authors myself and every Joel Griffith that's awesome I take a small
01:10:24 tangent this idea of just putting out white papers and papers and putting them on archives just putting them publicly
01:10:32 is it is that at the core is that a necessary component of cryptocurrencies that the tradition started with Satoshi
01:10:40 nakamoto's what do you make of it like what do you make of the future of that kind of sharing of ideas I guess so yeah
01:10:47 and it's definitely something that's like kind of mandatory for crypto because like crypto is all about making
01:10:55 systems where you don't have to trust the operators to trust that the thing works and so if anything behind our system
01:11:02 works is closed sourced and that kind of kills the point and so there is the kind of a sense in which the fundamental
01:11:11 properties of the category of the thing we're trying to build is just kind of forces openness but also openness just
01:11:17 has proven to be a really great way to collaborate and there's actually a lot of n of innovation and academic
01:11:23 collaboration that's just kind of happened ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years so like for example we
01:11:31 have this forum called ëthe research that's like eth our ESEA are the dots eh and there we publish and of just ideas
01:11:42 in a forum that's kind of half formal like it's halfway in between like it's it's a kind of a text write up and then
01:11:50 you can have math in it but it's the often--and of much shorter than a paper and it turns out that the great majority
01:11:58 of new ideas like they're just kind of fairly small nuggets that you can explain and like five to ten lines that
01:12:03 they don't really need the whole formality paper exactly they don't require the kind of like ten pages of an
01:12:10 ax filler and so introduction conclusion is not needed yeah and so instead you just kind of
01:12:16 published the idea and then people can go comments on it really yeah I said great for us I think I interrupted you
01:12:23 was there something else on Casper effigy that's like just Casper FFG is just kind of combines together these two
01:12:32 schools and so basically it creates this system where if you have more than 50% that are honest then the and you have
01:12:43 network synchrony then the thing kind of goes as a chain but then if network synchrony fails then kind of the last
01:12:50 few blocks in the chain might be kind to get replaced but anything that was finalized by this side of more
01:12:58 asynchronous process gets I can't be reverted and so you essentially get a kind of best of both worlds between
01:13:05 those two models okay so I know what I'm doing to them I'm currently reading the Casper effigy paper apologize for the
01:13:12 romanticized question but what do you are some or the most beautiful idea in the world of aetherium just something
01:13:22 surprising something beautiful something powerful yeah I mean I think the fact that money can just emerge out of a
01:13:29 database if enough people believe in it I think is definitely one of those things that's up there I think one of
01:13:36 the things that I really love about aetherium is also this concept of composability so this is the idea that
01:13:43 if I build an application on top of ethereum then you can build an application that talks to my application
01:13:49 and you don't even need my permission you don't even need to talk to me right so one really fun example of this as
01:13:56 there was this end of game on aetherium called that Krypto kitties the just involve head of breeding digital cats yes
01:14:03 and someone else created a game called crypto dragons where the way you play crypto dragons is you have a dragon and
01:14:11 you have to feed it crypto kitties and they just created the whole thing just like as an etherium contract that you
01:14:21 would send these these tokens that are defined by this other etherium contract for the interoperability to happen like
01:14:28 the project's didn't don't really need sir like the teams don't really need to talk to each other you just kind of
01:14:35 interface with the existing program it's just arbitrarily composable in this kind of ways you have different you know some
01:14:40 groups they could be working and so you could see it scaling to just outside of dragons and kitties it could be you
01:14:48 build like entire ecosystems of software yeah it's kind of mean especially in the decentralized finance space that's been
01:14:56 popping up in the last two years there's been a huge amount of really interesting things happen as a result of this is it
01:15:03 particularly kind of like financial applications kind of thing yeah I mean there's like stable coins so this is a
01:15:13 kind of tokens retain value I'm equal to $1 but they're kind of backed by crypt cryptocurrency then there's
01:15:21 decentralized exchanges so when as far as the decentralized exchanges go there's this really interesting
01:15:29 construction that has existed for about one one and a half years they all called yuna swap so what yuna swap is let's say
01:15:37 a smart contract that holds imbalances of two tokens will call them token a and token B and it maintains that invariants
01:15:44 that the balance of token a multiplied by the balance of token B has to equal the same value and so the way that you
01:15:51 trade against a thing is basically like you have this kind of curve you know like x times y equals K and yeah before
01:15:58 you trade it's at some points on the curve after you tre you just like pick some different any to any other points
01:16:03 on the curve and then whatever the Delta X is that's the amount of a tokens you provide whatever the Delta Y is that's
01:16:08 the amount of beads no case you get or vice versa and that's just and then and if the slope is I'm at the current
01:16:15 points on the curve and it is the price and so that just is the whole thing and that just allows you to have have this
01:16:27 exchange for tokens and even if there's very few participants and the whole thing is just like so simple and it's
01:16:35 just very easy to set up very easy to participate in and it just provides so much value to people
01:16:45 so and the the fundamental the the distributor application infrastructure allows that somehow yes so this is a
01:16:52 smart contract meeting this is all a computer program that's just running on areum smart contracts to her just
01:17:00 fascinating they are okay do you think cryptocurrency may become the main currency in the world one day so what do
01:17:08 you think we're headed in terms of the role of currency the structure type of currency in the world I definitely
01:17:17 expect fiat currencies to continue to exist and continue to be strong and I definitely expect had a fiat currency
01:17:23 stall so digitized have their own way over the next couple of decades what's fiat currency by the way so just
01:17:30 like things like US dollars like dollars and euros and Yemen these other things and they're backed by government's yes
01:17:36 but I also expect and if cryptocurrencies to play the set of important role in just making sure that
01:17:44 people always have an alternative if fiat currency start breaking so like if or if you're in you know some had a very
01:17:53 high inflation place like Venezuela for example or if you're my country just kind of gets cut off from like cut off
01:18:05 from other financial systems because of like something the banks do a gift for any kind of if there's even like some
01:18:12 major trade disruption or something worse happens then like cryptocurrencies are the sort of thing that just because
01:18:19 of their kind of global neutrality they were just and of always there and you can keep using them it's interesting
01:18:24 that you're quite humble about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency you don't think there's a
01:18:32 possible future where it becomes the main set of currency because it feels like fear it feels like the centralized
01:18:41 control by governments of currencies limiting somehow maybe my naive utopian view of the world it's a and it's
01:18:49 definitely very possible I'm I think for cryptocurrencies being the main form of value to and of work well
01:19:03 like did you need to have some much more price stability than they have today and I mean there are now stable coins and
01:19:08 there are kind of cryptic cryptocurrencies that try to be more stable than existing things like Bitcoin
01:19:16 and ether but and that just is a tsamina kind of the main challenge do you think oh that's do you think that's a
01:19:21 characteristic of this just being the early days is such young concept in ten years is nothing in the history of money
01:19:30 yeah I think it's a combination of two things right one is it's it's still early days but the other is a kind of
01:19:37 more durable any kind of economic problem which is that demand for currency is volatile right because of
01:19:46 like recessions booms changes to technology lots of things and if people's demand for how much currency
01:19:52 they want to hold changes and if you have a currency that has a fixed supply then the change in demand has to be
01:19:59 entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency and so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demand
01:20:05 becomes entirely translated into volatility and ahead of prices of things that updated in that currency but if you
01:20:13 have a currency where instead the supply can change and so the supply can even go up when there's more demands then you
01:20:20 have the supply and of absorbing more of that volatility and so the price of the currency what absorb lost some of the
01:20:26 volatility on that topic so Bitcoin does have a limited supply specific things supply yes what's what's the idea and
01:20:37 theorem doesn't but can you clarify just in the comment you just made is aetherium qualified to the kind of
01:20:42 currency that you're talking about and being flexible in the supply it's a bit more flexible but you know the thing
01:20:50 that you would really want is something that's kind of specifically flexible in a response to how valuable the currency
01:20:59 is and and I'd recommend you know what get stable coins as well so like things like dye for example
01:21:08 like baseball that Dai and whoa what's stable coins is it a type of cryptocurrency it is the type of
01:21:14 cryptocurrency it's a type of cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract one of these aetherium computer
01:21:21 programs that where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically look that people deposit and
01:21:29 then it issues diane's the reason why people deposit is because they wants to kind of go high leverage on their ether
01:21:35 and so it kind of pairs these two sets have you use there's one that wants to bility and one that kind of wants extra
01:21:41 risk together with each other and it basically creates or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll be
01:21:52 paid that they have this asset that can that can be later converted back into ether but it specifically at the end of
01:21:57 the one dollar rate and it has some kind of stabilizing network offense yeah yeah it has many kinds of stabilizing
01:22:05 mechanisms in it that's fascinating okay this is this world is awesome technically just from a
01:22:11 scientific perspective is an awesome world that I often don't see from an outsider's perspective what I often see
01:22:20 is kind of maybe hype and a little bit if I may say so like Charlton ISM and you don't often see at least for my
01:22:28 outsider's perspective the beautiful science of it and the engineering of it me maybe
01:22:35 is there a comments you can make of who to follow how to learn about this world without being interrupted by the
01:22:46 charlatans and the hyperbole in this space I think you need to just know the specific just people to follow like
01:22:54 there's you know there's all there kind of the cryptographers and the researchers and there's just like even
01:23:01 just the etherium research crew like myself st. grad Danny Justin none of the other people are and then and if the
01:23:10 academic cryptographers and I give you like before with this today I was at Stanford and Stanford has the Center for watch
01:23:19 research and of Dan Bonet this really famous and great cryptographer was never running yet and there's a lot of other
01:23:27 people there and there's people working on necks your knowledge proof so for example and Zuko from a-z caches and of
01:23:37 one other person that I get respect so I think if you follow the technicals you crawl along that yeah you just sit
01:23:44 with your in-group and then look at the academics de Beaune and so on and they just cautiously expand the network of
01:23:51 people who fall yeah exactly and like if someone seems to to self-promotional than just like remove them is there
01:24:00 books there so there's these white papers and we just discussed about about ideas being condensed into really small
01:24:07 parts is there books that are emerging that are kind of good introductory material so for a historical ones and
01:24:15 there's like Nathaniel poppers digital gold which is just about the history of Bitcoin there's like one and then
01:24:21 Matthew Ising announced that there's one about the history of aetherium for technical ones in there's injurious
01:24:28 Antonopoulos is mastering aetherium great so let me ask you sort of sorry to pull back to the the idea of governments
01:24:41 and decentralized currency you know there's a tension between the centralization of currency and the power
01:24:49 of nations the power of governments you what's your sense about that tension can is there some rule for regulation of
01:24:59 currency you yeah is there like is the government the enemy of digital currency of distributed currency or can they be
01:25:13 like cautious friends I mean I think the one thing that people forget is that it's clearly not entirely an enemy
01:25:21 because they think if there hadn't been so much government regulation on and if centralized the issuing centralized
01:25:30 digital currency is that like be seeing things with people like Google and Facebook and Twitter just kind of
01:25:35 issuing them left and right and then like if that was the case then decentralized currencies would still
01:25:40 appeal to some people but they definitely would appeal to less people than today so even in that sense I think
01:25:49 it's they clearly been more of a help just and if set the stage for the end of the existence as system of the sector in
01:26:00 some ways but but also and I think some of both you know like there's definitely things that governments and if can do in
01:26:07 some cases have done to I have hurt the spread of and of growth of a of blockchains there's things that they've done to help
01:26:17 and there in some cases definitely done a good job of and if going after fraudulent projects and they're going
01:26:23 after some of the projects that have some of their enough craziest and most misleading marketing there's also the
01:26:31 possibility that governments will end up using block chains for a lot of different things like you know
01:26:38 governments do and they do a lot more than just regulating right but there is also the they have then if identity
01:26:47 records and they have kind of like property registry is even this their own currency is like secure big lots of
01:26:55 different kind of things that they're operating and there's even blockchain applications in a lot of those and they
01:27:02 can you know they can leverage technology do a lot of good for our societies it is a little unfortunate
01:27:11 that governments often lag behind in terms of their acceptance the leverage of technology if you look at the
01:27:17 autonomous vehicle space AI in general they're they're a few years behind it'd be nice to help them catch up that's a
01:27:27 that's that's the always ongoing problem you  met Vladimir Putin to discuss the central experience a year you're born in
01:27:36 the world were you born Columbus go I mean that's vitamin potent is a is a central figure in this part of the
01:27:50 world so what was that like meeting meeting him what was that experience like he's taller and photos than in
01:28:02 person yeah that's right he's five seven I think five eight maybe yeah unfortunately we didn't actually again
01:28:10 have too much of a chance to talk to him like I managed to see him for about one minute at the end of this meeting and I
01:28:17 did get a chance to see a lot some of the other end of government ministers and he recommended some and some of them
01:28:25 are actually and if interested in trying to use blockchains to look for various government use cases the kind of a
01:28:33 little bit corruption and other things and I have like it's hard to tell from one conversation kind of what things are
01:28:40 genuine and what things are just like Oh blotchiness cool let's do blockchain right but you know when I when I listen
01:28:48 to like Barack Obama talk about artificial intelligence there's certain things I hear were okay so he might not
01:28:57 be an expert in AI but he know he like actually studied it carefully enough to think about it like he internal like
01:29:05 even if it's just reading a Wikipedia page huh like you really thought about what this technology means did you get a
01:29:13 sense that Putin or some of the ministers like thought about blockchain like thought about the fundamentals it's
01:29:19 like know like understand it intuitively or they to old school to try to grasp it some are old school some are more new school
01:29:29 it depends it's definitely depends on who you talk to I mean that's an open question for me
01:29:34 from with Putin because witness said yeah I don't know I've only talked to him for about one minute so but
01:29:39 sometimes you can pick up sort of insights there's a quick comment there there about maybe you can correct me on
01:29:46 this but they're about 3,000 cryptocurrencies being actively traded yes and aetherium is one of you know a
01:29:54 lot of people believe that there will be the the Cryptococcus i think bitcoin is
01:29:58 currently still the main cup to consoles but out there and very likely might become that the the main one is this
01:30:06 kind of diversity good in the crypto world DC is sticking around should though should there be a winner like
01:30:12 should there be some consensus globally around bitcoin or around a theory and like what's your what's your sense i
01:30:19 havent nobody think of the diversity is good and i definitely i think also that there's probably too many people trying
01:30:25 to make separate block chains so and if right now i mean the number should definitely be greater than one and
01:30:30 probably greater than two or even five not three thousand not three thousand yeah and also not even like forty
01:30:38 high-quality platforms that try to do the same thing i mean there's definitely this range from just like one person who
01:30:46 would just like wrongly thinks that you can create a cryptocurrency in like 12 hours and doesn't even think about kind
01:30:53 of the community aspects of maintaining it going to people actually trying but only creating a really tiny one - like
01:31:03 scammers to people like making something that's actually successful and then you know there's a lot of different
01:31:11 categories of blockchain then you have project in terms of what it's trying to do in what applications it's for and
01:31:17 I think the experimentation is definitely healthy if you look at the two world there might be a little bit
01:31:25 disjoints but the distributed applications cryptocurrency and in the world of artificial intelligence do you
01:31:31 see there's some overlap between these worlds that both worried about centralized control is there some
01:31:38 overlap that's interesting that you think about do you think about AI much yeah and I think definitely would have
01:31:46 thought about things like like the AI and if control problems and a lot of problems and all of those things do you
01:31:52 worry about the existential threat of AI it's definitely one of the things I worry about you think block there's a
01:32:02 lot of kind of common challenges because in in both cases when you're ultimately trying to do is you're trying to kind of
01:32:09 get a simple system to direct a more complex system like in the case of this as strong AI as
01:32:16 the idea would be that this simple system is people and the complex system is well whatever thing the people the
01:32:24 people end up and if unleashing on in the universe that'll hopefully be a great thing and in the case of vlog
01:32:31 chains and of the complex well the simple thing is the algorithm which is a piece of static and Foley open source
01:32:38 code and the more complex thing is just then all of the different possible and if human actors and if the strategy
01:32:46 is that they yet might end up be used to participate in the network mmm do you think about your own mortality like what
