00:00:01 On February 8, just one day before the start of the Olympic Winter Games in South Korea - North Korea held a military parade showing off their latest rockets.
00:00:11 And based on the timing of this, it is clear that this is meant to send a message to the outside world. Nonetheless, the country also is gaining more knowledge every year and is making rapid progress
00:00:21 in their missile development. "So between 1994 and 2007 North korea did 16 missile tests and 1 nuclear test. From January 2008 to September of 2016 they
00:00:34 did 80 missile tests and 4 nuclear tests. And at the rate they are going in 4 years of Trump they're gonna be well over 100." Even though North Korea was not part of the
00:00:54 eastern bloc and it’s collective defense treaty knows as the warsaw pact. As a socialist state, China and the Soviet Union naturally have always been it’s strongest
00:01:04 allies. In the 1950s, the North Koreans asked them for help in developing their own nuclear weapons, but both countries refused.
00:01:14 The soviets did however help the North Koreans in building their first nuclear research reactor. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the alliance became almost worthless at a stroke
00:01:27 and the North Koreans saw the threat of their country being absolutely powerless against the outside. They then used the reactor to reprocess plutonium to create nuclear weapons.
00:01:38 And they announced to leave the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty that allowed international observers to inspect the countries reactors.
00:01:47 Ever since, there have been 4 different US presidents in power and all of them tried different approaches in keeping North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
00:01:58 In Order to keep the North Koreans from leaving the Treaty on Non-Proliferation, Bill Clinton offered to in return suspend some of the military exercises done by the US army together with
00:02:08 South Korea. The North Koreans accepted to negotiate, and both countries worked out an Agreed Framework. The main ingredient of this deal was for the
00:02:15 North Koreans to shut down their Yongbon reactor. Which they officially used as an energy reactor, but was not connected to the power grid and was suspected to be used to create Plutonium.
00:02:28 According to the Framework, the reactor should be replaced by two light-water reactors and as a compensation for the theoretical loss in shutting down the Yongbon reactor, the
00:02:38 Koreans were promised 500 thousand tons of heavy fuel-oil each year. And the Clinton administration was open to accepting and recognizing North Korea in case
00:02:48 of implementation of the full framework. "The united states and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments.
00:02:58 Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the community of Nations." But Implementation of the Agreement was slow. Intelligence findings revealed that North Korea had violated the deal and started working
00:03:12 on another method of developing nuclear material through uranium enrichment. The new incoming President was opposed to the Agreement reached by his successor.
00:03:22 When George Bush became President he went for a much harder course. In his first State of the Union Adress in January 2000, he put North Korea on the Axis
00:03:31 of Evil, rendering them as an enemy of the US. "States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an Axis of Evil arming to threaten
00:03:43 the peace of the world." His administration terminated the supply of fuel-oil and the North Koreans responded by kicking out International Observers and resuming
00:03:51 their weapon programs. And they left the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, which freed them from any foreign controls on their nuclear sites.
00:04:04 The bush administration was under pressure to react and started to negotiate again with the Six-Party-Talks. Many of the things that were essential to Clintons Agreed Framework of 1994 were now
00:04:15 re-negotiated. The talks didn’t lead to results - and the US made heavy concessions in order to convince the North Koreans to stop their nuclear tests.
00:04:25 So when Barack Obama came into office he wanted to turn around that policy. His approach was quickly dubbed Strategic Patience.
00:04:34 In the hope of reducing tension, the administration waited out North Korea. Neither threatening as aggressively as Bush did, nor engaging in talks and negotiations.
00:04:43 "The fact that before I came into office you had a pattern in which North Korea would engage in some provocative action. Countries would then try to placate them by giving humanitarian aid or providing other
00:05:01 concessions or engaging in dialog." However Obamas approach didn’t stop the North Koreans from further improving their missiles.
00:05:10 And when Donald Trump came into office, the US foreign approach in dealing with North Korea was once again turned around completely. "I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position."
00:05:26 Trump wants to completely isolate North Korea and he is engaging in a sort of war or words, tweeting out threats to Kim Jong Un.
00:05:37 Because of its smallness and economic weakness - North Korea sees its nuclear program as the only way to secure lasting independence. The regime knows that despite their troop strength it’s militarily is inferior to
00:05:49 that of it’s neighbors Dr. Victor Cha, who wa the Head of the american delegation at the Six Party Talks, said that the North Koreans themself explained this
00:05:56 to him during the negotiations. "And he said this without even blinking he said: You attacked Iraq because they didn't have nuclear weapons.
00:06:08 You attacked Afghanistan because they didn't have nuclear weapons. You will never attack Iran. And you will never attack us."
00:06:16 Now North Korean testing is more than just a show for the outside. They have been able to steadily increase the range of their missiles in the last few decades.
00:06:25 It is unclear how reliable these missiles really are. While one challenge is to increase the missiles range and accuracy in hitting targets - they
00:06:33 also have to be able to withstand re-entry into the atmosphere. And they have to carry the weight and size of a nuclear warhead.
00:06:41 So there are a lot of unclear variables that make it hard to form an accurate judgement on what North Korea is currently capable of doing.
00:06:48 Yet, North Korea is already trying to change the situation with what we know they can do. "They want to decouple the Security of South Korea from the United States and Japan.
00:07:03 By being able to reach the continent of the United States the North Koreans want to instill doubt in the minds of South Koreans, Americans and Japanese that the United States and Japan
00:07:15 are not willing to risk Tokyo or Los Angeles or Chicago in order to defend Seoul." Interestingly though, while North Korea's relationship with the United States is even
00:07:29 more tense than before, North Korea and South Korea have recently come closer again. At the Olympic Winter Games in South Korea, the two countries walked in together at the
00:07:39 opening ceremony and have put together one combined Korean ice hockey team. And along the games, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un's sister met for
00:07:50 a diplomatic meeting. There she invited the President to a meeting with Kim Jong Un in North Koreas capital Pyongyang. We will have to see whether a future dialogue
00:07:57 will this time bring real disarmament and demilitarization, or whether the talks will not lead to results like in the previous attempts. It is clear though that we are in a deciding
