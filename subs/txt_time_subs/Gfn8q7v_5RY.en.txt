00:00:00 This is Los Angeles. And this part right next to us is called Hollywood. It just so happens that this is the third time we're here
00:00:06 this year, and we can attest: people from all over the world still flock to Los Angeles to make it big. First and foremost, in show
00:00:15 business. And a lot of them are Russians. The next ninety minutes will be about some of the
00:00:19 people who don't sit on their asses. You might have a good or even a great job at home, but that doesn't mean you should forget where the
00:00:27 big leagues of your craft are. We'll show you both those still working to get to the next level and someone who
00:00:36 already has. Normally, we would preface our video by telling what drove us to make it. This time, we'll echo the intro of one of
00:00:42 our fall episodes. We shot this to remind everyone that it's hard and intimidating to try new things, but trying new things
00:00:50 is vital. Let's go! While Yura is still at the customs, I'm standing here outside of the Laugh Factory.
00:01:03 [The Moscow - Los Angeles flight has landed] [Dud's been held up at the passport control] [for two hours at this point] This is one of the most iconic clubs in the US and
00:01:03 in the world. You can see the line. Every day, comedians gather here for a chance to perform at an open mic. To do that, you have to stand
00:01:13 in this line. For a guaranteed chance to perform, you have to be one of the first ten
00:01:20 people in this line. The first ten always go through and get to perform. The rest are chosen with
00:01:27 a lottery. So in total, twenty people get to perform. But the other ten are unknown — who will get
00:01:31 to perform and who won't. 'Cause there's usually 25 or 30 people in the line, or more. We arrived here at 1 PM. There were eight people
00:01:39 in the line already. I'm ninth. [Our cameramen, both Sergeis, are still at the airport] [Dud' is filming on his own]
00:01:51 [Aleksandr Nezlobin, 35, comedian] [In Russia: currently — the face of STS channel] [formerly —&nbsp;member of Comedy Club on TNT channel] [In America: nobody]
00:01:57 Wait, is Amy Schumer playing here? No, it's just a super premium advertising spot.
00:02:02 - Right... - See? She's pregnant... - ...she's wearing a ring, got married. All for the special. - Damn!
00:02:08 It's kind of ironic that people line up right under her feet, and not just feet, but other parts as well, huh?
00:02:35 That's what everyone says: "Oh, you're Russian? Privyet, idi nakhuy*." [*"Hi" and "fuck you," respectively] That's all the words they know.
00:02:40 "Babushka*," "idi nakhuy." [*"Grandma"] [Nezlobin is going to perform] [Filming inside the club is prohibited]
00:02:50 [Nikolay Stravinsky, 33, rock musician] [In Russia: ex-guitarist of the band "Tarakany*"] [In America: nobody] [*"Cockroaches"]
00:02:56 The waitress that brought us the beers... - ...she obviously had implants. - Yeah.
00:03:03 - Is it commonplace here? - Yes, very much. Have you ever... with implants?
00:03:08 I had a girlfriend with those, but this was a long time ago and not in this country. Down here, unfortunately, I'm slowly forgetting what it's like to have sex...
00:03:17 - Why? - ...unlike in Russia where I had it in spades. It's expensive. You don't know. You have to...
00:03:24 No, I don't mean hookers. If you don't want to deal with hookers, and want to have sex the good old way...
00:03:32 - Yeah? - Consensual, as it is. You need to take her somewhere,
00:03:37 spend at least, I don't know, $50 on drinks, and then think up a place for the night.
00:03:44 - I live in a tiny studio apartment... - With Dimon. - ...with Dimon, yeah. So, that's kinda the
00:03:47 gist of it. In this whole time, I had sex once. And this was about a
00:03:53 month ago. Yeah. With an American girl. Otherwise, it's been ten months
00:03:59 of celibacy. Okay, there's about 30-40 people inside [Nezlobin finished his set five minutes ago]
00:04:04 Okay, there's about 30-40 people inside [Nezlobin finished his set five minutes ago] watching people with dreams
00:04:08 of a career of the likes of Jim Carrey and Andrey Beburishvili.* [*26 y.o. rising comedy star on Russian TV] - Yes.
00:04:12 - Those guys are doing their sets in there. Sanya came out to tell his English jokes that he's told about a thousand times. - Right?
00:04:21 - I wouldn't say "thousand"... [(Top) Also in the US, but several months earlier] Jokes about stereotypes and stuff like that.
00:04:37 You said they initially laughed, but once you got to the topic of sexism, they went flat. - They stiffen up sometimes, yeah. - Yes.
00:04:42 - I can tell you why... Your impressions? Impressions? Dude, I'd been standing in this line for hours before you showed up.
00:04:51 So... I wasn't too prepared. But the impressions are alright, actually.
00:04:55 When I was here in May... This was May 8, [Nezlobin means May 8, 2018] May 9 in Russia.
00:05:00 I got inside —&nbsp;we were just visiting, as tourists, with my wife — I went to perform.
00:05:06 I stood in the line. I came beforehand. It was exhausting. I won the house spot. It's when they give you two minutes,
00:05:14 and if you win, you get four minutes. The next day, right? The next week. They do these once a week.
00:05:21 I came outside, called my wife. This was my own Victory Day*. [May 9 is celebrated in Russia as Victory Day.] This was like... I don't know. I felt like I'd won the grand
00:05:25 final of Golos talent show. I came out all emotional. I called my wife. She said: "Okay, let's stay then. Right? "Our girl doesn't go to school yet, so sure, let's stay."
00:05:35 "Okay!" Meaning, "we have a year for you to try and make it here." "If you wanna try it, it's now
00:05:41 or never." I wrote four minutes of brand new material. I thought I'd already made it. My wife and I were
00:05:47 all but selecting a house. - In Santa Monica, right? - In Santa Monica, yeah. An HBO special... I was falling asleep thinking:
00:05:53 I'd buy this, and this... - I came up, and it was four minutes of pure bomb. - ...of dead silence? Not just silence. It was bordering
00:06:03 on booing. This has been with me since childhood. We all dreamed of America. I mean I did. I don't know about
00:06:11 everybody. I didn't. Yeah. I remember being a kid holding a Master of Puppets record
00:06:20 and imagining myself here, in California, at a Metallica show or something. And then came the thought: "I either go now, or it's probably gonna be too late."
00:06:30 I just wanted to test myself. I wanted to change something. I wanted to... leave the zone where
00:06:38 [Takarany gig in Moscow] leave the zone where [Takarany gig in Moscow]
00:06:41 everything is cool and great everything is cool and great,
00:06:44 where I regularly tour, and I don't know... where I'm doing good, and go somewhere where no one's waiting for me
00:06:51 to start building myself from ground up. [Nezlobin and Stravinsky were born and grew up in Russia,] [but really want to achieve something big in the US.]
00:07:01 [This may surprise you,] [but it's not uncommon for artistic jobs.] [Fury (2014)] [Budget - $68,000,000]
00:07:12 [Suicide Squad (2016)] [Budget - $175,000,000] [Cinematography on all these films was done by] [Roman Vasyanov] [Bright (2017)]
00:07:15 [Budget - $90,000,000] [Roman Vasyanov, 38, cinematographer] [In Russia: shot Stilyagi, Piranha, Tiski] [In America: shot Suicide Squad, Fury, Bright]
00:07:26 This was 2009. Late 2009. I came here with a certain amount of money. How much?
00:07:35 $20,000. I had $20,000. I realized that if I don't start shooting in, like... three or four months,
00:07:44 then I have to decide to either go back, and if I do, I either fly back and forth,
00:07:51 or I borrow more money and sit tight. I brought my family with me,
00:07:56 simply because I realized that, you know, we either do this together or the family itself becomes
00:08:06 an uncertainty. Yeah. And my wife, she is this fearless person, I am eternally grateful to her
00:08:10 for that. She agreed, and we went together into this uncertainty with two kids: our son is four, our daughter is
00:08:15 8 months old. We rented an apartment. I took out a loan with the help of a friend who vouched for me that I wouldn't just bail.
00:08:26 One morning, we woke up as citizens of Los Angeles. I remember one day, we went to the store to buy groceries.
00:08:33 I can picture the front of the store right now. We gathered a bunch of stuff like we're used to and headed for the checkout.
00:08:40 They're scanning our groceries, and I watch the total go... At this point, I realize:
00:08:50 like, I can't spend $400 on groceries. I mean, I don't have this kind of money.
00:08:56 But there's a line of Americans behind us, and I go, "Masha, we can't. We gotta cancel."
00:09:02 She looks at me, and it's so surreal: you got two kids, you got four people worth of groceries over here
00:09:07 and a line of people behind you who just wanna buy something and leave, but you realize that you physically can't pull out the card and pay
00:09:13 this kind of money for food, 'cause it just won't go down later on. I curb myself and go: "Sorry. Excuse us. I'm sorry."
00:09:21 And we start taking the food back. And I can tell that everyone in the store is in shock.
00:09:26 We come out and get into our rented car, and a buyer runs up to us.
00:09:31 A salesman rather, sorry. And he says, "Why didn't you buy the groceries?" I go, "I'm sorry."
00:09:37 "Our prices are the same as Whole Foods' across the street!" Whole Foods is the Americans' go-to place for food. It's super.
00:09:44 I realize that this is a problem. So I start calling friends, asking: where do people down here get food, like, for a week?
00:09:51 Someone finally told me about a store where it all cost $180 or $150. After you saw the $400 total, $150 is like: "Okay! $150! That's probably a fair price!"
00:10:01 And you're already hip to local pricing. But overall, at first, we were positively stunned.
00:10:09 But we eventually got over it. [Here's another person] [who doesn't just sit on their ass]
00:10:15 I want to tell you about another person who doesn't sit on their ass. You know my boy Zheka Savin.
00:10:21 A year ago, he had every opportunity to remain on TV and be a excellent, exciting, and sought-after caster and host.
00:10:28 But to him, it wasn't enough, so he launched a YouTube blog, which, as of spring of 2019, has become the #1 sports outlet in Russia. Zheka has a birthday in mid-April.
00:10:41 He does all his filming with an action camera. He travels all over
00:10:47 and some shots would become even better if done from a drone. That drone is what I plan to give him.
00:10:53 You could ask, "Yura, why would you publicly reveal your gift? "You'll spoil the surprise!" Zheka NEVER watches vDud'.
00:11:01 This doesn't affect our friendship and will even help me out today.
00:11:05 Before going to an online store for our drone, we will pick the perfect model on e-Katalog.
00:11:11 Okay... Full HD, Ultra HD... 49 models, let's check 'em.
00:11:16 Damn, they're beauties. We narrowed it down to 49. That's pretty good. But not low enough for my brain. Let's come up
00:11:20 with more filters. Let's also check "Follow me" and "Circling a spot." It will film on its own and free
00:11:27 Dzhekson's hands. Because Zheka travels alone with a backpack, it would be great it fit in that purse of his. But... Score!
00:11:36 Nine models. You know, I don't think I even give my wife birthday presents that cost this much. Zheka, I hope you deliver and
00:11:43 use it properly. To expose mansions and all the corrupt figures of Russian soccer, and everything they built on people's
00:11:51 money, and the stuff they appropriated! In short, Zheka: who else if not you?
00:11:57 And... send them to Compare. I suggest this one.
00:12:01 What's "zoom?" To enlarge? Wait! So if someone's sunbathing behind the fence, you can... you know? Yep!
00:12:08 Let's take this one. "Personal card." If you too need to quickly find a gift for someone close,
00:12:14 follow the link in the description and pick one on e-Katalog. As a bonus, you can grab a gift for yourself.
00:12:21 From April 4 to 19, e-Katalog is hosting a raffle. To register for it you need to:
00:12:28 register on e-katalog.ru or ek.ua; pick one or several products from the Gadgets category
00:12:37 with the total Budget of up to $2,000 and add them to your wishlist; share your wishlist on facebook or on vk
00:12:45 and put one of the hashtags in the post; leave a link to your OPEN social media account on the raffle page.
00:12:53 The winner will get everything on their wishlist, courtesy of e-Katalog. The winner will be picked on April 19, at 12:00 PM MSK
00:13:02 with the help of random.org and announced on the raffle page. Let's go!
00:13:07 $2,000 is a good bit of change, isn't it? Go! Happy birthday, Dzhekson! [Zheka, don't stop!]
00:13:19 You've told the story of your rise a thousand times. - Because I respect you, I'm not going to... - Thanks!
00:13:26 I won't make you tell this story in detail. Let's do it briefly, as is custom on sports.ru, with bullet points.
00:13:34 - "Bullet points!" - Briefly. You had a next door neighbor who worked as a cinematographer.
00:13:39 My father knew him, yeah. They lived above us. He suggested you apply to VGIK*. [*Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]
00:13:44 - Yep. - You did. You were shocked to find out how clueless you were compared to other students.
00:13:49 - You fell in love with the craft, started learning... - Yes. Plus, you got lucky, because you were covering tuition yourself,
00:13:56 then you ran out of money, but someone skipped class... Yeah, he got the boot, I got his state-funded spot.
00:14:00 That's how you got into the world of cinema. The States happened after the Philips commercial.
00:14:06 A couple of things happened at once. The Philips video I shot got the Film Craft Grand Prix in Cannes.
00:14:14 The commercial. At the same time, the film Stilyagi was shown at the Toronto Film Festival. When people called me, they actually thought those
00:14:20 were works by two different people. When my agent called me, he thought the ad was shot by a young guy, and the film Stilyagi —&nbsp;by someone
00:14:29 who's sixty-ish, 'cause it's huge and it's a musical. In America, you can't imagine a 26-year-old shooting
00:14:33 something like Stilyagi. Like, it's physically impossible. Why? Wrong genre or
00:14:40 something? No, because to them, it's an enormous movie. Like, roughly, if in Russia something Budgets
00:14:45 $6, 7 or 8 million to shoot, in America, it would've Budget $70 million. Of production value.
00:14:55 In America, if a movie has a budget of $70 million, then there's absolutely zero chance it's gonna be shot by a 27 years old.
00:15:02 Even if he's a genius of art cinema. Simply because there are producers,
00:15:08 there's an insurance company... In other words, you have to be an experienced cinematographer.
00:15:13 Responsibility's too big. Responsibility's too big, of course. Every day of shooting Budgets, like, $1 million. And if you mess something up — plus back then,
00:15:18 we were using film, so it was kind of like a strategic stance in a sense. The idea is the same as with
00:15:27 soccer, right? Somewhere in Argentina, Uruguay, or Poland a talented player emerges, and he's immediately in
00:15:34 the crosshairs of major teams. Basically, yes. There are five or six gigantic agencies operating in the US
00:15:44 who represent actors, cinematographers, directors, production designers, editors... And there's this ongoing
00:15:53 festival-wide and now Internet-wide search. They're constantly looking for talents.
00:16:00 And their approach is honestly brilliant. They bring the person in, knowing that they're hungry and that they're gonna go to the top.
00:16:07 And they can make a lot of money off of him, plus, the guy gets to make it big. And this system works. I wondered whether creative agencies or talent agencies were possible in Russia.
00:16:19 Like a conglomerate of sorts. 'Cause they actually possess enormous...
00:16:25 power, let's say, in Hollywood. I realized it was impossible in Russia,
00:16:31 simply because we have completely different approaches to the word "talent." What do you mean?
00:16:38 Here, film production is often terrifying in terms of valuing human lives and human resources.
00:16:48 People sometimes work for, like... don't get paid overtime, work extra hours for years
00:16:55 with a single day off, and so on. And everyone thinks it's fine.
00:17:00 In the West, in all civilized countries and particularly in America, when it comes to agencies and agents,
00:17:07 these people don't just fight for your salaries, monitor your income, and so on. They first and foremost protect your rights as a talent.
00:17:15 Meaning, if you work, like, over 15 hours, they'll make sure you get paid overtime. There has to be at least a 12-hour break between shifts so you could SLEEP,
00:17:24 so you'd come in the next day well-rested, rather than after three hours of sleep. 'Cause in Russia, some people think it's okay to wrap up at 2 AM and be back on the set at 7 AM.
00:17:33 So I mean... - It affects your work. - Of course! I actually think that this idea of
00:17:37 "the worse the better" is super outdated. I mean this idea that "a tougher set makes a better film" is outdated.
00:17:48 'Cause it's about people not having a general idea of what they're trying to shoot; it's about unpreparedness and about not having done your homework.
00:17:56 I was stunned when I was shooting my first film in America. I got my call sheet. It said: 8 AM - shift start.
00:18:03 I thought: "Okay, 8 AM. I'll set the lighting, wait till the actors show up. "We'll probably start shooting around 10:30." On the first day, I arrived
00:18:09 at 7:45, thinking, "Hey, I even showed up 15 minutes early!" And I see the whole crew is already
00:18:14 finishing breakfast, people are on the set, people are busy. I'm thinking, "Okay, that's probably
00:18:22 procedure." I get behind the camera, thinking, "So I'll put the lights here and here..." Then bam! — 8 AM, they bring out
00:18:29 Emile Hirsch, the actor. I realize I'm not just unprepared — [Alpha Dog, Milk, Savages]
00:18:35 I'm completely unprepared. And at that point, they go, "You all set? We ready to shoot? Roma, you all set?"
00:18:44 And me, I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Like, it's your first project. You're shaking.
00:18:52 Everyone speaks English. Not a word in Russian. I said: "Yes! I need ten minutes."
00:18:58 Like, I need ten minutes. They go: "Ten minutes? Okay." You leave and everyone's like: "Hm, what's wrong with this guy? Is he okay?"
00:19:06 "Who else is available? Should we make a couple of calls?" And your brain starts to work like a scalpel.
00:19:12 You pick up a bulb and put it in the perfect spot where it has to go. And you're like, one, two, three. "Okay, all set!"
00:19:18 And they go:,"Oh yeah, he probably changed his mind on something." They don't think, "He's unprepared."
00:19:23 No. "He got a different artistic idea. A better one." You go, "Yeah, yeah." And then... And then you start shooting.
00:19:29 I remember the next day, I arrived at 6:45 though the shift started at 8:00. At that point, I realized: well yeah, breakfast from 6:45 to 7:15,
00:19:37 then you go on set and give the gaffer not just a lighting layout, [Gaffer is another name for chief lighting technician] then you go on set and give the gaffer not just
00:19:41 a lighting layout, [Gaffer is another name for chief lighting technician] but rather particular, like, definite...
00:19:46 but rather particular, like, definitive... exact spots where equipment should stand.
00:19:50 You have to have done your homework: where the actors go, how you light them, how you adapt if blocking changes —
00:19:57 that's scene staging, where they're gonna stand — what you gonna do then. So realistically, I think there's no greater school of cinematography in terms of
00:20:06 mastery — it's hand crafting, like, it is a craft, and it's a wonderful word, there's nothing insulting about it, it's very accurate — in terms
00:20:13 of craft, than what they have in America, in Hollywood, anywhere in the world. I shot all over the place. And I think theirs is
00:20:18 the highest caliber. When you're good at it, when you've mastered it, it feels awesome. At that point you think: "Should I try to direct something? Just outta curiosity. Then to back."
00:20:31 [Vasyanov currently shoots in Russia as a director] [He is currently adapting A. Ivanov's Dorm on Blood] Like, you realize you possess certain knowledge that in the end
00:20:35 will stay with you forever. It's a vocation. You can make amazing shoes that will always be in high demand. In a sense.
00:20:47 This is a hostel. Wait, don't you live alone? No, right now I live with my...
00:20:51 I used to live in the room next door. [Nezlobin doesn't reside in the US] [He only flies in to perform] I had my wife fly over to support me,
00:20:53 what a boss. [Nezlobin doesn't reside in the US] [He only flies in to perform] Russian. Just like you
00:20:56 like it. This is where my DP sleeps. [Nezlobin is making a film about his adventures]
00:21:01 [in America, so he brings a cinematographer] He says, "Sanya, we can switch beds if you want." He's Latvian. Look.
00:21:05 He's reading about Brezhnev. He's also got magazines about the SS.
00:21:10 No comment about what's going on in Latvia. Russia and Latvia are friends. This is where I sleep. This is my wardrobe.
00:21:16 I didn't expect you to come in, so I... tidied up. Why a hostel though?
00:21:22 Because this place is within walking distance of three of America's biggest clubs
00:21:29 that deal with comedy. I could stay at Roosevelt Hotel. But I'd rather pay off my mortgage loan sooner and buy
00:21:34 a second camera to shoot the film. - Rooms here are about $150, right? - $120. I learned yesterday. You wanna know the
00:21:42 best part? The total Budget of equipment in this rooms could buy you half of this
00:21:48 building. It was my wife who picked the hotel. I'm the spender in the family. [This is breakfast in Nezlobin's hostel]
00:21:55 I showed her apartments on Airbnb and the Roosevelt Hotel. She said something cool.
00:22:01 She said, "If it's possible, "I'd rather we paid off a portion of the loan and you canceled some the your work, "so we could spend more time
00:22:08 together." I want you to tell us in this setting where the apartment that you took out the
00:22:13 loan for is located. - The loan one? - Yes. What part of Moscow is
00:22:20 it in? Oh. In Patriarch's Ponds. Yep. A guy from Patriks* came here to live in a hostel.
00:22:23 [*P. Ponds is a very affluent residential area] But I wouldn't have been able to buy that apartment if I didn't live in hostels like this one. I would've slowly spent
00:22:32 it all. Plus, I didn't *buy* it. You know how much I owe? You know what the funniest
00:22:36 part is? Sberbank told me to test for HIV. Not cancer. HIV, dude.
00:22:43 - So you don't die too soon? - ...to give me the loan. Yes. But HIV! I thought, "Why not cancer?"
00:22:49 Then I realized. They're telling you frankly that for the next twenty years, we're gonna fuck you, dude.
00:22:55 We need you to be healthy. To clarify, this is the sickest place in Moscow.
00:23:00 I didn't know that. Vladimir Pozner lives in Ponds. In their golden times, Mikhail Shatz and Tatiana Lazareva
00:23:03 got a big apartment there. STS channel! 33 million rubles*. [*~$508,000 in May of 2019]
00:23:10 - Got it. - Will you add the ka-ching sound here? We will.
00:23:13 For the first two weeks, we'd wake up in our new apartment, I'd go, "Sweetheart, can you believe this place?"
00:23:20 She said, "I can't." We are people who enjoy. Prior to that, the three of us spent a
00:23:24 year at a place measuring 34 m², where you'd wake up — and there's the bathroom. My wife would go: "We'll manage.
00:23:32 We're fine. It's fine." Now, we wake up... Dude, for the first two days, we'd go: "You have to WALK to the bathroom?!" We'd walk there. My legs would
00:23:40 get tired. I live without an elevator, specifically for you. To lose weight. Dude, we get so much pleasure
00:23:46 out of it. We are people who appreciate. Some people have billions and a bunch
00:23:51 of property. To me, this is a golden anchor that I've dropped in Moscow. And we thank fate for giving us this
00:23:59 opportunity. But at the same time, we figure: fuck, we deserve this! Like, I earned it.
00:24:07 So I think: why should I feel embarrassed about it? - Who says you should? - No, no, but I have it inside me.
00:24:14 Embarrassment? Yeah, it's like a Soviet atavism: what will people say? And it stops me from getting
00:24:17 somewhere here. People don't have it here? Here, you're supposed to say:
00:24:22 "I'm awesome!" And I can't. I go, like, "I might say something funny tonight." These days, I don't do that
00:24:30 anymore. I'm learning to... My wife actually helped me get my self-esteem up. Fun fact about coffee and tea in airports
00:24:37 and on planes is that they don't wash those kettles. 'Cause it's impossible to wash that coffee off,
00:24:43 and they constantly use them. So in China, previously used good quality kettles Budget more. - Those that were used to make tea.
00:24:52 - Why? 'Cause there's tea residue on walls, and you get better brews. This Regular Coffee here is like that too.
00:24:59 They never wash it. They make coffee, and caffeine accumulates over the course of years. Wait, can I open it to look
00:25:07 inside? Sure you can. A guy with eczema did. Why can't you?
00:25:25 [Selfieman is Stravinsky's project] [that he intends to conquer America with] Show us the digs.
00:25:37 It's like I'm stuck in the middle of a tour, in some hotel near Saratov;
00:25:41 stuck in this single hotel room. It's a single room. No antechamber, no kitchen, nothing. Bathroom, shower, and that's it.
00:25:49 - Is this your bed? - It's Diman's. - He's bigger in terms of... - Size?
00:25:51 - Yeah. Right. Diman is your friend who came here with you. Yeah. We've been friends since
00:25:58 childhood. We've known each other since 1994. We went to choreography school together
00:26:03 for years. And he was even the bassist in my very first band. - Oh! He's from Ulyanovsk too.
00:26:08 - Yes. - Is this the kitchen? - This is the kitchen, yeah. I never used a stove in my life.
00:26:13 Never cooked. In all my years renting places, I probably... - ...made pelmeni once every 3 years. Not my forte.
00:26:20 - It caught up to you here, huh. - It caught up to me, yeah. - Why? Well, caught up how? I still don't know
00:26:26 how to cook. If, say, in Russia I could go to16 Tons for lunch every day, [16 Tons is a club and restaurant in the center of Moscow]
00:26:34 here, I can't afford this kind of luxury. [16 Tons is a club and restaurant in the center of Moscow] So I have to cook something myself.
00:26:38 So I have to cook myself. Because supermarket prices here are about the same
00:26:43 as prices at chow places back home. How much do you pay for this place?
00:26:49 Well, with all the bills, just under $1300 a month. Woah, room with a view!
00:26:56 Basically, yeah. If you open the blinds, you can't really do anything here.
00:27:03 Though what could you do here that you couldn't show? Misfits curtains?
00:27:08 Yeah, it's a gift from a local friend. Unfortunately, it's a few inches too long.
00:27:14 So when people complain about their bad apartment but they have a bath... What wouldn't I give for a bath!
00:27:22 I'd give half of my life to just lie in warm water. I really miss that. One of your sources of income
00:27:29 is writing music for clients in Russia. In terms of movies, it's all local folks.
00:27:35 In terms of arrangements, [Stravinsky writes scores for short films] [for Californian film school students] [In such projects, the composer]
00:27:37 [makes on average $500-700] yeah, there are a few guys that I work with; they send me a guitar song and I build them an arrangement.
00:27:47 Can you explain building an arrangement? In 30 seconds. For complete dummies.
00:27:51 Someone is playing the guitar and singing a song, using three or four of the most common chords.
00:27:58 And I build it into something that sounds... the way a song is supposed to sound.
00:28:19 They overlapped. Yeah, you can make them... So it's like there're two guitarists
00:28:22 in the band. You can record an entire orchestra this way. Which is what I do. Do you live in your own
00:28:28 place in LA? Yes. So you bought the apartment?
00:28:34 Well, yeah. Are you aware that very few people in LA do that? Since I'm completely clueless when it
00:28:39 comes to investment and I don't have a lot of money, I believe that real estate is the only thing
00:28:45 worth investing in. Actually, I have this associate... a person who does my
00:28:54 bookkeeping. 'Cause it's really complex in the US. He's like a SP's accountant in Russia. And he said something wise: "Buy real estate.
00:29:00 It's all the land we'll get." Like, there's planet Earth. And it's all there is. It's not getting bigger.
00:29:09 You can buy land or a house, and your chunk will not shrink. I think that's genius.
00:29:14 Even though the value could grow slowly or not grow at all, or whatever. I think it's still a sort of an old school way of parking your cash.
00:29:23 I believe that... Plus, I prefer living at my own place. I've had my fill of rented apartments in America. With kids and so on.
00:29:33 So I was very happy when I got the opportunity to buy a place. Did your friend come to make it big in the US too?
00:29:41 I think his goals are slightly different. He just decided to radically change his life
00:29:46 and get a degree in filmmaking. Writing scripts, shooting, and so on.
00:29:52 So he attends a film school. Yes. Los Angeles City College.
00:29:56 Mark Hamill is one of their alumni. He's the Jedi, Luke Skywalker. Who else do they have? They have some special dude.
00:30:05 Yes, they have a special dude. He's American and he's from California,
00:30:10 which is very important, because he's a hobo
00:30:14 and he studies there for free. So. He comes to lectures with a suitcase.
00:30:20 He listens to them, watches, maybe does some sort of home work, then gets off college grounds and goes to sleep on a sidewalk.
00:30:30 So. Literally?! Quite literally.
00:30:34 Like: that's it, I'm home. Okay. But doesn't he smell in class? Somehow, someway,
00:30:38 he doesn't. I'm not exaggerating. I was dumbfounded myself, but... I mean it looks so
00:30:43 weird. Hobos want to socialize. But there's more.
00:30:53 Walking around Hollywood, this would get me every time: you walk past someone's tent, and they have an
00:30:57 AC in there. And it looks so weird. - An AC inside the tent?
00:31:05 - An AC in the tent, yes. He's hot. He's hot, so he has an AC. That's it. He's got a power cable running
00:31:11 from somewhere. Dude, they sit around with iPhones, they've music playing. They're loving life.
00:31:19 - Because they get $800 of aid a month. - Yep. Why not? Why would you pay rent for a tiny room like this,
00:31:29 when you can enjoy life under the sky. And if you're cold, you have the AC.
00:31:35 They live the dream. So you moved and just waited. Yes, I moved and waited. And went
00:31:44 to interviews. They start sending you scripts. You go, "I like this one."
00:31:50 I'd take every script they offered me. And basically, chance brought me to director David Ayer,
00:31:55 who was looking for a way to shoot a cop film, End of Watch, on a GoPro. This was my second interview.
00:32:01 He invited me. We sat down, started talking. He goes, "You're Russian?" 'Cause the thing is, he used to serve on a nuclear submarine.
00:32:10 He said: "I've visited Russia. I won't tell you where though." I go, "I get it." Meaning... He probably surfaced somewhere in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.
00:32:18 So we talked. I told him about myself. He said, "Okay." And he left.
00:32:24 I got a call. I needed to go shoot an ad for MTS in Odessa. I told my wife: "I'm gonna fly coach there and back. Make us some money."
00:32:31 So I went to Odessa for two weeks. I shot the ad. They called me while I was in Odessa and told me:
00:32:36 "This director wants to shoot with you. David. You met him." So I got back from Odessa right into pre-production.
00:32:43 So it took me —&nbsp;what? — about a month before I got my first project in America.
00:32:52 But if you didn't, the $20,000 would've turned into a zero and... They would've run out and I would've told my wife: "Well, it's been fun. Oh well."
00:32:59 We'd've gotten into a car and gone home. How would you explain why you left?
00:33:04 Being in such high demand in Russia. If have this feeling, which I partly hate about myself,
00:33:11 because it stops me from being able to enjoy what I have in life. Say I worked hard, and I made some money or achieved something,
00:33:19 and it's time to breathe out and enjoy it. But I wake up the next morning in a cold sweat, thinking:
00:33:24 "My life is awful. It's not in order. I'm not growing. I'm becoming an idiot." I don't want these thoughts, but I can't get rid of them.
00:33:33 Moving here was the same deal. I'd wake up in Russia, thinking: "I need to do something soon! Maybe film this or that."
00:33:41 It's an intuition. It's a subconscious thing that I can't explain. When I answered the phone, I knew I needed to buy a ticket and leave.
00:33:49 I didn't question it. I was even scheduled to shoot a film in Russia. It was in pre-production. It was being produced by
00:33:56 Sergey Selyanov. [Sergey Selyanov produced] [Brother, Brother 2, Arrhythmia, Salyut 7 and others] I called Sergey, I said: "I'm sorry. I have these
00:33:58 circumstances. [Sergey Selyanov produced] [Brother, Brother 2, Arrhythmia, Salyut 7 and others] "I was invited to America. I have to leave.
00:34:02 I won't be able to shoot." "I was invited to America. I have to leave. I won't be able to shoot." Besides, this was seven or eight weeks
00:34:05 before shooting. Which made it a pretty nasty thing to do to someone. - A bit of a flake out.
00:34:13 - A flake out, yeah. I apologized. And he knew me, we had worked together. He knew I wouldn't do
00:34:18 that unless I felt I had to go for it 100%. If you stayed in Russia and continued shooting films
00:34:24 like Piranha and Stilyagi, big, influential films, would you have made more
00:34:36 or less than in your early years in Hollywood? More... in Russia, of course.
00:34:43 Because in America, you pay steep taxes. - 39%? - 42%.
00:34:49 - Forty-two percent. - Yes. While in Russia, if you work as a SP, it's 7%, right?
00:34:54 Yes, 7%. In addition to taxes, the agency takes 10%. So you basically give
00:34:58 up 52%. What about the pay itself for working on a top Russian film and a top American film? It's a lot greater in America, of course, but if you account
00:35:07 for agency fees and taxes, you basically get identical figures. Even for me right now. - Even now?
00:35:18 - Even now. However, there's this thing in America where you can deduct taxes from equipment that you buy
00:35:25 and so on, and so forth. So there's a safety net. But overall, net figures are not wildly different.
00:35:36 They're wildly different if you won an Oscar for cinematography in the past and if you're a straight up guru,
00:35:43 then the difference is probably big. But at this average, alright...
00:35:48 not even average, but let's say at above average, alright level, the salaries of top specialists are quite comparable.
00:35:58 I don't know about now, but at least when I was leaving, they were. Can you remind us how much your show Budgets these days?
00:36:05 600,000 rubles per show. Or 650,000. It depends. Office party? Depends on complexity,
00:36:13 and on... how I feel at the time. I try to avoid doing office parties, 'cause they make
00:36:19 me feel not right inside. I sometimes just name a ridiculous figure, so that, if they agree, at least I know exactly
00:36:27 why I'm doing it. How ridiculous? - Can be 1.5 million. - 1.5?
00:36:34 - Can be more. - Then why... If you're still in high demand in Russia
00:36:41 and you can still convert your recognizability into decent dough, why are you doing this?
00:36:47 Why stand in lines to open mics? Why pursue these clubs that,
00:36:53 despite being holy and legendary, look... - They look pretty bad. - They look like shit.
00:36:57 - Yeah. - Why do you need all this? I don't know, Yura. A couple of times I...
00:37:02 I once stood in that line and thought to myself: "What is the point of this? Why am I doing it?"
00:37:10 But I can't not do it. I have several answers.
00:37:16 In short, first of all, it's like a game to me. It's like I'm in GTA. First couple of weeks, I'd walk outside... There's a local
00:37:21 crazy person talking to himself. You visit places. After all, this is filmmaking heaven from childhood. So I sort of play this
00:37:30 thing. Second... Ambitions, of course. You want to...
00:37:38 Well, first of all, they made stand-up comedy... Like, it emerged in Britain, but it's here that they turned it into an industry.
00:37:47 And when you do something, it's like in sports, you want to get into the pro league. Coming up here... It's also a way to learn the language. That's another answer.
00:37:57 But coming on stage here and realizing that you're funny to a completely different audience, one that thinks differently and speaks a different language, it has an internal
00:38:07 payoff. What's my goal? I won't rest until... I wanna do something internationally
00:38:11 in my life. I want to keep growing and getting better as a producer and as
00:38:16 a performer. And it would be cool to... And the money! You love
00:38:22 money, right? This industry has money in it. It would be cool to get multimillion-dollar
00:38:27 paycheck for a single show. Though that's not as important to me. And my last big answer is that it's
00:38:35 a hobby. Some people collect butterflies. My hobby is conquering
00:38:40 America. Kinda. What can an earn you a multimillion- dollar paycheck?
00:38:47 A special. A comedy special. Translate. What's a special?
00:38:51 It's a show. It's approximately forty to sixty minutes of your material that you... It's your show shot on camera, about an hour of your jokes,
00:39:03 that you sell to your Netflix, or Amazon, or HBO, or whatever. - They pay you a couple of million dollars for it... - Yes.
00:39:10 and then sell it through their platform — as producers of creative content.
00:39:15 Yes, they buy your material. Well, from some people, they buy shows for $100,000.
00:39:19 Dave Chapelle has recently sold three specials for $45 million. Wat. He sold three specials, three hours of material, for $45 million.
00:39:31 - To Netflix? - Yes. But he's a legend, Yura.
00:39:34 [Other sources say Chapelle was paid $60 million] But he's a legend, Yura. [Other sources say Chapelle was paid $60 million]
00:39:35 He's a legend. He... [Other sources say Chapelle was paid $60 million] - Can they possibly return their money? - He retired, by the way.
00:39:39 No, they can't. It's about growing the client base. He retired. He left television when they
00:39:43 tried to collar him — he had a very successful show — and moved somewhere in Central America,
00:39:52 bought a ranch and lived there. He returned. They asked him, "Why did you return?" He said, "Money."
00:39:57 He returned, grabbed his basket of money, and went back to grow corn. But he's amazing. He really is.
00:40:05 What was your plan? The plan was as follows. I planned that
00:40:10 when I come here, I'll do as many shows as possible and, as it usually happens,
00:40:19 study the local scene. When I arrived here, I learned that it's not that easy to
00:40:24 play here. In the sense that there's a metric fuckton of musicians
00:40:30 here. There's like five bands per show with fifteen people in the room. [Stravinsky playing in LA]
00:40:41 This is typical for LA. [Stravinsky playing in LA] This blew my mind.
00:40:45 [Stravinsky playing in LA] Plus, every promoter wants a pre-sale. Which was normal in Moscow in, like, 2007.
00:40:52 What's pre-sale? Pre-sale means sold tickets. You have to guarantee that you'll sell at least, say, 20 tickets. You normally buy them
00:40:57 yourself. Obviously. I just came here. Nobody knows me yet. And obviously, there's no talk of getting
00:41:02 paid to play. You're the one paying. And these tickets... They're not Russian tickets. They're at
00:41:10 least $10 or so. So you have to pay at least $200 for the honor of playing, and bringing the stage,
00:41:17 and... - All the equipment. - Yeah, all the equipment. Everything. After doing several shows
00:41:22 like that, I realized I had to radically change my plan. Which I'm currently
00:41:28 doing. I'm trying to come up with the most kickass album. I'm recording it.
00:41:39 Trying to make it less academic. 'Cause Selfieman is fairly complex music
00:41:45 for the listener, I can see that. Trying to make it faster and not too lyrical,
00:42:08 because people come to shows to relax, dance, and hop around. And basically, trying to come up with a very strong idea for a video
00:42:19 and then promote it with all I've got. Oh, by the way! You said they do karaoke nights on Wednesday. On Mondays, they do
00:42:27 comedy bbq. There you go. What does that mean?
00:42:31 It means students eat bbq and whoever wants can do their comedy. Does anyone here NOT want to be a comedian?
00:42:41 I don't know. Probably no. Down here... We'll go to the club. When you see this crowd of comedians outside,
00:42:50 it's like the air is filled with the smell of ruined lives. Because these people...
00:42:56 They return again and again. They work nine to five to make ends meet, then they go to this open mic, and it's painful.
00:43:03 I went to bed at 12:30 AM last night. Well, got home, because it's a waiting game.
00:43:10 You wait and you wait, and you don't know if they'll call you. And it grounds you real hard and hits you square in the head.
00:43:17 So the industry actually has a clever method to it. I think people here don't get lightheaded from getting super rich overnight,
00:43:25 because it never happens. There's a long road to travel, and they humiliate you all the way.
00:43:31 Same happened to me. I used to stand near the stairs. It's a three-hour shoot. You keep hearing: "Yeah, yeah, we'll put you in." And then they wrap.
00:43:37 - In Comedy Club? - Yes. You go take off the mic, remove the makeup. Not everyone likes LA.
00:43:43 And some say that an atmosphere of ruined lives hangs in the air here. Right? As a citizen of LA, do you notice that?
00:43:54 I think it's mostly about actors. 'Cause people have this kind of dream.
00:44:00 Like, honestly, there certainly are people like that, but after you talk to them for three minutes, you realize
00:44:05 why that happened. Like, it's not that fate was unfair to them. In most cases, at the time of making
00:44:11 their decision, they hadn't thought things through properly, let's say. - They overestimated themselves.
00:44:18 - They overestimated their ability. More so, it's usually people without a precise goal. Like, for example...
00:44:28 They don't go: "I want to come to LA and be the best at reeling cables." Those people do start reeling cables,
00:44:37 and things happen naturally in their lives. These people go: "I wanna come to LA and succeed."
00:44:42 Full stop. Succeed... in what? "In getting fame and money."
00:44:47 Okay, but this isn't a... I think that's technically impossible, because it's not a goal. I think the goal has to be very
00:44:53 specific. Then there's a chance to reach it. But if your goal is this wishy-washy,
00:45:01 that's harder. What you're saying is great. But there was this comment with the most likes
00:45:07 under your teaser, I think, on your YouTube channel. You're making a film about you
00:45:15 conquering the US, and you uploaded a teaser. Do you think we'll show the US who's
00:45:20 fucking boss? We have every chance to show them who's fucking boss. And one particular comment caught my eye and
00:45:26 expressed my thoughts as well: "Show who's 'fucking boss' in Russia first. "Then go to the US."
00:45:37 Yeah. Okay. Your question? What do you say to that?
00:45:41 Don't you find this comment extremely reasonable? Well, yeah, but you see, the thing about Russia is that,
00:45:51 I think, the peak of what you can do in comedy is, I don't know, becoming #1 comedian in Russia.
00:45:59 But that's impossible, because it's an ongoing race. Someone gets in the
00:46:05 lead; another person gets pushed back because it's been a year since their last special; third, fourth... So there's
00:46:11 kind of a... Nobody goes: "This guy is #1. "We're the judges. We picked him. He won.
00:46:15 He's the best." Right? We don't have that. So what's the ceiling? Hosting your own late night show?
00:46:22 We have Vanya Urgant. I think he's the best comedian in Russia right now. It's not fun to just keep
00:46:29 this up. I mean, I still do shows in Russia and tell jokes in Russian. But I also want to expand and tell jokes
00:46:37 in English too. I think you can grow this way and this way as well. How do I proceed?
00:46:48 I continue doing shows in Russia, and I try do improve my comedy there.
00:46:54 What stops me from growing in both places? Why should I stop myself from performing in English if I want to?
00:47:01 Because of a comment written by someone who watched me on the TV as a kid and liked me,
00:47:07 but then went: "I have my own opinion!" - Okay, imagine then that I wrote that comment. - Sure.
00:47:15 What do I know about Sashka Nezlobin? Sashka Nezlobin is one noteworthy Russian comedians,
00:47:21 not the best one, but who's occasionally funny, who made several films and shows
00:47:29 of questionable quality... - We'll get back to them. - Not all of them. Now, he suddenly goes to
00:47:33 America. Why him, rather than someone who's better regarded? Anyone can go.
00:47:41 This isn't a Soviet competition to get into summer camp. "This is Union-wide tryouts to decide who will go!"
00:47:48 Because he fucking wants to go. He can go, so he does. When it's all in order on the family front...
00:47:56 I have a rule: my family has to feel good and comfortable. Right?
00:48:01 Second: my job on STS, I mean at STS Media, is secure,
00:48:08 then I have me-space or me-time. I can go on a fishing trip or to a hookah bar.
00:48:14 I go to LA to stand in line. I fucking earned this right.
00:48:19 It's my fishing. That's it. Are you prepared to see another ruined life join the others?
00:48:26 Your own. I have immunity to these things, you know? What I'm doing now, I think in a sense,
00:48:30 it's a common cause. It doesn't matter who it's gonna be: me or someone else. If someone else from Russia succeeds here,
00:48:39 I'll be ecstatic. I'm over it. I don't feel envy or jealousy about others' careers. Quite the opposite. I see these
00:48:47 things as... Well, not as a common cause. But it's cool, because what I'm doing here benefits
00:48:53 all Russian comedians. At first, they didn't even let us inside that club where we performed in Russian.
00:49:01 I'll show you. [In December of 2018, Nezlobin did a show] [in Russian in the legendary Improv club] where we performed in Russian.
00:49:02 I'll show you. [In December of 2018, Nezlobin did a show] [in Russian in the legendary Improv club] They didn't let us perform
00:49:04 in Russian. [In December of 2018, Nezlobin did a show] [in Russian in the legendary Improv club] Now they go, "Oh, guys, hello!"
00:49:06 Completely different. Now they go, "Oh, guys, hello!" Completely different. Did you envy others'
00:49:10 careers? Of course I did. How does it manifest?
00:49:15 Do you look at Volya* and go, "Motherfu..." [*Pavel Volya, Nezlobin's Comedy Club colleague] No, I never envied the guys.
00:49:19 It's just general competition, when you... Not against someone in particular.
00:49:23 But when someone does something successful, you go... (Panicked sounds.) I don't do that anymore. I just go: awesome!
00:49:28 This surprises some people in Russia. Guys were doing a show in Riga or something. I came down.
00:49:36 I went: "This is so cool! Good for you! I'm so glad!" And people were a bit perplexed, as if: is he making fun of us?
00:49:43 - "Fucking weirdo." - Yeah. But it was honest.
00:49:46 Besides, if we look at it from a purely capitalist angle, the more successful people surround you, the better it is for you.
00:50:00 You said on multiple occasions that our nation, our people are a lot more talented than they think of themselves.
00:50:07 - A hundred percent. - Can you elaborate? I think, after 70 years of communism
00:50:16 and of this almost slave-like treatment, I'm not saying it's happening now or whatever, but this overarching mentality
00:50:28 that the crowd is more important than an individual, we kind of lost our freedom
00:50:36 in looking at things. Basically, we look at the world in a very specific way in terms of what's right and
00:50:43 what's wrong. And we don't let ourselves ask questions like: "Why do I look at this thing this way? "Why can't I turn it over and look at
00:50:51 it differently?" Here's an example. I studied at VGIK.
00:50:59 My mentor was Vadim Yusov, an amazing Soviet cinematographer who worked with Tarkovsky. [Vadim Yusov: Walking the Streets of Moscow,] [Andrei Rublev, Solaris] My mentor was Vadim Yusov, an amazing Soviet
00:51:02 cinematographer who worked with Tarkovsky. [Vadim Yusov: Walking the Streets of Moscow,] [Andrei Rublev, Solaris] And we learned a kind of grammar:
00:51:03 "This is what 'correct' and 'good' look like." And we learned a kind of grammar: "This is what 'correct' and 'good' look like." But the more I work, the clearer it becomes
00:51:08 that in reality... Especially in Scandinavia. A Scandinavian cinematographer shows up and he does things I know I'll never
00:51:16 be able to do. Not because I'm not talented enough, but because I grew up in a different social
00:51:22 environment. In an environment where since early childhood, you're forbidden to look at things
00:51:30 differently. I can't explain this. It's like... Take painting, right?
00:51:39 We have the great Russian literature. But do we have great painting?
00:51:43 With all due respect, classic Russian painting is... Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and all the other OGs at Prado are out of our league.
00:51:50 We'll never be as good. Never. There was change early in the 20 century, after the revolution, with constructivism.
00:51:58 El Lissitzky, Chagall, Malevich. After the fall of czarist Russia, these people suddenly felt incredible freedom, they said: "Screw y'all, we'll just paint
00:52:08 a black square!" They changed art. Then you-know-who came,
00:52:16 and we got 70 years of rules, social realism, and so on, and so forth, which killed all visual
00:52:23 culture. And it started to more or less come back to life in late '80s and early '90s. But it never recovered to where it was in
00:52:30 early 20 century. And I think it's because of the fact that visual art — some might argue that it's
00:52:39 provocative. But what is Van Gogh? It's a look at the world from a completely different angle. "I don't paint what I see.
00:52:48 I paint what I feel." We as a nation, in our perception of painting and art in general, are very narrow-minded.
00:52:59 We don't know how to find a new perspective. It's hard for us to... We're good at replicating. We can't pick a reference and...
00:53:08 But to come up with something of our own that would take the world by storm — with that, we struggle.
00:53:16 And I think the only industry, and the people I meet, capable of these things, is the IT crowd.
00:53:22 'Cause LA has a huge community of people, not just from movies, but from show business and entertainment in general,
00:53:31 but it also has a huge IT community. And I spend even more time with them,
00:53:36 'cause they're fascinating people who see the world at a different angle. You can learn some things from them.
00:53:43 I mean... I personally think that if we completely abandoned
00:53:47 the idea of trying to do "like them" and started doing from the point of what's
00:53:54 important to US and how WE want to present the world, I think Russia would've been
00:54:00 a lot richer in terms of visual arts like film, painting, photography, and so on. So you're saying it's wrong to look to
00:54:09 the successful Western world of entertainment? It is, because our results will
00:54:15 always be inferior. Even if you go balls to the wall, and go, "We're making Russian
00:54:20 Transformers!" I actually get emails and scripts like: "We're filming a Russian
00:54:26 Harry Potter!" "We're filming a Russian Lord of the Rings." It's impossible, because we don't have the
00:54:31 industry for it. At the same time, we have the brilliant Filatov with his Tale of Fedot the Strelets. [Leonid Filatov]
00:54:37 [The Tale of Fedot the Strelets (1988)] [Kinopoisk rating: 8.3] At the same time, we have the brilliant Filatov with his Tale of Fedot the Strelets.
00:54:38 [Leonid Filatov] [The Tale of Fedot the Strelets (1988)] [Kinopoisk rating: 8.3] It's cool. It's really cool. It's folklore.
00:54:42 And I can tell you that... Kirill Serebrennikov's wonderful film Leto recently came out.
00:54:49 I enjoyed it immensely, and I think it's his best one yet. I have great respect for Kirill, though I've never met him.
00:54:57 I would love to shoot something for him. Yeah. And I thought: how would people abroad
00:55:03 perceive Kino and Tsoi, and will they GET it? 'Cause it's something ours, Russian.
00:55:09 And you know, I have a close friend, a producer named Jon Kilik. [Jon Kilik] [Producer (Babel, Inside Man, A Bronx Tale)]
00:55:12 He produced films directed by Julian Schnabel, Spike Lee, Oliver Stone. [Jon Kilik] [Producer (Babel, Inside Man, A Bronx Tale)]
00:55:18 He was at the Cannes Film Festival where they screened Leto. He was at the Cannes Festival where they screened Leto.
00:55:20 And he told me: "I saw it. It's a wonderful film!" This just goes to show that we have things to say.
00:55:25 We just need to say things we know rather than those we don't, while copying what they do over there and doing it a hundred times worse.
00:55:33 What amazes me the most is that I thought you step on a rake ONCE, and that's it. But this rake feels endless.
00:55:40 We keep stepping on it. And that amazes me. But...
00:55:46 People will tell you then, in the comments or whatever: Wait a minute! But you moved to LA!
00:55:52 You shoot there. You create American product — one way or another.
00:55:58 You make... What's your response? Well, my response is that I create it there because it's where it's made.
00:56:06 - 'Cause it's about America and... - I don't mean geography. I don't mean geography. You're not a government official after all.
00:56:12 Do you shoot as a disciple of the Russian cinema school? Absolutely. When I was shooting Fury,
00:56:18 I showed the director, David Ayer, films like Alexei German Sr.'s My Friend Ivan Lapshin,
00:56:24 Trial on the Road — Soviet films. We made a Soviet film with Brad Pitt. 100%.
00:56:29 'Cause I knew that I... I knew that everything I had to say myself could only come from my
00:56:34 background, meaning my personal experience. In the current episode,
00:56:41 we're showing three people taking on the States. Interestingly, the two other people are trying to do it
00:56:49 with the American product. But in another craft, not in cinema.
00:56:55 They're a stand-up comedian and a rock musician. Yours is a different story. You became a star in Russia,
00:57:00 and they shipped you in just like they ship stars from Argentine River Plate...
00:57:07 - What? - Golovin in Monaco. - Yeah, yeah, basically. You believe in the idea of becoming a Golovin in Russia prior to leaving.
00:57:16 I'd say, yes. I believe in the idea that... It's just that I saw people show up with nothing to offer.
00:57:22 They stay in perpetual limbo. Perpetually with nothing to offer.
00:57:27 Because chances of you being given a chance there are minuscule. Can you briefly, in a couple of dozen seconds, answer the question:
00:57:39 why you swapped TNT for STS? [Nezlobin moved to STS in summer of 2018] [together with Sergei Svetlakov]
00:57:42 Because I stopped growing there and [Nezlobin moved to STS in summer of 2018] [together with Sergei Svetlakov]
00:57:45 the limitation of my artistic freedom wasn't adequately compensated. the limitation of my artistic freedom wasn't adequately compensated.
00:57:49 Give me an example of artistic un-freedom on TNT. When you can... When you can't...
00:57:57 You don't have the time or the freedom to — and please note that I'm not accusing anyone.
00:58:03 TNT gave me something amazing. On the other hand, if I didn't make them money, they wouldn't have.
00:58:09 I was able to work next to Garik Martirosyan for ten years. This is awesome for me.
00:58:16 He helped me write and come up with things. He would sometimes say: "Nezlobin, your way isn't funny. Here's how it's funny,"* —
00:58:19 [*Parodies thick Armenian accent] and produce an eight-minute tirade on the spot. I'm very grateful to him. And to
00:58:26 Artur Janibekyan, who bought me a compartment (!) train ticket to Moscow. And to everyone who worked
00:58:34 there. But the thing is... Our show, Comedy Club, operated then in such a way
00:58:43 that you couldn't do anything else in your life beside it. And... It took up all of your time.
00:58:50 Like, when you're writing a stand-up show, you can do a lot of things, but they won't work on TV.
00:58:58 Sometimes, you need to make a pause, let people think, you know? And we were slotted on Friday, what, 9 PM?
00:59:04 In the epicenter of TV fray where you got The Voice contest! A one-legged man crying! Mother ate her kid!
00:59:12 Who was scheduled for the Voice. In that slot, you can't go, "You know, I think...
00:59:19 "What's the deal with speed bumps?" You cannot say that.
00:59:23 You know? So it's like... So what were you supposed to do? Quick jokes. "Right!"
00:59:28 You come up. The previous skit ended on sex. You know? You can't say, "You know, my grandpa used to tell me..."
00:59:36 No, you come up, you make a dick joke. Okay, you got the attention, caught the previous wave.
00:59:40 You can try to put some thinking inside the bit. But again, be brief and fast, fast, fast.
00:59:45 I got tired of it, 'cause I wanna do the "express myself" thing.
00:59:51 I think I'm completely different to what you saw on that show.
00:59:58 First thing you and Svetlakov made on STS was Thank God You're Here. Do you agree that the first season was very bad?
01:00:09 It didn't come out as we wanted it to, I agree. "Very bad" is what I'd call some other certain works.
01:00:17 I can't say it was good. That's for sure. Yeah. I'm definitely to blame for
01:00:24 the fact that scripts didn't reflect the quality that we envisioned.
01:00:32 But, you know... What can I say? That's why we have season two coming. Let's see how that looks. How did you learn
01:00:39 English? I learned it like probably a lot of people, in school. But you know, it had very little to do with
01:00:44 actual English. Coming here, I thought my English was more or less adequate. 'Cause I mostly talked to non-native speakers.
01:00:55 Germans and so on. It seemed okay. But when I came here, my mind was blown,
01:01:03 because my first crowd here was mostly rock musicians.
01:01:09 But rock musicians in California, and in LA in particular, do blow like there's no tomorrow. So in addition to the fact that they're native speakers and don't exactly talk like...
01:01:21 - Germans, Indians, and so on. - Germans, yeah. They talk extremely fast and without pauses.
01:01:26 Because they're always coked up. So at first I was like, "What the hell is going on?
01:01:30 "I need to take a course or something." [The school where Stravinsky is studying] So I'm taking an English course at a school, and it's helping out a lot.
01:01:36 It broke down a lot of things I didn't understand. About The Groom. First of all. It brought a profit, right?
01:01:42 [Nezlobin wrote and directed] About The Groom. First of all. It brought a profit, right? [Nezlobin wrote and directed]
01:01:44 Yes, it's our first profitable film. You spent a million bucks. How much did it make?
01:01:49 Something like that. It made 460 or 500-something. [The Groom made $7.7 million at the box office] [(taken from Kinopoisk)] Something like that. It made 460 or
01:01:53 500-something. [The Groom made $7.7 million at the box office] [(taken from Kinopoisk)] - 500 million.
01:01:53 - No! 550 or something. [The Groom made $7.7 million at the box office] [(taken from Kinopoisk)] The finale.
01:01:59 [We're gonna spoil The Groom] [If you care, fast forward 5 minutes] What the fuck? What specifically?
01:02:08 The fact that... - The fact that she comes back? - Spoilers! She comes back.
01:02:12 - Yes. - She comes back, and it makes no sense. I don't want to be Zhenya BadComedian, who would say:
01:02:18 "What does he love her for?!" You don't fucking love FOR something.
01:02:22 It's chemistry, sparks, and so on. I GET it. But that was just complete...
01:02:29 - That cannot happen! - In short... That cannot happen.
01:02:33 I'll give you a short answer. To me, it can and it does happen.
01:02:37 'Cause we had a full stop in our script. Where she leaves. No, immediately, when we sat to write,
01:02:43 when we realized we needed to put in the German guy to add comedy, we realized that... She has to leave with the German.
01:02:51 I remember saying: "Seryi, let's make her leave with the German. "'Cause otherwise they'll accuse us of propaganda. That Russians are so great, you know?"
01:02:58 He goes, "Yeah, absolutely." Then we started writing and we knew: she can't leave with him. More so!
01:03:04 In the book, he saves a cat. In our script, as I mentioned, he dragged the German from fire,
01:03:09 gave him to her and said: "Be with him." And she left with him. That was his only good deed in the whole film.
01:03:15 Which we then cut. But I didn't like that it was so much like the book. Instead, I played the art film card to show that that's
01:03:21 what happens, that's a Russian wom... You never heard stories like that? I have a billion stories from
01:03:26 Sverdlovsk Oblast, where the husband is bad, he's a wife-beater, he cheats, and so on, and she finds a good alternative, but she
01:03:34 can't go through with it! She comes back to live with the drunk. After the credits, Svetlakov's character got drunk
01:03:40 and fucked someone. Let's say, right? - That's life. - Did you shoot that?
01:03:49 No. That's just life. She regretted her decision many times. Don't you know Russian women who wash
01:03:54 dishes thinking: "Fuck. I had Fedya Viktorov from class 7-B. "He's now...
01:04:04 - How do you explain it? - "Makes music with foam sheets." How do you?.. I wanted to say "a deputy," then decided to stick with young people.
01:04:12 - How do I explain it? - Yes. Russian women... - Because Russians love to suffer. We love suffering.
01:04:17 We really love suffering. We have to get resistance everywhere.
01:04:22 I have a few friends in America, who attained success in their careers, but they have sad eyes.
01:04:31 'Cause they do something... They have carefree lives. They don't have this "in spite of" plight.
01:04:36 We? We had to wear a hat and march to school. You're doing it in spite of. You wake up in the morning and you do everything in spite of!
01:04:44 I don't like it, but I will! We have that. We can't just enjoy life.
01:04:50 When I was a pioneer counselor and mentor at summer camp, I remember the camp's director telling me,
01:04:59 Natalya Sergeyevna, she said, "Nezlobin, why do you suffer so much? "Why are you like this? It's like you enjoy suffering."
01:05:06 We have that in us, I think. We... No! Our parents.
01:05:10 "No! We will sleep on the floor! "Let the kids sleep on the bed!"
01:05:15 I mean fuck! You're old. You have back problems. YOU should sleep on the bed, and kids, on the floor.
01:05:22 'Cause they'll recover from it. Why do our parents avoid going to the doctor?
01:05:27 Because in the Soviet times, they were told the story of the Spartan boy who picked up a fox cub and endured.
01:05:32 You know this tale? He picked up a little fox, put it under his shirt, and endured. The little fox got hungry but couldn't get out,
01:05:41 so he started biting into the boy's stomach and eating it. But the boy endured it because it was in class,
01:05:46 so he kept silent and died. So our parents go: "I'm fine! What doctor? It's 2,500 rubles. I'm fine."
01:05:56 They want to go, but they don't. 'Cause "it's fine, I'll just stay here..."
01:06:00 My mom always asks: "Can I get a ticket to your show? "Not in the center. Somewhere in the corner. In the back.
01:06:06 "I'll just stand on broken glass. "Somewhere dark where I can't see you. Other room's okay, as long as I can hear."
01:06:12 Just stop. Simply ask, "Can I get a ticket to your show?" Of course you can. There's always a ticket for you.
01:06:20 Even if there isn't one, we'll throw someone out. But this, "No, it's fine..."
01:06:27 We love to suffer, Yura. Do you know why Suicide Squad was panned by critics?
01:06:31 [Suicide Squad] [Budget - $175 000 000] [International box office - $746 846 894] Do you know why Suicide Squad was panned by critics?
01:06:33 [Suicide Squad] [Budget - $175 000 000] [International box office - $746 846 894] - Of course.
01:06:33 - Why? Because key script-related matters weren't resolved at the point when they were
01:06:40 supposed to. Why did that happen? Because movies like that
01:06:49 are rushing trains. And directors often find themselves inside a rushing train that they can't stop. So they have to solve problems
01:06:58 on the go. There are examples of successes, where this crisis management works. And there are failures.
01:07:09 And I think that probably, definitely, unfortunately, Suicide Squad was an example of a failure in that regard.
01:07:18 Though it was very successful commercially. But of course, when we were shooting it, we wanted
01:07:24 both critics and viewers to like it. But, well, things happened. Two days ago, I saw Joe Rogan here.
01:07:32 It's on his podcast that Elon Musk smoked some weed, which sent Tesla stock tumbling. They're still falling. It's still echoing.
01:07:40 Joe Rogan says, "Leave Musk alone!" He goes: "What's wrong with you? He's creating the future. He can do whatever he wants!
01:07:47 "Can you create an electric car? How about you?" He had a very funny bit on the subject.
01:07:51 Joe Rogan does shows here all the time, even though the place only has 200 seats, and the money is laughable to them.
01:07:57 But they do it for the culture. First, you go to open mics.
01:08:00 You go to open mics and nobody cares about you. Then someone notices you.
01:08:06 You get through in some... There will be a guy who selects people will be at one of the open mics.
01:08:11 They email you, saying, "We wanna book you for a show." This happened to me at Flappers.
01:08:16 They first booked me for a room that only fit eight people. - Viewers? - Viewers.
01:08:22 Eight people. - It's like if every comedian brought a friend. - Right. You do the show. I spent twelve hours on a
01:08:27 plane for that, dude. I flew in, did the show, and flew back. I thought I was flying to
01:08:35 do a SHOW. They said: "This is a Friday show. We booked you." I'm going, "Finally!"
01:08:40 I get on the plane. I arrive, and the room is this small. It's tiny. Now, they book me for the
01:08:48 main room. That room can fit up to 150 people. That's for when comedians bring their parents.
01:08:54 And their friends. I don't know who those people are and how they get there. But it's all for free
01:09:00 so far. I've played there three times, and I plan to say, "Guys, can you pay me at least a dollar?" 'Cause it's a different
01:09:06 experience. Yeah, yeah. Free labor and not free labor. Yes. I'd perform for a
01:09:10 dollar. So. But that's that club. Down there, I'm already a...
01:09:16 I get use the dressing room. I get free water. I'm now a privileged... loser.
01:09:24 So. [Privileged loser] Down here,
01:09:30 I also went to open mics. The sold out show was here. I think it helped a little.
01:09:34 [The mentioned sold out show was in Russian] I think it helped a little. [The mentioned sold out show was in Russian] I sent a recording to the other
01:09:35 manager. [The mentioned sold out show was in Russian] Four months later... From the other club.
01:09:39 Four months later... From the other club. Four months later, they watched it.
01:09:44 I was about to fly home, and they go... It's always the same! As soon as I...
01:09:48 You're about to go home. They what? - They gave me five minutes. They said... - How many people?
01:09:52 It's gonna be people selected at open mics. So it's gonna be cool openmicers.
01:09:58 - People who showed themselves at open mics... - Cool, privileged losers. Yes. And we'll have a Rita in, who selects people for the main room.
01:10:09 The next step, probably, is, if you get into the main room, is you're on warm-up. In "Joe Rogan and
01:10:15 Friends." And four or five people do their bits before Joe Rogan comes on. But instead of Joe Rogan it's gonna
01:10:20 be some... Alycia Cooper. Whoever she is. - We don't know her.
01:10:26 - But some headliner. - Yeah And you're opening for him.
01:10:31 And there are several people like you. So it's step, by step, by step.
01:10:34 You said many times in interviews that the key difference, or one of the key differences,
01:10:40 between Russian and American film industries, is the brutal professional competition over yonder.
01:10:47 Can you give a classic example of this competition? As many as you want. There was a project recently with Spike Lee attached to direct.
01:10:56 And they were looking for a cinematographer for this project. And obviously, a lot of people wanted the job,
01:11:01 'cause Spike Lee is a classic director. I heard, I don't know how accurate this information is, but they got around eighty applications
01:11:08 for the job. And that's eighty A-listers. Meaning, these aren't just any cinematographers. These people have amazing careers.
01:11:21 That means there's at least eighty of them, which is an enormous number of ultra professionals
01:11:28 willing to work and do certain things quite often, if the project is interesting enough, for any sort of money.
01:11:36 So you definitely can't work willy-nilly there. Another thing is that
01:11:43 there's always new blood arriving. 'Cause what makes America great?
01:11:48 I think, if America suddenly closed all borders and only used home talent, I think, things would not have been as rosy.
01:11:56 But because America attracts talent from all over the world, they buy small European companies,
01:12:02 transform and integrate them into huge corporations, they can bring in a person from a small country
01:12:11 who shot a YouTube video that got a lot of views. They call him up: "Would you like to (same happened to me)
01:12:16 "come over and create something here?" As a result, this upward pressure is huge.
01:12:22 At some point, you turn on a video, and you've been thinking: "I shot something. It looks good. I'm probably good,"
01:12:28 then you click on some video on the Internet and you go, "Who shot this?" And it turns out, the person is 21 years old,
01:12:35 and they've been filming with a handheld prior to this. You realize that even if you did your damnedest, you couldn't repeat that,
01:12:42 because this person sees the world differently, they're from a different generation. This serves as perpetual motivation.
01:12:50 And for the longest time, I was in this stressful state. Like, you wake up in a cold sweat thinking,
01:12:58 "I need to make something right now!" But then I realized that you can't live like that,
01:13:04 because with a creative job, there are two ways to go about it.
01:13:11 I call the first one 'the Olympics.' It's basically you going:
01:13:16 "We're gonna do better than them. We'll try harder than them!" But there's a chance that you don't get a medal. And the result is depression.
01:13:26 The second way, which I find... and which I eventually adopted, is to do what you like and take on
01:13:30 what you like, and, let's say, try not to... sort of...
01:13:40 lie to yourself... but trust your intuition. And it took me
01:13:49 a while to get to this. I really like competition and the struggle itself.
01:13:56 Yeah, but I realized you can't live your whole life like that. There are people, we all know some of them,
01:14:02 who do live their whole lives like that and then really regret it.
01:14:06 That's why I live in a more balanced state nowadays. - People like who? - Like Steve Jobs.
01:14:12 This was a man who created the greatest gadgets and the greatest corporation, but who couldn't...
01:14:20 connect with his own daughter. Isn't that the tragedy? - I mean isn't that... - You mean personally?
01:14:26 Yeah! That's what the movie is basically about. Jobs is a film about a man who runs around and sees the future,
01:14:32 that people will use their phones differently. There's his daughter holding a music player, and he won't even admit she's his daughter.
01:14:38 Realistically, this is a story that asks how willing you are to forfeit your real life and embrace the unreal one to achieve something in it.
01:14:50 This is the Mecca of stand-up comedy. I can even see 'Eddie Murphy' written there.
01:14:55 This is... This is probably the most famous club in the world, has to be. Because it was one of the first ones to open.
01:15:00 Basically, everyone performed here. America saw an explosion in popularity of this type of comedy in the '80s. And I think what happened here in the '80s is
01:15:08 happening today in Russia. Because it's blowing up, and we have so many great comedians. We have awesome underground
01:15:17 comedy. It's great that this thing is blowing up wide. It used to be that one TV channel held a
01:15:24 monopoly on this stuff. - Nowadays... - TNT and the TV show where you... Thankfully, streams are shooting
01:15:30 everywhere, and it belongs to the people now. - Streams of what?
01:15:35 - Streams of quality comedy. As a cinematographer, what are the three most beautiful scenes in the history of cinema?
01:15:47 [Warning!] [Spoilers in the next 40 seconds] Andrei Rublev. The scene of taking the stronghold with the burning horse.
01:15:52 It's shot in a single long take. I think it's a masterpiece. Then the entrance and introduction of the young emperor
01:16:00 in Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, where a little becomes the emperor.
01:16:05 It's another scene without any dialogue where the visual part alone overwhelms you completely.
01:16:14 And number three... It too needs to be something simple, but at the same time... I think it's American Beauty. Where the gun approaches from the back and shoots him.
01:16:24 Because... There are actually very few people today, especially among directors,
01:16:30 who can speak with the camera. They value dialogue and words more, believing the picture is irrelevant,
01:16:38 as long as the dialogues are written properly. The most recent example is the Russian TV show called
01:16:45 Call DiCaprio! The cinematography is pretty simplistic. But it has other qualities and
01:16:50 people dig it. And you could arguably film everything this way. But if you look at great
01:16:55 directors, Kubrick, Paul Thomas Anderson, Martin Scorsese, Tarkovsky, Bondarchuk Sr.,
01:17:07 these people could speak with the camera without words and make you feel with the camera.
01:17:14 I think this is the real tour de force in cinema — when the picture, the sound, the dialogues, the music,
01:17:21 all work together to create that for which we love cinema,
01:17:27 where you enter a dark room and forget about your life for two-ish hours and come out a changed person.
01:17:33 I think in Russia, Andrey Zvyagintsev does that today, where seemingly simplistic imagery from Misha Krichman,
01:17:41 whom I'm honored to know personally and consider one of the most talented cinematographers — in the world, actually.
01:17:48 So he... They do that. It always amazes, but it always requires hard work. But on the commercial side of the film industry,
01:17:54 like what we have in America, it's very hard to achieve that, because you need the director to be on your side to
01:18:02 fight for your visual method. Because this usually implies time and money. And people get nervous and unresponsive
01:18:09 when you mention those. They go: "Do we really need the long take? "Let's do a close-up of him, a close-up of him,
01:18:15 a wide shot, and move on." Yeah. So you need to fight for it. And so I think the most visually
01:18:20 spectacular films of the last five years were shot by Mexicans: Cuarón, Iñárritu, Emmanuel Lubezki,
01:18:28 because these guys act like gopniks, in a good way. They go: "Fuck off. We'll shoot how we like."
01:18:35 At that point, this whole Hollywood machine goes... And everyone freezes. They go: "No, no, we'll have DiCaprio. We'll shoot for six months. He'll crawl in snow.
01:18:44 "We don't care that he's cold or not." 'Cause 80% of directors would've said:
01:18:49 "What? No! We'll use chroma key. We can't put him into real snow! We'll use chroma key." Meaning, this fear that
01:18:58 you won't wrap on time, that it'll take too long, that "we're biting more than we can chew"
01:19:07 is so great that people don't even go there. While these guys... They doubled the film's budget, didn't they?
01:19:15 Yeah, the filming budget. It was a year-long shoot. They were basically shooting like Tarkovsky in the Soviet Union.
01:19:20 They started filming, then went: "Wrong weather. Gotta wait for snow." And they did. So they almost never make movies like that in the world.
01:19:28 You mean they usually shoot stuff like that with chroma key? - No. The Revenant was... - No, no, not them. The rest.
01:19:33 Yeah! Watch something like Everest. I read the script, I was offered to shoot it.
01:19:38 It's an awesome story about people trying to climb the Everest. And the original idea was to go to the Everest and shoot them climbing it.
01:19:46 But then they went, "Wait, but the actors, the insurance..." So they went with chroma key.
01:19:50 When you're watching it, it's obvious, and you lose the sense of reality, you stop believing, and the movie's done.
01:19:56 Movie magic is gone. Movie magic is gone, because nothing beats reality. So for example, even in my latest film, 
01:20:02 there's kind of a  journey, it's called Triple Frontier, through jungle  and mountains. We tried to shoot outside, on location, as 
01:20:11 much as possible and only add very distant backgrounds  on the computer. We didn't want to
01:20:22 just film the actors with chroma key and draw  everything in post-production. 'Cause if you're making a comic  book movie,
01:20:29 then it's conceptual and it looks  appropriate. But if it's a film about real people fighting  for their lives,
01:20:37 in my opinion, it just doesn't  work, no matter the budget and the studio  doing the effects.
01:20:43 How does your wife react to your attempts  to conquer... I mean, you're spending family  money
01:20:51 in large amounts —  to fly here... - You saw I don't overspend. - Yes.
01:20:56 I fly coach. I use the free miles I accumulated  on business flights in Russia. So I try to spend as little as possible  on my hobby.
01:21:04 I mean, if I was collecting motorcycles,  or computers, or planes, it would've been more  expensive.
01:21:11 Still, you spend time. And wives react to it...  well, appropriately. They're not happy.
01:21:18 - Time's more precious than money, yeah. - Yes. What are your discussions  about it like?
01:21:23 Does she say: "Sasha, can you stop  fucking about? "Just make the second season of Thank God  You're Here better than the first one."
01:21:30 "Eat a sandwich and  sit on... the couch?" No.
01:21:36 I'm very grateful  to her. First off, I attribute my career  breakthroughs to her,
01:21:44 because it was she who changed my  self-esteem and made me believe in myself,  that I'm fun after all.
01:21:51 Even performing on a popular  show, I still had major confidence  problems.
01:21:59 Does she get the  purpose? Doubt it. But she understand  that I...
01:22:06 That doing this, I'll be  happier. She says: "Why should I prefer an  unhappy you
01:22:13 "here "to having less of you but  happy." That's touching.
01:22:23 But when my wife video calls me and I see  my daughter, I start thinking: "What am I doing here?  Career? What for?
01:22:32 "Why am I doing this? Who know how  much I have left, "and I'm spending this time  in a line."
01:22:38 I'm standing in line, but overall, it's not gonna  change my life, you know? Even if I get somewhere  here.
01:22:44 But my daughter will  grow up. And I think, "I'm wasting my time  on bullshit.
01:22:48 "That's it. Tickets, pronto." I end the call and I think:  I gotta go home. But then Danya calls and says: 
01:22:55 "Hey, Improv called.  "They have a spot on Sunday, but you need to  stay for two more days." And I'm like...
01:23:05 I think, "Okay, two more  days." But it's hard. It's hard to stay for these two  extra days.
01:23:13 But outside of video calls,  it's easier. If you have to come  back...
01:23:19 - 'Cause your visa runs out in a year. - Yes. How are they gonna decide to  extend it or not?
01:23:24 I need to show my work here as much  as possible. So yeah, for now, it's a 
01:23:29 big issue. If you have to come back, what are  you gonna feel? - I mean damn...
01:23:37 - Will you feel that you shit the bed? Not really, no. To that, I kinda got  used to.
01:23:45 Initially, when I was  leaving, I saw this,
01:23:49 that everyone in Russia wants  you to fail. I mean... People who know you a little bit  do want
01:23:58 you to fail. I don't mean friends.  I mean acquaintances. 
01:24:06 They figure, they'll never risk doing something  like this themselves, but if someone else does, they'll be real bitter  in the person succeeds.
01:24:16 Because of this... Well, unfortunately, we have  this in Russia.  People envy God knows  what.
01:24:23 If they lived like I have for ten  months, I think they would've looked at it very  differently.
01:24:30 Many will ask: dude, why overcomplicate?  If you want to write music in English, why move to LA? You can stay in Moscow.
01:24:40 - Moscow is a modern, European city... - Yes. Where people speak every  language.
01:24:46 You can stay and write  there. Little Big, I know they make a different  kind of music,
01:24:52 but still, staying in Saint Petersburg didn't  stop Little Big from going international and coming here this  spring with a tour. 
01:25:00 Half of their European tour is already  sold out. Yes, that's true. I think it's a different  deal.
01:25:07 I really wanted to soak in the vibe that  exists only here. When it's winter and -30 °C outside,  you can't
01:25:18 think about America and  whatnot and write music that they'd  dig here.
01:25:26 You're right about  Little Big. But they have a different  concept.
01:25:31 Their idea from the  get-go was: we're video makers, we shoot  videos,
01:25:37 and then the numbers  will tell. It's a huge amount  of work
01:25:42 that they did staying at home,  true. You can only respect and applaud them  for that.
01:25:53 But I wanted to do my thing  here and not be bothered, 'cause when you're  at home,
01:26:00 there's a bunch of  distractions: friends, drinks, parties,
01:26:06 girls, anything. Here, I can focus and sit down and write music, and not be  distracted. It's awesome.
01:26:15 Can you offer a few bits  of advice to guys like you in 2008, almost like  you in 2008,
01:26:24 who rejected their ability to eventually make more  with their craft in Russia because they can't resist America?  They can't resist it!
01:26:33 My first, well, it's not really advice, it's more  like observations. It's not advice, more like... Yeah I don't want  to advise anyone.
01:26:41 - Bits of experience. - Bits of my experience that might not even help. First, you need to have a clear idea why  you came to America.
01:26:48 Either because you feel good and  at home there or because you came to achieve  something.
01:26:54 'Cause a lot of people  mix up... Rather, can't quite comprehend the scenario  where they realize
01:27:01 they probably won't achieve anything, but they just  feel at home here. - These are different things. - More sunny days per year.
01:27:07 Of course! Second, I think  that... You need to properly account for  your abilities
01:27:16 in this American competition where the whole  country is all about it, where the culture of success and winning is king and  everyone chases after them.
01:27:25 You have to sometimes look around  in this race to see if you're running with the right people  and in the right direction,
01:27:31 'cause maybe you just need to step aside  and let them pass, and then get where you need to go at  your own pace.
01:27:37 I think being sober like that towards  this matter can really help achieve success,  achieve what you want.
01:27:45 And third, when you reach said  success, you need to keep in mind that it's  not forever,
01:27:51 that every success has a beginning and some  sort of an end. You can see it in biographies of great people,  great directors,
01:27:59 who first made great movies, then super  great movies, and then, for the longest time, really not  great movies.
01:28:07 I think you have to... The most important and impressive story is  to achieve success and then, if you happen to regress 
01:28:12 in your career, find the strength to get back  to the top. What are the examples in your profession, 
01:28:18 in cinema? In my profession, you can look at  Alfonso Cuarón,  who made
01:28:28 two successful films  first, then he made a very unsuccessful film  panned by critics.
01:28:34  It was a complete failure of a movie, and he  said it himself in interviews. Then he sat down, he thought a bit and went to Mexico with a handheld  camera and shot Y Tu Mamá También,
01:28:44 which has to be one of his  best films. Then he made  Children of Men.
01:28:48 Then he made Gravity. And then he  made Roma. This person did not panic because  of failure.
01:28:55 And I partly think that Andrey Zvyagintsev made  an amazing debut with The Return, which garnered a bunch  of awards.
01:29:04 Then he made a  sort of a  poorly understood, widely misunderstood and widely  rejected film The Banishment.
01:29:13 Despite winning Best Male Role at the  Cannes Film Festival, this film is very difficult. It's difficult  to approach.
01:29:20 And I think 90% of Russian  directors  would've said: "You're all morons.  You didn't get it."
01:29:27 And then they would've made  The Banishment 2, 3, 4, 5... But he sat down and  washed up,
01:29:34 and went on to make Elena,  then Leviathan, and then Loveless,
01:29:39 where he completely changed his  cinematic language and switched to literal scripts, and literal rules,  and literal drama.
01:29:48 He adopted those in place of,  let's say, a visually lyrical world, where names, objects, and other things are  not what they appear.
01:30:02 I love stories like that, 'cause to me, this ability to come back up  after falling is sometimes more powerful than the ability 
01:30:08 to just keep going. What is your ambition? My ambition is to shoot movies I'd want  to watch myself;
01:30:22 to work in both cinematography and, if what's  coming up works out... Actually, to try new things and grow  as a person
01:30:30 and just tell stories. Because I realized that's what I love most  about movies. You know, there's this gilded 
01:30:36 figurine... That ties into the previously mentioned  Olympics. I don't participate 
01:30:43 anymore. I think it's a horrible goal  to have. If I get it, cool. If I don't, 
01:30:48 cool still. What did you think of Leonardo  DiCaprio's story, whom this figurine 
01:30:54 kept... kept dodging. You know, I think Leonardo DiCaprio  is kind of a...
01:31:03 I mean, maybe he  wanted it. But he's such a smart  performer.
01:31:08 Did you know, for example, that Leonardo  DiCaprio buys scripts in which he will be able to play characters  in ten years?
01:31:18 In other words, in ten years, he will be  old Leonardo DiCaprio, and he already has three scripts with roles for  old Leonardo DiCaprio.
01:31:26 - You mean he'll produce AND play? - Yes. He knows that in ten years, he will be old  and right for this role,
01:31:32 but he buys this  script now. - And no one else can play it, because he bought it. - Yes.
01:31:37 So I was never worried for  DiCaprio. What do you have to achieve  here to say:
01:31:43 my conquest of the States  succeeded? I don't...
01:31:48 I don't dream of selling out something like  MGM Grand, you know? [MGM Grand is a hotel and casino in Las Vegas] I don't dream of selling out something like  MGM Grand, you know?
01:31:51 [MGM Grand is a hotel and casino in Las Vegas] But if I get featured in some show,  let's say, But if I get featured in some show, 
01:31:56 let's say, even on the Internet, on Netflix or  something, as part of something, 
01:32:00 then I... One of the guest  artists. Then I'll be content, 
01:32:04 yeah. I used to have a dream when  I was little. In my ninth year, I wanted to 
01:32:09 make a film. And my dream had an  extension — I wanted to get an Oscar, 
01:32:14 to win an Oscar. I dreamed of becoming a film director  before Comedy Club. I joined Comedy because I figured it was 
01:32:20 a shorter path to cinema than Sverdlovsk Film  School. So... I attended it. 
01:32:26 In Sverdlovsk. I wanted to come up on stage  with the Oscar.  I even rehearsed a speech. You know 
01:32:31 when you... When you're falling asleep or  showering, you sometimes answer Pozner's 
01:32:37 questions.  From Proust Questionnaire. After you came along, I started answering  your flash quiz.
01:32:47 I'm in the shower, rubbing myself, thinking:  "I if stood before..." I thought I'd win an Oscar  and say:
01:32:53 "See? We, Russians, aren't  idiots. "As you're used to  thinking."
01:32:59 This used to really  bother me. I'd go: "We don't have bears in  the streets.
01:33:03 "We, too, can make good  films. "Thank you, and don't think  ill of us.'
01:33:09 Something like that,  you know? But because Oscar is  becoming...
01:33:13 The Oscars are dying, like television  is dying. The Oscars are dying as  an award.
01:33:20 I don't want to win it  anymore. - But through stand-up... - But the idea is the same.
01:33:24 Yeah, I'm saying with my stand-up  comedy that... guys, we exist too.
01:33:31 What's the ultimate goal of  your trip? What has to happen to make you say:  this wasn't a waste.
01:33:38 I can already say that it wasn't  a waste. Again, I radically changed mentally  and musically.
01:33:48 Truly radically. I can't say what's coming for me  or that in case I end up failing
01:33:57 and they don't extend my visa,  I won't go home. I won't say that. Obviously, I'll give it my all  to stay.
01:34:06 But I don't regret coming,  100%. I realize now that the time I spent comfortably  I flushed down the toilet.
01:34:15 I really did, in the sense that I could've done  so much more, compared to simply...
01:34:22 basically, going to work. Touring was work. I wasn't creating  anything. I wasn't thinking or coming up 
01:34:27 with things. I mean, yeah, I did something, but it  was meager. The relationship between Russia and the 
01:34:34 USA is bad. Does it somehow  affect you? Americans are actually 
01:34:39 very... not just not racist, but extremely tolerant  to other cultures. That's a part of their 
01:34:48 culture. They have a special attitude towards  Russians. It's usually kind of 
01:34:53 wary-inquisitive, or wary- respectful? It's hard to  explain.
01:35:05 But it's completely different to how they treat  the French, the Italians, the British. With them, they're the way we are with  Belorussians or Ukrainians.
01:35:14 - There's a feeling of friendship, love... - Brotherhood! To us, they're like,  "Yeah, hi."
01:35:18 And a slightly inspecting  look. But it has no effect. They're perfectly open.  I have a lot of friends.
01:35:25 But after Mr. Trump took  office, well, there was a sensation  of hysteria
01:35:33 about Russia and  Russians. And there was a sort of, I wouldn't call  it a witch hunt,
01:35:39 it's probably too  dramatic, but a bit of a re-evaluation of disposition  towards us.
01:35:44 Obviously, smarter people didn't  partake in it at all. But we only have ourselves to blame for their  wary disposition.
01:35:53 I believe this applies to most cases.  I'll explain. I travel around the world  a lot.
01:35:59 I've been to and worked in many  countries. I arrive. Someone asks: "Where are you from?"  "I'm from Russia."
01:36:06 "Yeah, yeah, my grandpa's  from there,  from western Ukraine. "They ran away from the army."  "Yeah, it happened a lot during WWII."
01:36:14 In another place. "Where are you from?"  "Russia." "Yeah, I have relatives in  Hungary.
01:36:18 "They fled after the  revolution hit." "Where are you from?" "Russia."  "You guys make good weapons."
01:36:25 And at some point,  you feel that you would prefer to hear people say:  "Yeah, I read War and Peace. It's brilliant.
01:36:31 "Russian writers are  great." But everywhere we go we leave a  trail of violence.
01:36:37 Maybe we do it involuntarily.  To survive. But it ends up becoming our thing, our main  feature kind of deal.
01:36:46 And a lot of people are  proud that we are so strong and can kick  someone's ass.
01:36:52 But in me, it only evokes  confusion. Because Russian culture, Russian people...  Take the recent World Cup
01:37:01 that two of my friends came  to watch. My assistants came to  Russia,
01:37:05 they said: "Dude, Moscow is my  favorite city now. "I want to live here. Moscow and Paris are two  of the biggest cities in my life."
01:37:11 We're incredibly hospitable, perfectly European,  perfectly normal. We just need to drop our inferiority  complex 
01:37:20 and stop compensating it with endless  aggression. We need to be who  we are —
01:37:25 a normal, friendly, talented, and open  nation. And I think it's sad what happened during  the World Cup,
01:37:34 when they canceled foreigners'  visas. They could've come and seen that we don't  have bears in the streets,
01:37:39 that people are cheerful and nobody's  mugging them, that we have clean streets, beautiful girls,  a wonderful cuisine.
01:37:46 That's what we need to do —  open the country and let people from around the world come and  see how beautiful it is.
01:37:53 Then, when they meet you abroad,  they won't recall that their grandpa fled the  reds.
01:37:58 They'll say: "We've been to Russia.  It was cool." I think that's important.  The second thing
01:38:04 which I find our major problem is that  we live in the past. I left in 2008. I'd tune into Echo of Moscow  radio station
01:38:12 and hear discussions of whether Stalin  was good or bad. I came back in 2018. I tuned into Echo of Moscow:  "Was Stalin good or bad?"
01:38:20 All I hear in America is: "In 30 years, we'll have a base on Mars with  1000 people producing oxygen, "this oxygen will become..."
01:38:29 "We can live forever!" "We will travel to other planets!" Their nation lives in the future.  We live in the past.
01:38:34 As long as we live in the past, nothing is  gonna change. We'll be stuck in this karmic cycle  with no escape.
01:38:42 And yeah, people WILL resent and  mistrust us, and we will feel  uncomfortable.
01:38:47 So the sooner we move on to the future and  let go of the past, the sooner the way people feel about  us will change.
01:38:54 And every person, Russian and non-Russian  but from Russia, from our huge multi-ethnic  country,
