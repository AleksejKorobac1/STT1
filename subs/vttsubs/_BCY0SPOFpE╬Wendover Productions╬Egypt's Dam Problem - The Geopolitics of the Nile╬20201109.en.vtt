00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.900
the description.
This is the Nile River—perhaps the single

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.029
most legendary waterway in the world. It originates
somewhere roughly here, potentially in Uganda

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.660
or Burundi, but its tributaries are so convoluted
that no one knows for sure where its true

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.139
source is. It starts in earnest, though, here,
on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria, and

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:38.449
snakes northward through the rest of Uganda
and South Sudan before entering Sudan and

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.960
reaching its capital of Khartoum. This stretch
from Lake Victoria to Khartoum is considered

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.620
the White Nile and, in Khartoum, it connects
with the Blue Nile to become the Nile proper.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.679
This other tributary starts at Lake Tana in
Ethiopia and, while it’s the shorter and

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.260
potentially less well known of the two, its
actually far larger than the White Nile as

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.119
it carries 85% of the water that flows through
the Nile itself.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.130
Of course, 100% of this immense river ends
up passing through Egypt. Now, while these

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.960
may be their legal borders, for all intents
and purposes, Egypt is not this, but this.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.250
Some 95% of the country’s 98 million strong
population lives within the narrow strip of

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.369
land flanking the Nile River. Truly, Egypt
is the Nile and the Nile is Egypt. Almost

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.611
all of its power and influence, both modern
and ancient, is linked to this waterway. Of

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:39.750
course, much of what most people know this
country for is its past, rather than its present,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.649
as for nearly three millennia, Ancient Egypt
was one of the most powerful and advanced

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.479
civilizations on earth. Of course one can’t
link the success of any society to a single

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.600
factor, but it’s undeniable that at the
time of the height of Ancient Egypt’s reign,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.619
agricultural prowess was directly linked to
societal advancement. You could only develop

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.569
new technology if you could produce enough
food to feed the thinkers, and Egypt could

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.009
thanks to the Nile. Every year, in August
and September, the river would flood over

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.480
its banks and then, in October, it would recede,
leaving the floodplains well watered and fertilized,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.810
and allowing for a very productive year of
agriculture.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.879
Upstream, while its stories might not be as
frequently included in the high school history

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.930
books, what is now Sudan benefited from a
similar effect. The Kingdom of Kush, in particular,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.459
became an advanced society alongside the Nile,
upstream from modern day Egypt, and still

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.590
to this day, much of the country’s population
is concentrated in a narrow green zone along

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.730
the Nile. That’s mostly to say, Egypt and
Sudan have benefited through history from

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.409
this river in a largely similar way, but then
there’s the outlier: Ethiopia.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.510
Now, comparing the satellite images of Egypt
and Sudan to that of Ethiopia, there’s a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.769
pretty clear difference—Ethiopia is green.
Save for the coast, most of Egypt receives

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.050
less than ten millimeters of rain per year,
on average. This is also the case for much

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.420
of Sudan, but then, in the south, the weather
gets a little wetter, the land becomes a bit

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.480
greener, and dependence on the Nile lowers.
Of course, further upstream, in the Ethiopian

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.250
Highlands, dependence on this river for water
is nearly nonexistent. Certain areas receive

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.610
close to 80 inches or 200 centimeters of rain
per year, which, in comparison, is four times

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.940
that of London. These immense rains, in fact,
end up in the Nile itself, feeding most of

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.110
its flow, and eventually reach Sudan, Egypt,
and the Mediterranean Ocean.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.030
At least that was the case until the early
1900s. At that time, colonial powers and industrialists

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.580
sought not only to use the river, but to control
and fundamentally reshape it. This began in

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.329
1902 with the opening of the Aswan Low Dam,
then continued in the 1910s and 20s with the

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.110
development of the single largest irrigation
system in the world in Sudan, and as time

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.560
went on, the flow of the Nile became less
and less natural. With increasingly large

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.379
dams and irrigation projects, it slowly became
clear that this was all, more and more, a

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.410
zero sum game. It became clear that the flow
of the river was, indeed, finite.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.450
Therefore, they needed treaties. In 1929,
the British, representing Sudan and a few

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.960
other upstream countries, reached an agreement
with Egypt that, in exchange for a number

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.500
of smaller concessions, gave the country unconditional
veto power over upstream projects that it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.540
believed would reduce the amount of water
to reach them. This was followed up in 1959

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.580
with another agreement that gave Egypt the
rights to 66% of the river’s flow, Sudan

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.230
22%, and the rest was considered to be lost
to evaporation. Through time, these and other

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.110
agreements created a system where Egypt, with
the help of Sudan, was, on paper, the master

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.620
of the entire river, even beyond their borders,
despite their geographic position at the very

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.580
end of it. Except, the one country that was
never party to any of these agreements was

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.750
Ethiopia—where most of the water originates.
Still, Egypt has maintained that the Treaties

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.500
of 1929 and 1959 are binding agreements, underscored
by their historic use of the river, regardless

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.740
of who was at the table or who represented
the upstream states under colonial rule when

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.430
they were signed. They believe that they have
a say in water projects upstream, outside

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.190
their borders, insofar as the river maintains
the same rate of flow once it reaches Egypt.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.050
This remained a nominal issue for most of
the twentieth century, but it all changed

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.800
once&nbsp;Ethiopia had centralized enough power,
political will, and money to start to reshape

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.740
the Nile.
It all comes down to development. You see,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.820
while Egypt’s historic development was thanks
to the water of the Nile, it's now proving

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.030
to be a barrier. 97% of the country’s freshwater
comes from this river and, while Egypt's population

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.010
has grown, the Nile has, effectively, shrunk.
Therefore, annual water supply per capita

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.980
in the country has halved since 1970, even
as the country’s economy has further developed.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.750
The UN considers any country with under 1,000
cubic meters of water per person per year

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:30.660
as “water scarce.” Egypt has just 570.
It is now, more than ever, held back by water—for

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.750
example, it has to import around half of its
food, at huge cost to both its people and

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.320
the government, which subsidizes food. While
the Nile may have been more than enough when

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.850
Egypt’s population was two or three or four
million, thousands of years ago, it now is

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.910
far from that as they’re pushing up against
a population of 100 million.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.260
Ethiopia, meanwhile, does have significant
issues with food security, but not exactly

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.390
because they don’t have enough water. As
most people there live from harvest to harvest,

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:07.130
they’re prone to food shortages from a bad
year. The semi-regular famines that ensue

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.240
are dramatic, but the country has managed
to develop despite them. Since 2004, Ethiopia’s

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:21.020
GDP has grown about 10% per year, which is
immense. In fact, between 2013 and 2018, it

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.710
became the fastest growing economy in the
world, which is especially impressive given

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.940
its large size. Much of this growth has been
fueled by one thing: infrastructure investment.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.230
They’ve built a new railway to Djibouti,
opened East Africa’s first light rail system

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.130
in Addis Ababa, and are planning the construction
of Africa’s largest airport, however, the

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:50.460
story of Ethiopian infrastructure development
is most defined by just one, single project:

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:56.630
the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.
Located in the north-west of the country,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.160
this dam, once completed, will house the 8th
largest hydroelectric power facility in the

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.340
world, it will be nearly three times larger
than the next largest on the African continent,

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.990
and the reservoir behind it will be able to
hold more water than the entire Blue Nile

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:18.720
itself. It will be able to produce, in a year,
nearly 16,000 GWh of electricity. With that,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.590
it could fulfill the power needs of 234 million
Ethiopians. While that would be noteworthy

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.860
on its own, it’s even more so considering
that the population of Ethiopia is only about

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:38.560
109 million. This project, in one fell swoop,
will give the country a major power surplus.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:46.170
That is exciting for Ethiopia for two reasons.
First, it should have a multiplier effect

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.430
for development. Not only does building and
operating the dam itself provide jobs, but

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.889
if this energy can make its way to rural areas
especially, it could make certain jobs, such

00:08:56.889 --> 00:09:01.800
as farming, more productive. According to
the Rocky Mountain Institute, there’s about

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.329
$4 billion in potential economic opportunity
just from electrifying small rural farms and

00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:12.750
making their processes more efficient, which
is the equivalent of about 5% of the country’s

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.769
GDP. Ethiopia has one of the lowest per capita
power consumption rates in the world—the

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:23.730
average American consumes as much power as
186 Ethiopians—and increasing that can and

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:29.800
will improve quality of life and increase
economic growth. In addition to that, though,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.769
having more power than they need means that
Ethiopia can become an energy exporter. The

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:40.350
country plans to sell power to neighboring
Sudan, which is also severely energy starved,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.779
and eventually Egypt, Djibouti, Uganda, and
Tanzania too. All in all, according to the

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:51.259
World Bank, Ethiopia could become the largest
power exporter in Africa—earning around

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:56.670
$1 billion a year.
For Ethiopia and Ethiopians, this project

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:03.019
is a physical manifestation of the country’s
stunning, inspiring rise, and, uniquely, it’s

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:08.949
truly their dam. Unlike most large infrastructure
project in the region, this one was largely

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:14.769
self-funded by taxes and bonds that everyday
Ethiopians bought. That means that a big chunk

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:20.339
of Ethiopian people are financially and emotionally
linked to it, and it’s one of the rare unifying

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:26.480
causes in a country defined by ethnic violence
and highly factional politics. To Ethiopians,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:33.769
the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a powerful
force for good. Downstream, though, perceptions

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:40.920
are very, very different.
In Egypt, this new dam is viewed as an existential

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:48.399
threat. It’s a single project that has the
potential to upend their entire way of life.

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:52.850
Ethiopia will have the ability to quite literally
flip a switch to control how much water gets

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.220
to Egypt, and therefore how many people in
the country are hungry or thirsty. While some

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.450
are concerned that Ethiopia will actually
do this and remove water from the river to

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.860
use for agriculture, that’s not likely considering
where the dam is—being so close to the border

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.509
with Sudan, this would require them to pump
water back upstream, which would be hugely

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:18.189
expensive and impractical. The more real threat
for Egypt is around what’s starting to happen

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:23.300
now—the filling of the reservoir.
You see, given that the reservoir behind the

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.889
dam—required to keep the flow consistent
even during drier seasons—can hold the contents

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:33.699
of the entire Blue Nile itself, the process
of filling it could have a significant impact

00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:38.639
on the flow rates of the river. While the
long-term process of electricity generation

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:42.699
won’t actually remove any water from the
river, as one must run it through the turbines,

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:47.779
the short-term process of filling the reservoir
will likely lead to a period of a few years

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:53.569
when, in Egypt, there’s less water for agriculture,
drinking, and generating electricity. The

00:11:53.569 --> 00:12:00.360
big question therefore is: how long will the
filling of the reservoir take? For Ethiopia,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.279
they want this to happen as fast as possible.
The sooner the reservoir is filled, the sooner

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:09.050
they can put all their turbines online, and
the sooner they’ll get a return on their

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:14.069
investment. For Egypt, though, they don’t
want this to happen at all, but if it does,

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:18.660
they at least want it to be filled as slow
as possible, ideally in periods of heavy rain

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.100
when there’s a surplus of water. In their
minds, it’s going to be easier to get through

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.019
a decade or so with slightly lower flows than
just two or three years with dramatically

00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:32.990
lower flows. Egypt is also worried about a
foreign power having such an immense amount

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:38.420
of control over them—this potentially permanently
gives Ethiopia the upper hand. If they don’t

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.439
get what they want from Egypt, they can just
turn off the tap.

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:48.420
Both Egypt and Ethiopia, meanwhile, seem to
think that this issue is worth escalating

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.910
tensions over, even though, to the external
observer, it’s clear that there is a mutually

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:59.370
beneficial solution. On the western side of
the continent, a quite similar situation exists

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.050
with the Senegal River. This waterway’s
flow originates in the mountains of Guinea

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.839
and, to a lesser extent, Mali—two fairly
rainy countries—and snakes westward to form

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:14.079
the border between Senegal and Mauritania—two
rather dry countries. Recognizing that all

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:19.310
four countries rely on this river, but for
different reasons, they formed an organization,

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.870
the Senegal River Basin Development Authority,
to jointly manage the waterway for the mutual

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:30.040
benefit of all. This organization has crafted
multinational agreements to ensure that the

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.529
downstream, drier countries have the water
they need to ensure food security, while also

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:40.290
ensuring that the upstream countries can benefit
from cheap, clean power. They built a hydroelectric

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.720
dam in Mali which shares its power jointly
with Mauritania and Senegal, and then another

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.110
dam near the coast to prevent saltwater from
making its way upstream, and to irrigate farmland

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:54.759
in Mauritania and Senegal. All in all, they
treat the river as a multinational asset,

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:59.050
they recognize the dependence of downstream
populations on it, and they ensure that any

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:04.149
development upstream is to the mutual benefit
of all member states.

00:14:04.149 --> 00:14:10.060
This can also be the case for the Nile. The
Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam can benefit

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.319
Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, such as through
managing the flow to prevent floods, reduce

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:20.379
the impact of droughts, and increase productivity
of all countries’ dams, but only if they

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:26.949
work together. The reality right now, though,
is that Egypt, Ethiopia, and the other stakeholders

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:32.749
are incredibly far from this goal. Egypt maintains
a rhetoric that predicts, “inevitable conflict”

00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:37.149
if their demand are not met, while Ethiopia
has reportedly been preparing for the prospect

00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:43.209
of this by installing anti-aircraft batteries
around the dam. Egypt has long been the political

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:47.930
master of the Nile, largely because it’s
historically been the dominant economy along

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:53.089
the Nile, and so it seemingly can’t accept
a future where that is no longer the case.

00:14:53.089 --> 00:14:58.930
Ethiopia has always been the natural, geographic
master of the waterway, but it is only just

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:04.740
now coming to realize that. Without experience
in multinational cooperation over the river,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:10.420
it can’t seem to accept much less than full
control. There are really only two futures

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.139
with this river: either Ethiopia and Egypt
come to cooperate, and then turn the Nile

00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:20.559
into an economic engine for the entire region,
or they don’t, and fall further into a conflict

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:26.379
which will hold them both back. This entire
region could have a bright future, but to

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:31.430
get on the path towards that, they need to
focus on the Nile as a tool for unification,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.809
rather than division. They need to ignore
the political relics of the region’s colonial

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:41.929
past, and forge their own future based on
the realities of today. Once they do so, the

00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:46.240
Nile could not only maintain its status as
one of the most legendary waterways in the

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.690
world, but it could regain its position as
one of the most economically influential ones,

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:58.839
just as it was many millennia ago.
As I get ready for a winter with much more

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:03.889
time at home, one thing I’m doing is trying
to find more passions I can pursue while indoors,

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:08.079
and one of the ways I’m doing this is with
Skillshare. Of course they can help you get

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:12.689
ahead at work or school with all their classes
on hard skills like graphic design, but I

00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:17.490
really want to highlight how they can also
help you have fun on your own. Two classes

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:21.760
that are a great example of this is the one
on Remixing Dance Music and the one on live

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.189
DJing. The first helps you learn a skill that
you can very much do at home, then the second

00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:30.339
sets you up to use these skills in the hopefully
not so distant future when things like live

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:35.209
DJing can happen again. Of course, even if
you don’t think DJing or music production

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:39.689
will be your passion, with the thousands of
really high quality classes they have, there’s

00:16:39.689 --> 00:16:44.670
surely one that will kick start something
to captivate you over the next few months.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.660
Whether you want to become a music producer,
a YouTuber, a musician, an illustrator, an

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.480
artist, or anything, Skillshare is the place
to start, and it’s at no risk to you assuming

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.220
you become one of the first 1,000 to go to
the link in the description, as you’ll get

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.059
two months of learning on Skillshare for free,
and you’ll be supporting Wendover Productions

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:02.439
while you’re at it.
