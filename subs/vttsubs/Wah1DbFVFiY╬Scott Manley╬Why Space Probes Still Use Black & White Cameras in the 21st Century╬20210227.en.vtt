00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
now these photodiodes are not color
 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.030 align:start position:0%
now these photodiodes are not color

so<00:01:39.600><c> what</c><00:01:39.759><c> you'll</c><00:01:39.920><c> then</c><00:01:40.159><c> do</c><00:01:40.400><c> is</c><00:01:40.479><c> you'll</c><00:01:40.720><c> have</c>

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 align:start position:0%
so what you'll then do is you'll have
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.510 align:start position:0%
so what you'll then do is you'll have

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
that mean that say only red gets through
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.109 align:start position:0%
that mean that say only red gets through
so<00:01:45.759><c> you'll</c><00:01:45.920><c> get</c><00:01:46.159><c> red</c><00:01:46.479><c> pixels</c>

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
so you'll get red pixels
 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.789 align:start position:0%
so you'll get red pixels

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
science cameras those use a completely
 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.430 align:start position:0%
science cameras those use a completely

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
different system
 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.310 align:start position:0%
different system
you<00:04:39.600><c> see</c><00:04:40.240><c> yeah</c><00:04:40.800><c> if</c><00:04:40.880><c> you're</c><00:04:41.120><c> taking</c><00:04:41.520><c> images</c><00:04:42.080><c> of</c>

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
you see yeah if you're taking images of
 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
you see yeah if you're taking images of
stuff<00:04:42.639><c> maybe</c><00:04:42.960><c> you</c><00:04:43.120><c> want</c><00:04:43.280><c> to</c><00:04:43.440><c> have</c><00:04:43.680><c> that</c><00:04:43.919><c> high</c>

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
stuff maybe you want to have that high
 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.749 align:start position:0%
stuff maybe you want to have that high
signal<00:04:44.560><c> to</c><00:04:44.800><c> noise</c>

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.550 align:start position:0%
signal to noise
um<00:04:46.720><c> but</c><00:04:46.880><c> yeah</c><00:04:47.120><c> for</c><00:04:47.280><c> their</c><00:04:47.440><c> size</c><00:04:47.759><c> cameras</c><00:04:48.400><c> what</c>

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
um but yeah for their size cameras what
 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.909 align:start position:0%
um but yeah for their size cameras what
they<00:04:48.720><c> do</c><00:04:48.960><c> is</c><00:04:49.040><c> they</c><00:04:49.199><c> use</c>

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
they do is they use
 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.790 align:start position:0%
they do is they use
global<00:04:50.400><c> filters</c><00:04:51.280><c> so</c><00:04:51.440><c> they</c><00:04:51.600><c> have</c><00:04:51.919><c> a</c><00:04:52.240><c> wheel</c><00:04:52.560><c> that</c>

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
global filters so they have a wheel that
 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.990 align:start position:0%
global filters so they have a wheel that
lets<00:04:53.120><c> them</c><00:04:53.360><c> select</c>

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
lets them select
 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.230 align:start position:0%
lets them select
different<00:04:54.400><c> color</c><00:04:54.720><c> filters</c><00:04:55.440><c> and</c><00:04:55.600><c> apply</c><00:04:56.080><c> that</c>

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
different color filters and apply that
 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.510 align:start position:0%
different color filters and apply that
to<00:04:56.400><c> the</c><00:04:56.479><c> whole</c><00:04:56.800><c> sensor</c>

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the whole sensor
 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.749 align:start position:0%
to the whole sensor
so<00:04:57.680><c> they</c><00:04:57.840><c> will</c><00:04:58.000><c> select</c><00:04:58.320><c> the</c><00:04:58.400><c> reds</c><00:04:59.120><c> filter</c><00:04:59.520><c> take</c>

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
so they will select the reds filter take
 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.110 align:start position:0%
so they will select the reds filter take
a<00:04:59.840><c> picture</c><00:05:00.479><c> green</c>

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
a picture green
 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.189 align:start position:0%
a picture green
take<00:05:01.360><c> a</c><00:05:01.440><c> picture</c><00:05:01.840><c> blue</c><00:05:02.400><c> take</c><00:05:02.639><c> a</c><00:05:02.720><c> picture</c><00:05:03.120><c> and</c>

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
take a picture blue take a picture and
 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.670 align:start position:0%
take a picture blue take a picture and
then<00:05:04.080><c> merge</c><00:05:04.400><c> those</c><00:05:04.639><c> all</c><00:05:04.880><c> together</c>

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
then merge those all together
 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.310 align:start position:0%
then merge those all together
into<00:05:06.000><c> one</c><00:05:06.639><c> higher</c><00:05:07.039><c> quality</c><00:05:07.520><c> image</c><00:05:07.840><c> this</c><00:05:08.080><c> is</c>

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
into one higher quality image this is
 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.189 align:start position:0%
into one higher quality image this is
great

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%

and<00:12:33.760><c> simple</c>

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
and simple
 

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
and simple
so<00:12:34.639><c> instead</c><00:12:35.040><c> of</c><00:12:35.120><c> having</c><00:12:35.839><c> three</c><00:12:36.160><c> separate</c><00:12:36.720><c> ccds</c>

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
so instead of having three separate ccds
 

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.069 align:start position:0%
so instead of having three separate ccds
for

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%

different wavelengths what they did was
 

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.430 align:start position:0%
different wavelengths what they did was
they<00:12:39.839><c> got</c><00:12:40.079><c> a</c><00:12:40.320><c> monochrome</c>

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
they got a monochrome
 

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.310 align:start position:0%
they got a monochrome
ccd<00:12:42.560><c> and</c><00:12:42.880><c> they</c><00:12:43.040><c> just</c><00:12:43.279><c> put</c><00:12:43.519><c> different</c><00:12:43.920><c> filter</c>

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%

bands<00:12:44.639><c> over</c><00:12:44.800><c> it</c><00:12:44.880><c> so</c><00:12:45.040><c> there's</c><00:12:45.200><c> one</c><00:12:45.440><c> section</c>

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
infrared methane bands and because
 

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.870 align:start position:0%
infrared methane bands and because
they<00:12:52.800><c> can</c><00:12:53.040><c> move</c><00:12:53.360><c> the</c><00:12:53.519><c> data</c><00:12:53.920><c> around</c><00:12:54.560><c> while</c>

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
they can move the data around while
 

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.150 align:start position:0%
they can move the data around while

they're taking the photo
 

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.150 align:start position:0%
they're taking the photo
they<00:12:56.320><c> can</c><00:12:56.560><c> read</c><00:12:56.800><c> this</c><00:12:57.040><c> out</c><00:12:57.279><c> they</c><00:12:57.440><c> can</c><00:12:57.600><c> get</c><00:12:57.839><c> good</c>

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
they can read this out they can get good
 

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.190 align:start position:0%
they can read this out they can get good
images

00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%

and<00:12:59.600><c> this</c><00:12:59.839><c> is</c><00:13:00.240><c> it's</c><00:13:00.560><c> it's</c><00:13:00.800><c> great</c><00:13:01.120><c> because</c><00:13:01.440><c> of</c>

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
and this is it's it's great because of
 

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.750 align:start position:0%
and this is it's it's great because of
course<00:13:01.839><c> it</c><00:13:01.920><c> made</c><00:13:02.160><c> a</c><00:13:02.240><c> very</c><00:13:02.480><c> simple</c><00:13:02.800><c> camera</c><00:13:03.360><c> and</c>

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
course it made a very simple camera and
 

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.790 align:start position:0%
course it made a very simple camera and
it<00:13:04.000><c> operates</c><00:13:04.480><c> by</c><00:13:04.639><c> this</c><00:13:04.880><c> sort</c><00:13:05.120><c> of</c><00:13:05.200><c> cool</c><00:13:05.519><c> method</c>

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
it operates by this sort of cool method
 

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.949 align:start position:0%
it operates by this sort of cool method
so<00:13:06.959><c> i</c><00:13:07.040><c> guess</c><00:13:07.279><c> there's</c><00:13:07.839><c> one</c><00:13:08.160><c> final</c><00:13:08.560><c> thing</c><00:13:08.800><c> i</c>

00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
so i guess there's one final thing i
 

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:11.590 align:start position:0%
so i guess there's one final thing i
want<00:13:09.120><c> to</c><00:13:09.600><c> mention</c><00:13:10.079><c> is</c><00:13:10.240><c> that</c>

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
want to mention is that
 

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.629 align:start position:0%
want to mention is that
while<00:13:12.480><c> we</c><00:13:12.720><c> use</c><00:13:13.040><c> filters</c><00:13:13.600><c> to</c><00:13:13.680><c> get</c><00:13:14.000><c> red</c><00:13:14.320><c> green</c>

understand it so
 

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.509 align:start position:0%
understand it so
you<00:14:27.120><c> have</c><00:14:27.279><c> to</c><00:14:27.760><c> sort</c><00:14:28.000><c> of</c><00:14:28.160><c> turn</c><00:14:28.480><c> the</c><00:14:28.639><c> saturation</c>

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
you have to sort of turn the saturation
 

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:30.069 align:start position:0%
you have to sort of turn the saturation

up
 

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:32.069 align:start position:0%
up
and<00:14:30.240><c> that</c><00:14:30.480><c> means</c><00:14:30.800><c> you</c><00:14:30.959><c> get</c><00:14:31.199><c> more</c><00:14:31.600><c> signal</c><00:14:31.920><c> to</c>

00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
and that means you get more signal to

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
rather than less signal and that that's
 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.069 align:start position:0%
