00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:07.180
In December 1988, the leaders of China and
India met for the first time in nearly three

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.700
decades.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.769
The summit, which came after years of tense
border disputes, marked a turning point towards

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.370
friendlier relations.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.000
It was a time of hope.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.210
A China in transition.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.011
The range of possibilities, then, was wide,
and as the millennium came to a close, all

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.580
eyes were on the future of the continent.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.399
Amidst this optimism, China’s leader, Deng
Xiaoping, was skeptical.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.589
Despite what people have predicted, he cautioned,
there was no guarantee of an “Asian Century”.

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.839
Nevermind that he coined this term with hesitation,
the concept of an “Asian Century” would

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.539
soon take on a life of its own thanks to a
pattern of successes:

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.879
There was its relatively stronger performance
during the 2008 financial crisis,

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.420
the rapid growth of its “Four Tigers”
— Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.180
Taiwan,
And, of course, its explosive population and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.850
middle class.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.280
The basic premise was that, as Asia’s supply
chains integrated, its navies modernized,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.810
and trade dominated, this momentum would shift
the global center of gravity to The East.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.580
This notion — increasingly rephrased as
the “Rise of China” — escaped the fringes,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.880
entered the public consciousness, and was
thoroughly beat into all of our heads.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.929
Though likely to evoke different emotions,
its truthfulness was no longer controversial.

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.369
And then, no longer even interesting.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.420
A cliché.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.450
It’s not hard to see why.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.189
It contextualizes and attaches an enviable
momentousness to the present moment in time.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.650
In just two words, it neatly encapsulates
three centuries of history into that of Europe,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.869
America, and now, Asia.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.009
It seems to confirm what we already know,
in a way that suggests a larger trend, a narrative.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.769
At the same time, the nebulousness of what
it implies in concrete terms helped it evade

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.540
scrutiny and take on several independent meanings.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.700
After years, now, decades, of snowballing
predictions, optimistic models, bestselling

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.629
books, and emotive profiles designed to stoke
fear,

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.180
After 10,000 repetitions of the “Next Superpower”,
“Great Power Rivalry”, “China’s Grand

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.849
Strategy”, and “the Remaking of the World
Order”,

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.209
This once very simple idea has lost all sight
of reality.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.270
Like an overvalued startup, unchecked hyperbole
has driven its mental market share way out

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.880
of proportion.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.430
Beneath the mountains of wishful thinking
and grandiose predictions, there is merit,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.750
make no mistake.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.020
But it's time for a return to the fundamentals.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.129
A reckoning is long overdue.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.209
This is part one.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.129
We begin with the challenge to China’s supremacy
which underpins all others.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.250
One so insidious that it can only be solved,
by its very nature, over the course of decades.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.469
China will soon run out of people.

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:35.019
Sponsored by CuriosityStream and Nebula — where
you can watch the extended version of this

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.170
video.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.500
The absolute size of a population says a lot
about it.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.590
In the broadest of strokes, a big country
buys more things, giving it greater leverage.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.740
A tiny country, on the other hand, will more
likely rely on its neighbors.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.060
None of this is revolutionary.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.720
Which is to say there’s a good reason that,
when we talk about the ‘size’ of a country

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.340
in relation to its global significance, we’re
usually referring not to its square footage

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.210
but number of unique humans.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.120
The problem is that this number can also be
just as misleading as it is useful.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.860
When we compare population sizes, we mentally
take for granted a “typical nation”.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.720
We imagine, in other words, a similar proportion
of doctors, students, seniors, babies, and

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.420
plumbers — a reasonable shorthand for 90%
of conversations.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.310
This, however, is one of the remaining 10.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.390
Big, uniquely-consequential countries get
that way by adopting big, uniquely-consequential

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.710
policies, which means this single number just
won’t cut it.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.730
Ideally, we could visualize each individual
person, along with their education, occupation,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.850
and household size — things which, on average,
are known to affect their nation as a whole.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.580
But, in the absence of some revolution in
infographics, demographers have settled on

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.140
the next best thing, realizing that just one
number is remarkably accurate at predicting

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.030
your ‘contribution’ to the country — age.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.830
To show this, a “Population Pyramid” splits
a country into age cohorts.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.200
The longer the rectangle, the larger that
share of the population.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.180
The magic thing about age is that while sure,
the precise boundaries of things like ‘retirement’

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.530
and ‘adulthood’ may differ slightly between
countries, cohort behavior is tied to a set

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.710
of universal, biological facts which transcend
culture.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.340
Now, let’s add some detail to be more scientific,
and see what those looks like.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.090
I promise this is going somewhere.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.410
The first group are Seniors.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.090
With only their savings remaining, retirees
are low spenders, have little room for risk

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.790
and, thanks to their prudence, are of the
least interest to most marketers.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:09.030
The second group are the Producers — and,
economically, the only one that matters.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.930
During our thirties and forties, we reach
the peak of our earning potential, and put

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.300
all that money into stocks, retirement funds,
and expensive vacations.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.650
Another name for this group might be the “Greats”.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.270
Nearly all of the world’s Nobel Prize Winners
and great inventors were in this age bracket.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.810
The average age of top startup founders is
45.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.960
These individuals have an outsized influence
on the world, and thus, even a small change

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.870
in their size ripples throughout the nation.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.130
Next are the borrowers — students, fresh
graduates, and the drivers of demand for loans.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.900
Finally, and most useless of them all, are
babies — little money eating machines which

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.440
— conveniently — wait several decades
before offering anything of value.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.960
Alright, now that we’ve defined each cohort,
we can begin to see why their relative size

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.480
is where the magic happens.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.470
While there may not be a single most optimal
shape, there are certainly more and less desirable

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.290
shapes, economically speaking.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.500
And each kind of imbalance will lead to a
different kind of problem or benefit.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.000
To show this, let’s imagine the unrealistic
extremes:

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.610
If 90% of a country were babies, we’d have
a national babysitter shortage, lots of crying,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.650
and not much else.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:41.220
If 90% were aged between 30-60, it’d be
amazingly productive — punching well above

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.780
its weight class, with no dependents to care
for.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.940
But, fast forward 20 years and it would all
come crashing down as they all retired at

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:55.910
the same time and waited for social security
which there’d be no one left to pay for.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.150
Expect total social collapse.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:04.050
Now, none of this is to discount the role
of culture, political system, physical environment,

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.900
or any other factor, for that matter.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.150
All of these things play a role — but think
of them as a few of the necessary ingredients

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.180
— the egg, sugar, and butter to demography’s
flour.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.390
Without the ingredient of functional government,
you can’t bake the cookie.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:26.870
But no matter how effective the government,
how strong the military, or influential the

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:32.620
economy, none of it is sufficient if you’re
missing the final key ingredient: the right

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.289
population.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:39.229
Another way of saying this is that, by looking
only at the shape of a country’s population

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:44.250
— without any absolute numbers or extra
information— we can already get a sense

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.620
of its range of possible futures.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.550
We can tell, for example, that this super-fast-growing
country has a massive opportunity.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.240
If it industrializes fast enough, it could
harness this large working-age cohort with

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.900
few dependents, to modernize and raise the
standard of living.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:08.800
If those in power fail to manage that transition,
the larger population will only mean more

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.110
starvation, more disease, and less land.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.120
This is Nigeria.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:20.889
Likewise, we can conclude that this one has
just experienced decades of miraculous growth,

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:26.379
but will soon, and very quickly, age, shrinking
considerably in the process.

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:32.130
How the government responds will determine
whether this is merely disastrous or truly

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.170
catastrophic.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.740
This is China.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:42.199
Its past forty years of celebrated growth
— the basis for predictions of China’s

00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:48.350
rise, the source of general optimism, the
trend which many assume will continue — coincides

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:53.439
with this hump in the pyramid — which represents
tens of millions of extra people in their

00:09:53.439 --> 00:09:56.110
prime working years.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.730
Everything that made China what it is today
has relied on a large, young, and productive

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.730
workforce.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.959
Now, that workforce is about to succumb to
biology just as every other generation has

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:11.390
in every other country, ever.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.829
Graphs describing China tend to take this
shape, but demographers know better.

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:23.290
They know that this has only been a temporary,
transitional state on the road to industrialization.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.870
It even has a name.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.649
It’s called a “Demographic dividend”.

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:34.370
During this time, life expectancy is still
catching up, meaning there are few retirees.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:40.069
At the same time, fewer babies are being born
as women receive access to education.

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:45.310
For these few years — and only these few
years — the country in transition has all

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:52.720
the manpower in the world, which, when well-coordinated,
translates to exceptional economic growth.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.579
There’s a painful flipside, however.

00:10:56.579 --> 00:11:01.509
What looks like a ‘dividend’ will eventually
feel more like a loan.

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:06.759
The scary thing about retirement is that it
happens all at once.

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:12.310
While income tends to rise steadily throughout
your career, it doesn’t much fade away at

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.320
65.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.800
One day, you retire, and that day, your income
falls to 0.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.490
Which is to say, in a few years, these workers
will retire, moving the pyramid upward, and

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.720
leaving the country’s future to this shrinking
base.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.920
And it will happen all at once.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.320
Remember: This ‘little’ hump was behind
the last few decades of growth, and this ‘little’

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.689
dip represents its future.

00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:48.589
China’s working-age cohort grew from 58%
of the country in 1978 to 74% in 2010.

00:11:48.589 --> 00:11:53.501
But in less than twenty years, the UN predicts
that number will be roughly back where it

00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.610
was in ‘78.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.819
By then, China will have twice as many seniors
as children under 15.

00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:06.819
And at the end of this century, its total
population will be cut in half.

00:12:06.819 --> 00:12:11.050
You might think that, having worked during
this growth phase, China’s elders will be

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.319
well prepared for retirement.

00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:20.740
But its per capita wealth remains low, on
the level of Mexico, the Maldives, and Kazakhstan.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.759
That means this mass of retirees won’t just
contribute less to the economy, but will also

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:31.660
require immense financial support — the
kind China’s fractured pension and healthcare

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.220
system isn’t remotely prepared for.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.420
Put simply:
All of China’s recent progress has been

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.430
bought on credit, and it’s finally coming
time to repay.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:49.819
Now, why, you might ask, can’t Chinese people
simply have more babies?

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:54.269
If families were once larger, why can’t
they just return that way?

00:12:54.269 --> 00:13:00.050
Recall, however, that because of the 20-year
gap between a baby born today and its first

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:05.519
real contribution to society, the damage is
already done.

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:10.939
Demography plays out over the course of generations,
and today’s smaller baby cohort will mean

00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:15.290
even fewer babies when they reach adulthood.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:20.990
But fine, setting aside that this problem
can only be solved in a minimum of two decades

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:27.149
even if the solution were known and implemented
tomorrow, remember what we’re talking about.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:32.491
It’s easy to get lost in the language of
‘generations’ and ‘cohorts’ — demography

00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:38.959
can unfortunately be dehumanizing — and,
in the process, lose sight of what ‘fertility’

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:45.220
really means: the very complex decision of
adults to have children.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.319
Some of this choice is beyond the reach of
government.

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:53.649
Perceptions of parenthood, tradition, and
family are, first and foremost, formed based

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:56.769
on one’s own family.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:02.379
Unfortunately for China, the One-Child Policy
has set the cultural expectation firmly at

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:03.379
one.

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:07.510
And one just isn’t enough.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:12.670
Assuming it takes two people to make a baby,
together they need at least two just to replace

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.569
themselves, plus a small fraction more to
account for early deaths.

00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:22.199
That means a country needs a “Total Fertility
Rate” — the number of children the average

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:28.279
woman will have in her lifetime — of 2.1
— just to sustain its current population.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:34.269
China’s is currently 1.6 — if you believe
the government.

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:38.850
If you don’t believe the average Chinese
woman has 1.6 children in a country where

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:44.480
the vast majority were, until recently, only
allowed to have one, then you might be tempted

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.149
to believe someone like Yi Fuxian, a scientist
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:54.149
estimates the true number at 1.18.

00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:59.619
To get a better sense of just how hard this
problem is, think of fertility rate as an

00:14:59.619 --> 00:15:04.860
ungainly machine controlled by 100 different
unlabeled levers.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.670
Policymakers know of at least a few levers
that will predictably lower the TFR, but once

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.860
the machine has slowed, there’s neither
a clear way of getting it going again, nor

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.220
any proof that it’s even possible at the
scale necessary.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:25.249
There is, on the other hand, precedent for
these attempts failing, even by proud and

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:27.910
authoritarian Singapore.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:33.519
But before we pour salt on this demographic
wound, let’s be fair and start with the

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:34.519
positive…

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:39.860
For starters, Chinese workers are becoming
better educated, meaning it will take fewer

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.029
workers to make the same economic contribution.

00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:49.339
And to the extent that automation replaces
labor, the need for a strong working-age population

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:55.249
may diminish, leaving China with the same
old challenges faced by other automated countries.

00:15:55.249 --> 00:16:01.079
It would also be unfair not to mention that
China’s problem stems from a few strictly

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:07.540
good developments: Women are choosing to have
fewer babies because they can, and seniors

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.810
are living longer thanks to a rise in standards
of living.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:17.129
These richer, longer, more fulfilling lives
have value on their own.

00:16:17.129 --> 00:16:19.809
Now, a summary of the bad news:

00:16:19.809 --> 00:16:25.980
* There’s a lack of reliable data and reporting,
which means no one truly knows how bad the

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.720
problem is.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:33.029
* The simultaneous rising life expectancy
means seniors will burden the economy for

00:16:33.029 --> 00:16:34.829
longer than ever.

00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:40.740
* China’s preference for male babies means
that between 2020 and 2060, there will be

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.750
roughly 3 single men for every 2 single women.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:50.490
* There’s the impact of the Coronavirus
pandemic, whose slowing of fertility may simply

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:57.139
hasten the inevitable, or permanently make
things worse — both scenarios bad.

00:16:57.139 --> 00:17:02.339
* Compounding the problem is the government’s
unwillingness to accept blame and reverse

00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:03.339
course.

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:09.980
After 35 years of the One-Child Policy, there’s
a desperate need to justify its costly existence.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:16.300
As of 2015, most families are allowed only
two children, and even that change in policy

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.909
has had little effect.

00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:23.450
* Finally, there’s the slow and invisible
nature of the problem.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.710
Consider the last time you saw a news headline
about declining births.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.960
Like climate change, there will always be
a more ‘urgent’ crisis that takes precedence.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:39.640
And because the effects of a demographic crisis
are felt over years, not days, those who highlight

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.830
the problem will be labeled by many as melodramatic.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:50.210
In other words, the slowness of the problem
makes it harder, not easier, to mitigate.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.480
While these facts have been known for years,
only last year did we receive authoritative

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:02.420
confirmation, in China’s 2020 Census, which
tallied 14.65 million births the previous

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.210
year — the lowest level since 1961.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.430
With our fears confirmed, now, the question
turns to:

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.440
Just how bad will the fallout be?

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:20.330
Perhaps the closest comparison is the fate
of Japan — also once a fast-growing economy

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.800
hailed as the “next superpower” and also
aging.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.250
With a median age of 48.6, Japan is the 2nd
oldest place on earth.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:38.370
Today, its share of the world’s manufacturing
exports has fallen from 12.5% to just 5.2.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.700
Japan did not fade into global irrelevance.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.370
It’s still a great power.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:51.890
But it never fulfilled what once seemed certain:
its rise to rival the U.S. as a superpower.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.290
And it never will.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:19:00.420
China’s ‘repayment’ of its demographic
loan will, at a minimum, place a severe strain

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.810
on its economy.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:08.570
With this strain will likely come a sobering
reassessment of its rise.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.790
Demography alone cannot predict the future,
and it would be foolish to forecast specific

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.890
social or political implications, but one
cannot help but wonder:

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:25.510
What drastic things does a nation do in this
limited window of time before its power wanes?

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.250
What does a generation of young people think
when they face far more challenging prospects

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.610
than did their parents?

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:38.810
And what culture develops in the absence of
any hope for marriage among 34 million men?

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:44.560
Deng Xiaoping may have indeed been right when
he cautioned the “Asian Century” may never

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.310
arrive.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.400
And we’re just getting started.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.690
China’s demographic crisis will soon seep
into its single biggest driver of growth:

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.650
the illusive and out-of-control property market.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:03.060
Housing is China’s next reckoning — a
topic that deserves its own video — next

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.310
time, in Part 2.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:11.250
In the meantime, you may have noticed that
the U.S. also has a TFR of 1.7 — well below

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.950
replacement level.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.450
Does this mean it, too, is in for a similar
fall?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:35.320
and special videos, like Mustard’s beautifully-rendered
tribute to the F-117 Nighthawk, Rene Ritchie’s

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:41.110
mini-documentary looking back at the introduction
of the iPhone, and much, much more.
