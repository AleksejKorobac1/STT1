00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.410
- The following is a
conversation with Eric Weinstein.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.340
He's a mathematician, economist,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.760
physicist and the managing
director of Thiel Capital.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.960
He coined the term and you could say,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.410
is the founder of the
Intellectual Dark Web,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.370
which is a loosely assembled
group of public intellectuals

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.980
that includes Sam Harris,
Jordan Peterson, Steven Pinker,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.990
Joe Rogan, Michael
Shermer and a few others.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.240
This conversation is part of
the artificial intelligence

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.270
podcast at MIT and Beyond.

on Twitter @lexfridman,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.420
spelled F-R-I-D.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.463
And now, here's my conversation
with Eric Weinstein.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.360
- Are you nervous about this?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.260
- Scared shitless.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.470
- Okay, (speaking foreign language).

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.550
- You mention Kung Fu Panda as
one of your favorite movies.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.040
It has the usual profound
master student dynamic going on,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.240
so who has been a teacher
that significantly influenced

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.930
the direction of your
thinking and life's work?

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.700
So, if you're the Kung Fu
Panda, who was your Shifu?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.533
- Oh, well that's interesting,

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.160
because I didn't see Shifu
as being the teacher.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.830
- Who was the teacher?

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.070
- Oogway, Master Oogway, the turtle.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.170
- Oh, the turtle, right.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.840
- They only meet twice in the entire film

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.003
and the first conversation
sort of doesn't count.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.410
So, they magic of the
film, in fact, it's point

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
is that the teaching that
really matters is transferred

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.090
during a single conversation
and it's very brief.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.700
And so, who played that role in my life?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700
I would say either my
grandfather, Harry Rubin

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.053
and his wife Sophie Rubin,
my grandmother or Tom Lehrer.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.283
- Tom Lehrer?
- Yeah.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.163
- In which way?

00:01:58.163 --> 00:02:01.430
- If you give a child Tom Lehrer records,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.250
what you do is you destroy their ability

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.253
to be taken over by later malware,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.090
and it's so irreverent, so
witty, so clever, so obscene,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.780
that it destroys the ability

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.360
to lead a normal life for many people.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.360
So if I meet somebody who's
usually really shifted

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.160
from any kind of neuro
typical presentation,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.710
I'll often ask them,
are you a Tom Lehrer fan

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.160
and the odds that they will
respond are quite high.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.590
- Now Tom Lehrer is Poisoning
Pigeons in the Park,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.210
Tom Lehrer?
- That's very interesting.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.440
There are a small number
of Tom Lehrer songs

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.840
that broke into the general population.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.260
Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.683
the Element Song and
perhaps the Vatican Rag.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.500
So, when you meet somebody
who knows those songs,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.610
but doesn't know--

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.680
- Oh, you're judging me
right now, aren't you?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.060
- Harshly.
- Okay.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.470
- No, but you're Russian, so.
- Yes.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.330
- Undoubtedly you know
Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.960
That song.
- Yes, yeah, yup.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.840
- So that was a song about plagiarism

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.560
that was in fact plagiarized,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.860
which most people don't
know, from Danny Kaye.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.680
Where Danny Kaye did a song called

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.000
Stanislavsky of the musky arts.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.300
And, so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.970
of plagiarizing a song and
making it about plagiarism,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.540
and then making it about
this mathematician,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.830
who worked in Non-Euclidean geometry.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.570
That was like giving heroin to a child.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.770
It was extremely addictive and eventually

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.570
led me to a lot of different places.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.570
One of which may have
been PhD in mathematics.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.610
- And he was also at least
a lecturer in mathematics,

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.720
I believe at Harvard, something like that?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.750
- Yeah, I just had
dinner with him, in fact.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.480
When my son turned 13, we didn't tell him,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.770
but his Bar mitzvah present was dinner

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.370
with his hero, Tom Lehrer,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.810
and Tom Lehrer was 88
years old, sharp as a tack,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.350
irreverent and funny as
hell and just, you know,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.610
there are very few people in this world

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.700
that you have to meet
while they're still here

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.290
and that was definitely
one for our family.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.290
- So that wit is a
reflection of intelligence

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.800
in some kind of deep way.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.770
Like where that would be a good test

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.230
of intelligence whether
you're a Tom Lehrer fan.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.760
So, what do you think that is about wit?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.220
About that kind of humor,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.120
ability to see the absurdity in existence?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.640
Do you think that's connected
to intelligence or are we just

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.720
two Jews on a mic that
appreciate that kind of humor.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.690
- No, I think that it's absolutely

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.970
connected to intelligence.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.890
You can see it, there's a
place where Tom Lehrer decides

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.840
that he's going to lampoon
Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.870
and he's going to out
due Gilbert with clever,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.940
meaningless wordplay and he has,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.030
I forget the, well let's see.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.980
He's doing Clementine as if
Gilbert and Sullivan wrote it

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.410
and he says that I missed her,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.720
depressed her young sister named Esther.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.160
This mister to pester she'd tried.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.700
A pestering sister's a festering blister

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.510
you're best to resist her, say I!

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.040
The sister persisted, the mister resisted,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.253
I kissed her, all loyalty slipped.

00:05:06.253 --> 00:05:08.440
When she said I could have
her her sister's cadaver

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.600
must surely have turned in its crypt.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.870
That's so dense.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.810
It's so insane.
- Yeah.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.530
- That that's clearly intelligence because

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.540
it's hard to construct
something like that.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.540
If I look at my favorite
Tom Lehrer lyric, you know,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.930
there's a perfectly absurd one which is,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.820
once all the German's
were warlike and mean,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.240
but that couldn't happen again.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.040
We taught them a lesson in 1918

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.150
and they've hardly bothered us since then.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.440
- Right.
- That is a different

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.870
kind of intelligence.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.810
You know, you're taking
something that is so horrific

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.210
and you're sort of making
it palatable and funny,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.120
and demonstrating also just your humanity.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.850
I mean, I think the thing that
came through as Tom Lehrer

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.240
wrote all of these
terrible, horrible lines,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.060
was just what a sensitive
and beautiful soul he was,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.883
who was channeling pain through
humor and through grace.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.960
- I've seen throughout
Europe, throughout Russia,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.200
the same kind of humor emerged

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.240
from the generation of World War II.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.240
It seemed like that humor
is required to somehow deal

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.010
with the pain and the suffering
of that that war created.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.940
- Well, you do need the environment

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.750
to create the broad Slavic soul.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.530
I don't think that many
Americans really appreciate

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.900
Russian humor, how you had
to joke during the time

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.870
of let's say, Article 58 under Stalin.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.660
You had to be very, very careful.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.540
You know, the concept of a
Russian satirical magazine,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.410
like Krokodil, doesn't make sense.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.770
So you have this cross
cultural problem that there

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.140
are certain areas of human
experience that it would

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.470
be better to know nothing
about and quite unfortunately,

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.670
eastern Europe knows a
great deal about them,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.033
which makes the songs of
Vladimir Voevodsky so potent.

00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:04.290
You know, the prose of
Pushkin, whatever it is.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.100
You have to appreciate the
depth of the Eastern European

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.740
experience and I would think
that perhaps Americans knew

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.590
something like this around
the time of the Civil War

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.700
or maybe under slavery and Jim Crow

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.700
or even the harsh tyranny of the coal

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.293
and steel employers during the labor wars.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.040
But in general I would say,
it's hard for us to understand

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.080
and imagine the collective culture,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.470
unless we have the system
of selective pressures,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.563
that for example, Russians
were subjected to.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.750
- Yeah, so if there's one good
thing that comes outta war,

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.750
it's literature, art and humor and music.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.380
- Oh, I don't think so. I
think almost everything is good

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.040
about war except for
death and destruction.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.873
- Right.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.690
Without the death it would
bring the romance of it,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.523
the whole thing is nice but--

00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:05.057
- Well, this is why we're
always caught up in war.

00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:08.350
We have this very ambiguous
relationship to it,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.800
is that it makes life real
and pressing and meaningful,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.870
and at an unacceptable price

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.780
and the price has never been higher.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.253
- So to jump into AI a little bit,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.860
in one of the conversations
you had or one of the videos,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.980
you described that one of the
things AI systems can't do

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.930
and biological systems
can is self replicate

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.960
in the physical world.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960
- [Eric] Oh, no, no.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.040
- In the physical world.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.410
- Well, yes.

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.029
The physical robots can't self replicate,

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:46.900
but there's a very tricky point,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.570
which is that the only
thing that we've been able

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.720
to create that's really
complex that has an analog

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.340
of our reproductive system is software.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.880
- But, nevertheless,
software replicates itself,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.090
if we're speaking strictly
for the replication

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.110
is this kinda digital space.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.690
So let me, just to begin,
let me ask a question.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.410
Do you see a protective barrier or a gap

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.260
between the physical world
and the digital world?

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.440
- Let's not call it digital.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.753
Let's call it the logical world
versus the physical world.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.840
- Why logical?

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.170
- Well, because even though we had,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.423
let's say Einstein's brain preserved,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.850
it was meaningless to
us as a physical object

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.150
because we couldn't do anything with

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.580
what was stored in it at a logical level.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.450
And so, the idea that something
may be stored logically

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.450
and that it may be stored
physically, are not necessarily,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.740
we don't always benefit from synonymizing.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.150
I'm not suggesting that
there isn't a material basis

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.320
to the logical world,
but that it does warrant

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.080
identification with a separate layer that

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.080
need not invoke logic
gates and zeros and ones.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.420
- And, so connecting those two worlds,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.770
the logical world and the
physical world or maybe

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.650
just connecting to the logical
world inside our brain,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.650
Einstein's brain, you mention
the idea of outtelligence.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.500
- [Eric] Artificial outtelligence.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.690
- Artificial outtelligence.
- Yes, this is the only essay

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.800
that John Brockman every
invited me to write

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.045
that he refused to publish in Edge.

00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:25.560
(Lex chuckling)

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.790
- Why?

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.440
- Well, maybe it wasn't well
written, but I don't know.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.500
- The idea is quite compelling.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.230
It's quite unique and new, at
least from my stance point.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.310
Maybe you can explain it?

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.520
- Sure.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.620
What I was thinking about is
why it is that we're waiting

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.300
to be terrified by artificial
general intelligence.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.300
When in fact, artificial
life is terrifying

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.530
in and of itself and it's already here.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.820
So, in order to have a system
of selective pressures,

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.210
you need three distinct elements.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.350
You need variation within a population,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.473
you need heritability, and
you need differential success.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.000
So, what's really unique
and I've made this point,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I think elsewhere, about software,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.970
is that if you think about what humans

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.320
know how to build that's impressive.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.960
So, I always take a car
and I say does it have

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.520
an analog of each of the
physiological systems?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.880
Does it have a skeletal
structure, that's its frame.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.160
Does it have a neurological structure,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.590
it has an onboard computer.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.773
It has a digestive system.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.420
The one thing it doesn't have
is a reproductive system.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.950
But if you can call spawn on a process,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.250
effectively you do have
a reproductive system.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.720
And that means that you
can create something

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.380
with variation, heritability
and differential success.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.780
Now, the next step in
the chain of thinking

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.780
was where do we see inanimate
non intelligent life

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.373
outwitting intelligent life?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.150
And I have two favorite
systems and I try to stay

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.370
on them so that we don't get distracted.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.370
One of which is the Ophrys
orchid sub species or sub clave,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.853
I don't what to call it.

00:12:17.853 --> 00:12:20.290
- Is that a type of flower?
- Yeah, it's a type of flower

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.480
that mimics the female
of a pollinator species

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.580
in order to dupe the males
into engaging in what

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.610
is called pseudocopulation,
with the fake female,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.730
which is usually represented
by the lowest pedal,

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.450
and there's also a pheromone
component to fool the males

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.990
into thinking they have
a mating opportunity.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.090
But the flower doesn't have
to give up energy in the form

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.093
of nectar as a lure, because
it's tricking the males.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.300
The other system is a
particular species of muscle,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.600
lampsilis in the clear streams
of Missouri and it fools bass

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.900
into biting a fleshy lip that
contain its young and when

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.070
the bass see this fleshy
lip, which looks exactly like

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.880
a species of fish that
the bass like to eat,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.410
the young explode and clamp
onto the gills and parasitize

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.620
the bass and also use
the bass to redistribute

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.343
them as they eventually release.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.450
Both of these systems, you
have a highly intelligent dupe,

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.143
being fooled by a lower life form.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.530
And what is sculpting
these convincing lures?

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.160
It's the intelligence of previously

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.470
duped targets for these strategies.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.803
So when the target is smart
enough to avoid the strategy,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.680
those weaker mimics fall off,
they have terminal lines,

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:52.730
and only the better ones survive.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.610
So it's an arms race
between the target species

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.910
that is being parasitized,
getting smarter,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.220
and this other less intelligent

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.063
or non intelligent object
getting as if smarter.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.250
And so, what you see is,
is that artificial general

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.130
intelligence is not
needed to parasitize us.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:22.060
It's simply sufficient for
us to outwit ourselves,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.230
so you could have a program, let's say,

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.230
one of these Nigerian
scams that writes letters

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:33.230
and uses whoever sends it
Bitcoin to figure out which

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.800
aspects of the program should be kept,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.740
which should be varied and thrown away,

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.280
and you don't need it to
be in anyway intelligent

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.740
in order to have a really
nightmare scenario being

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.650
parasitized by something that
has no idea what it's doing.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.330
- So you phrased a few
concepts really eloquently,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.110
so let me try to, there's
a few directions this goes.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.910
So one, first of all, in the
way we write software today,

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:01.160
it's not common that we
allow it to self modify.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.850
- But we do have that ability now.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.261
- We have the ability.
- It's just not common.

00:15:05.261 --> 00:15:07.045
- I just isn't common.

00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:11.260
So your thought is that that is

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.147
a serious worry if there becomes--

00:15:15.295 --> 00:15:18.450
- But self modifying
code is available now.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.070
- So there's different types
of self modification right?

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.990
There's personalization,
you know your email app,

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.990
your Gmail is self modifying
to you after you login

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.320
or whatever, you can think of that way.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.240
But ultimately it's central,
all the information is

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.000
centralized, but you're
thinking of ideas where you're,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.110
this is a unique entity operating under

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.910
selective pressures and it changes--

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.810
- Well, you just, if you
think about the fact that our

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.640
immune systems don't know
what's coming at them next,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.750
but they have a small set
of spanning components,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.710
and if it's a sufficiently
expressive system in that any

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:07.710
shape or binding region can
be approximated with the Lego

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.670
that is present, then
you can have confidence

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.850
that you don't need to
know what's coming at you

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.010
because the combinatorics are sufficient

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.303
to reach any configuration needed.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.880
- So that's a beautiful, well
terrifying thing to worry

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.830
about because it's so within our reach.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.550
- Whenever I suggest
these things I do always

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.670
have a concern as to whether
or not I will bring them

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.930
into being by talking about them.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:41.930
- So there's this thing
from OpenAI next week,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.010
to talk to the founder of OpenAI,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.023
this idea that their text generation,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.140
the new stuff they have
for generating text is,

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.400
they didn't wanna bring it,
they didn't wanna release

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.520
it because they're about the--

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.910
- I'm delighted to hear that,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.670
but they're going to end up releasing.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.180
- Yes, that's the thing is
I think talking about it,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.270
well at least from my end,

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:09.643
I'm more a proponent of
technology preventing,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.050
so further innovation preventing

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.460
the detrimental effects of innovation.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.680
- Well we're in a, we're
sort of tumbling down

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.230
a hill at accelerating speed.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.525
So, whether or not we're proponents or--

00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:26.820
- It doesn't really matter.
- It may not matter.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.300
- But I.
- Well, may not.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.910
- Well, I do feel that there are people

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.920
who have held things back and you know,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.350
died poorer than they
might have otherwise been.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.450
We don't even know their names.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.110
I don't think that we should
discount the idea that having

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.270
the smartest people showing
off how smart they are by what

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.930
they've developed may
be a terminal process.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.420
I'm very mindful in particular
of a beautiful letter that

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.350
Edward Teller of all
people wrote to Leo Szilard

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.360
where Szilard was trying to
figure out how to control the

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.360
use of atomic weaponry at the
end of World War II and Teller

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.083
rather strangely, because many
of us view him as a monster,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.280
showed some very advanced
moral thinking talking about

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.420
the slim chance we have for survival

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.520
and that the only hope is
to make war unthinkable.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.140
I do think that not enough
of us feel in our gut,

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.570
what it is we are playing
with when we are working on

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.500
technical problems, and I
would recommend to anyone who

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.180
hasn't seen it, a movie called
A Bridge on the River Kwai,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.710
about I believe captured British POWs

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.000
who just in a desire to do a bridge well,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.110
end up over collaborating
with their Japanese captors.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.660
- Well, now you're making me question

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.273
the unrestricted open
discussion of ideas and AI.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.600
- I'm not saying I know the answer,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.870
I'm just saying that I
could make a decent case

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.860
for either our need to talk about this and

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.700
to become technologically
focused on containing it

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.347
or need to stop talking about
this and try to hope that

00:19:05.347 --> 00:19:08.610
the relatively small number
of highly adept individuals

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.120
who are looking at these
problems is small enough that

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.010
we should in fact be talking
about how to contain it.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.540
- Well, the way ideas, the
way innovation happens,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.320
what new ideas develop,
Newton with calculus.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.320
Whether if he was silent, the
idea would emerge elsewhere,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.750
well in case of Newton, of course,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.880
but you know, in case of
AI, how small is this set of

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.803
individuals out of which
such ideas would arise?

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.970
Is it in question--
- Well, the ideas of

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.710
the researchers we know and
those that we don't know.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.620
Who may live in countries
that don't wish us to know

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.200
what level they're currently
at and are very disciplined

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.520
in keeping these things to themselves.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.910
Of course, I will point out that there

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.910
is a religious school in
Kerala that developed something

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.510
very close to the calculus,
certainly in terms of infinite

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:05.510
series in, I guess religious prayer

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.360
and rhyme and prose.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.790
So, you know, it's not
that Newton had any ability

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.460
to hold that back and
I don't really believe

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.670
that we have an ability to hold back.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.980
I do think that we could change
the proportion of the time

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.380
we spend worrying about
the effects of what

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.840
if we are successful, rather
than simply trying to succeed

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.300
and hope that we'll be able
to contain things later.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.190
- Beautifully put.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.593
So, on the idea of
outtelligence, what form,

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.550
treading cautiously 'cause we've agreed

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.590
as we tumbled down the hill.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.090
What form--
- Can't stop ourselves can we?

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.923
- We cannot.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.500
What form do you see it taking?

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.500
So one example, Facebook,
Google, do want to,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.240
I don't know a better
word, you want to influence

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.820
users to behave a certain way.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.630
And so that's one kind of
example of outtelligence,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.520
is systems perhaps modifying the behavior

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.070
of these intelligent human beings in order

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.660
to sell more product of different kind.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.910
But do you see other examples
of this actually emerging in?

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.830
- Just take any parasitic
system, you know?

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.820
Make sure that there's some
way in which that there's

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.630
differential success,
heritability and variation,

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.450
and those are the magic ingredients.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.300
And if you really wanted to
build a nightmare machine,

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.050
make sure that the system
that expresses the variability

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:39.030
has a spanning set, so that it
can learn to arbitrary levels

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.800
by making it sufficiently expressive.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.170
That's your nightmare.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.300
- So, it's your nightmare,
but it could also be,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.240
it's a really powerful
mechanism by which to create,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.290
well, powerful systems.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.130
So, are you more worried
about the negative direction

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.040
that might go versus the positive?

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.760
So, you said parasitic, but
that doesn't necessarily

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.110
need to be what the
system converges towards.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.639
It could be, what is it, symbiotic--

00:22:06.639 --> 00:22:10.640
- Well, parasitism, the
dividing line between parasitism

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.630
and symbiosis is not so clear.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.120
- [Lex] That's what they
tell me about marriage.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.360
I'm still single, so I don't know.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.813
- Well, yeah I do.

00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:23.870
Would could go into that
too, but um. (Lex laughing)

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.960
No, I think we have to
appreciate, you know,

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.540
are you infected by your own mitochondria?

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.373
- Right.

00:22:35.507 --> 00:22:36.990
Yeah.
- Right, so in marriage

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.930
you fear the loss of independence,

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.680
but even though the American
therapeutic community

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.170
may be very concerned about co-dependence,

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.110
what's to say that co-dependence
isn't what's necessary

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:52.170
to have a stable relationship
in which to raise children

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.850
who are maximally K-selected and require

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.040
incredible amounts of care,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.640
because you have to wait 13 years before

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.450
there's any reproductive
payout and most of us

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.790
don't want our 13 year olds having kids.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.590
That's a very tricky situation to analyze.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:09.590
I would say that predators
and parasites drive much

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.010
of our evolution and I don't know whether

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.950
to be angry at them or thank them.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.620
- Well, ultimately, I mean,
nobody knows the meaning of life

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.250
or what even happiness is,
but there is some metrics--

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.270
- Oh, they didn't tell you?
- They didn't, they didn't.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.620
That's why all the poetry
and books are bought.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.710
You know, there are
some metrics under which

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.290
you can kinda measure how good it is that

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.940
these AI systems are roaming about.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.940
So, you're more nervous
about software than you

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.990
are optimistic about ideas
of self replicating larceny?

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.563
- I don't think we've
really felt where we are.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.380
You know, occasionally we get a wake up.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:58.080
9/11 was so anomalous
compared to everything else

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.290
we've experienced on American
soil, that it came to us

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.980
as a complete shock that
that was even a possibility.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.220
What it really was, was a
highly creative and determined

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.220
RND team deep in the bowels
of Afghanistan showing

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.410
us that we had certain
exploits that we were open to,

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.430
that nobody had chosen to express.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.820
I can think of several of
these things that I don't talk

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.610
about publicly, that
just seem to have to do

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.610
with how relatively unimaginative
those who wish to cause

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.020
havoc and destruction
have been up until now.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.363
The great mystery of our time,

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.160
of this particular little era,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.160
is how remarkably stable
we've been since 1945 when we

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.250
demonstrated the ability to
use nuclear weapons in anger.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:55.250
And, we don't know why things like

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.320
that haven't happened since then.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.830
We've had several close
calls, we've had mistakes,

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.170
we've had brinkmanship and
what's now happened is that

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:10.170
we've settled into a sense that
oh, it'll always be nothing.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.500
It's been so long since
something was at that level

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.790
of danger, that we've got
a wrong idea in our head

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.040
and that's why when I went
on the Ben Shapiro Show,

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.470
I talked about the need to
resume above ground testing

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.300
of nuclear devices because
we have people whose

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.920
developmental experience
suggests that when,

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.240
let's say Donald Trump and
North Korea engage on Twitter,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.980
oh it's nothing, it's just
posturing, everybody's just

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.560
in it for money, there's
a sense that people are in

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.560
a video game mode, which has
been the right call since 1945.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.330
We've been mostly in video game mode.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.500
It's amazing.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.200
- So you're worried about a generation

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.040
which has not seen any existential--

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.750
- We've lived under it.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.300
See, you're younger.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.140
I don't know if, and again,
you came from Moscow.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.800
- [Lex] From, yeah.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.610
- There was a TV show called
The Day After that had

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:14.610
a huge effect on a generation
growing up in the US,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.540
and it talked about what life would be

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.433
like after a nuclear exchange.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.530
We have not gone through
an embodied experience

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.450
collectively where we've
thought about this,

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.690
and I think it's one of
the most irresponsible

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.740
things that the elders among us have done,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.340
which is to provide this beautiful garden

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.300
in which the thorns are
cut off of the rosebushes

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:47.760
and all of the edges
are rounded and sanded,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.910
and so people have developed
this totally unreal idea

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.940
which is everything is
going to be just fine.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.190
And do I think that my
leading concern is AGI

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:01.890
or my leading concern is
thermonuclear exchange

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.110
or gene drives or any one of these things?

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.660
I don't know.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:10.660
But I know that our time here
in this very long experiment

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.400
here is finite, because
the toys that we've built

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.730
are so impressive and
the wisdom to accompany

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.000
them has not materialized.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And I think we actually got
a wisdom uptick since 1945.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.710
We had a lot of dangerous,
skilled players on the world

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.640
stage who nevertheless, no
matter how bad they were,

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.083
managed to not embroil us in something

00:27:36.083 --> 00:27:38.210
that we couldn't come back from.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.310
- The Cold War.
- Yeah, and the distance

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:45.163
from the Cold War, you
know, I'm very mindful of,

00:27:46.689 --> 00:27:49.130
there was a Russian tradition, actually,

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:53.380
of on your wedding day going to visit

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.760
a memorial to those who gave their lives.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.340
Can you imagine this?

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.260
Where on the happiest day of your life,

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.400
you go and you pay homage
to the people who fought

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.563
and died in the Battle of Stalingrad?

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.810
I'm not a huge fan of
communism, I gotta say,

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.120
but there were a couple of
things that the Russians did

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.800
that were really positive
in the Soviet era,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.350
and I think trying to let people know

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.180
how serious life actually
is, is the Russian model

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.420
of seriousness is better
than the American model.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.650
- And maybe, like you mentioned,

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:34.546
there was a small echo
of that after 9/11, but--

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.140
- We wouldn't let it form.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.040
We talk about 9/11, but it's 9/12

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.630
that really moved the needle.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.773
When we were all just there
and nobody wanted to speak.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.310
We witnessed something super serious

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.310
and we didn't want to run to our computers

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.933
and blast out our deep
thoughts and our feelings.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.470
And it was profound because
we woke up, briefly,

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.370
and I talk about the gated
institutional narrative

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.060
that sort of programs our lives,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.930
I've seen it break three times in my life.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.020
One of which was the
election of Donald Trump,

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.700
another time was the
fall of Lehman Brothers,

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.950
when everybody who knew that
Bear Stearns wasn't that

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.950
important, knew that Lehman
Brothers met AIG was next,

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.330
and the other one was 9/11.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.560
And so, if I'm 53 years old
and I only remember three times

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.310
that the global narrative
was really interrupted,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.950
that tells you how much we've been

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:43.217
on top of developing events, you know?

00:29:43.217 --> 00:29:45.710
We had the Murrah Federal
Building explosion,

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.680
but it didn't cause
the narrative to break,

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.980
it wasn't profound enough.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.963
Around 9/12, we started to
wake up out of our slumber,

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.960
and the powers that be, did
not want a coming together.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.663
You know, the admonition was go shopping.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.580
- The powers that be,
so what is that force?

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.840
As opposed to blaming individuals--

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.140
- We don't know.
- So whatever that--

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.270
- Whatever that force is.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.417
- In silence.
- There's a component of it

00:30:12.417 --> 00:30:14.230
that's emergent and there's a component

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.100
of it that's deliberate.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.700
So, give yourself a portfolio
with two components.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.980
Some amount of it is
emergent, but some amount of

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.300
it is also an understanding
that if people come together,

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.640
they become an incredible force.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.500
And what you're seeing
right now, I think is,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.740
there are forces that are
trying to come together

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.823
and there are forces that are
trying to push things apart,

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.890
and you know, one of them
is the globalist narrative

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.330
versus the national narrative.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.430
Where to the globalist perspective,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.130
the nations are bad things in essence.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.930
That they're temporary,
they're nationalistic,

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.500
they're jingoistic, it's all negative,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.810
to people more in the national
idiom, they're saying look,

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.640
this is where I pay my taxes,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.590
this is where I do my army service,

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.290
this is where I have a vote,

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:05.820
this is where I have a passport.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.940
Who the hell are you to tell
me that because you've moved

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.770
into some place that you
can make money globally,

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.130
that you've chosen to abandon other people

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.720
to whom you have a
special and elevated duty.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.970
And I think that these
competing narratives have been

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:24.170
pushing towards the global
perspective from the elite

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.650
and a larger and larger
number of disenfranchised

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.420
people are saying, hey, I
actually live in a place

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.370
and I have laws and I speak
a language, I have a culture,

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.680
and who are you to tell me
that because you can profit

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.020
in some far away land, that
my obligations to my fellow

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.250
countrymen are so much diminished.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.370
- So these tensions
between nations and so on,

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.640
ultimately you see being proud
of your country and so on,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.440
which creates potentially the kind

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.660
of things that led to wars and so on.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.370
They ultimately, it is human
nature and it is good for us,

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.085
for wake up calls of different kinds.

00:31:59.085 --> 00:32:01.170
- Well, I think that these are tensions.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.090
And my point isn't, I mean nationalism run

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.580
amuck is a nightmare.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.740
And internationalism run
amuck is a nightmare.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.740
And the problem is we're
trying to push these pendulums

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.210
to some place where
they're somewhat balanced.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:23.210
Where we have a higher duty
of care to those who share our

00:32:23.731 --> 00:32:26.810
laws and our citizenship,
but we don't forget

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.253
our duties of care to the global system.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.760
I would think this is elementary,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.760
but the problem that we're
facing concerns the ability for

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:43.050
some to profit by abandoning
their obligations to others

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.580
within their system and that's
what we've had for decades.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.240
- You mention nuclear weapons.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.310
I was hoping to get answers
from you since one of the many

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.930
things you've done as economics,

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.650
maybe you can understand human behavior

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.070
of why the heck we haven't
blown each other up yet.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.660
But okay, so we'll get--

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.213
- I don't know the answer.
- Yeah.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.720
It's really important to say
that we really don't know--

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.580
- [Eric] A mild uptick in wisdom.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.510
- A mild uptick in wisdom,
Steven Pinker who I've talked

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:17.940
with has a lot of really good
ideas about why, but he--

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.876
- I don't trust his optimism.

00:33:19.876 --> 00:33:22.220
(Lex chuckling)

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.150
- Listen, I'm Russian,
so I never trust a guy

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:24.983
who's that optimistic--

00:33:24.983 --> 00:33:27.430
- No, no, no, it's just
that you're talking about

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.710
a guy who's looking at a
system in which more and more

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.790
of the kinetic energy, like
war, has been turned into

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.370
potential energy like
unused nuclear weapons.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.720
- Wow, beautifully put.
- And you know now I'm looking

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.350
at that system and I'm saying, okay,

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.240
well if you don't have
a potential energy trim,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.980
then everything's just
getting better and better.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.150
- Yeah, yeah, wow, that's beautifully put.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.380
Only a physicist could, okay.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.161
- [Eric] I'm not a physicist.

00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:55.350
- Well, is that a dirty word?

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.830
- [Eric] No, no, I wish
I were a physicist.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.310
- Me too, my dad's a physicist.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:00.700
I'm trying to live up to that probably

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.900
for the rest of my life.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.090
He's probably gonna
listen to this too, so.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.340
- Hey dad.
- Yeah, (chuckling).

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.430
So, your friend, Sam Harris,

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:12.033
worries a lot about the
existential threat of AI.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.940
Not in the way that you've
described, but in the more.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.090
- Well, he hangs out with Elon.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.990
I don't know Elon.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.843
- So, are you worried about that kind of,

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:28.850
you know, about the, about
either robotics systems

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.100
or traditionally defined
AI systems essentially

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.380
becoming super intelligent,
much more intelligent

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.650
than human beings and getting--

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.203
- Well, they already are, and they're not.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.470
- When seen as a collective, you mean?

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.260
- I can mean all sorts of things,

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.280
but certainly, many of
the things that we thought

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.830
were peculiar to general intelligence

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.360
do not require general intelligence.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.960
So that's been one of the big
awakenings that you can write

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.683
a pretty convincing sports
story from stats alone.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.393
Without needing to have watched the game.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.840
So, you know, is it
possible to write lively

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.240
prose about politics?

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.323
Yeah, no, not yet.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.390
So, we're sort of all over the map.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.750
One of the things about chess,

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.420
there's a question I once asked on Quora

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.940
that didn't get a lot of response,

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.100
which was, what is the greatest
brilliancy ever produced

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.450
by a computer in a chess game?

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.760
Which was different than the question

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.510
of what is the greatest game ever played.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.960
So if you think about brilliancies,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.660
is what really animates many of us

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.313
to think of chess as an art form.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.060
Those are those moves and combinations

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:49.060
that just show such
flair, panache and soul.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:50.520
Computers weren't really great at that.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.330
They were great positional monsters.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:56.930
And recently we've started
seeing brilliancies.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.130
- [Lex] Yeah, a few
grandmasters have identified

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.890
with AlphaZero that things
were quite brilliant.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.280
- Yeah, so that's an example of something.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.230
We don't that that's AGI,
but in a very restricted set

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.700
of rules like chess,
you're starting to see

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.483
poetry of a high order.

00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:20.840
And so I don't like the idea
that we're waiting for AGI.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.840
AGI is sort of slowly infiltrating
our lives in the same way

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.700
that I don't think a worm should be,

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.840
you know C. Elegans shouldn't
be treated as non conscious

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.550
because it only has 300 neurons.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.820
Maybe it just has a very
low level of consciousness.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.790
Because we don't understand what

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.790
these things mean as they scale up.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:43.640
So, am I worried about
this general phenomena?

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.330
Sure, but I think that one of the things

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.390
that's happening is that
a lot of us are fretting

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.453
about this in part because of human needs.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.300
We've always been worried
about the Golem, right?

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.760
- [Lex] Well, the Golem is
the artificially created--

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.730
- Life, you know?

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:01.750
- [Lex] It's like Frankenstein
type of character--

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.823
- Yeah, sure, it's a Jewish version.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.780
Frankenberg, Franken--

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.290
- Yeah, that makes sense.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.470
- Sorry, so the, but we've
always been worried about

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.720
creating something like
this and it's getting closer

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.903
and closer and there are ways
in which we have to realize

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.440
that the whole thing, the whole thing that

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.303
we've experienced are
the context of our lives,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.370
is almost certainly coming to an end.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.660
And I don't mean to suggest

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.970
that we won't survive, I don't know.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.970
And I don't mean to suggest
that it's coming tomorrow.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:45.850
It could be 300, 500
years, but there's no plan

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.470
that I'm aware of, if
we have three rocks that

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:53.470
we could possibly inhabit that
are sensible within current

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.900
technological dreams; the
Earth, the Moon and Mars,

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.060
and we have a very
competitive civilization

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.100
that is still forced
into violence to sort out

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.450
disputes that cannot be arbitrated.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.870
It is not clear to me that we
have a long term future until

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:14.320
we get to the next stage,
which is to figure out whether

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.810
or not the Einsteinian
speed limit can be broken,

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.863
and that requires our source code.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.650
- Our source code, the stuff
in our brains to figure out?

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.450
What do you mean by our source code?

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.890
- The source code of the context.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.050
Whatever it is that produces the quarks,

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.550
the electrons, the neutrinos.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:35.130
- Oh, our source code,
I got it, so this is--

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.100
- You're talking about
the stuff that's written

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.190
in a higher level language.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.371
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:41.617
You're talking about the low
level, the bits or even lower--

00:38:41.617 --> 00:38:46.560
- Right, that's what is
currently keeping us here.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.560
We can't even imagine, you
know, we have hair brain schemes

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.363
for staying within the
Einsteinian speed limit.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.340
You know, maybe if we
could just drug ourselves

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.130
and go into a suspended state or we could

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.410
have multiple generations of that.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.810
I think all that stuff is pretty silly.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.170
But, I think it's also pretty
silly to imagine that our

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.330
wisdom is going to
increase to the point that

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.810
we can have the toys we have and we're

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.050
not going to use them for 500 years.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.440
- Speaking of Einstein, I had
a profound breakthrough when

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.360
I realized you're just one
letter away from the guy.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.960
- Yeah, but I'm also one
letter away from Feinstein.

00:39:24.107 --> 00:39:25.307
- Well, you get to pick.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.540
Okay, so, unified theory.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.690
You know, you've worked, you
enjoy the beauty of geometry.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.370
Well, I don't actually
know if you enjoy it.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.783
You certainly are quite good at it--

00:39:35.783 --> 00:39:37.983
- I tremble before it.
- Tremble before it.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.180
If you're religious that is one of the--

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.140
- I don't have to be religious.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.050
It's just so beautiful,
you will tremble anyway.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:50.050
- I just read Einstein's
biography and one of the ways,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.610
one of the things you've
done is try to explore

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:58.530
a unified theory talking about
a 14 dimensional observerse

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.033
that has the 4D space time
continuum embedded in it.

00:40:03.217 --> 00:40:05.990
I'm just curious how you think,

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.180
philosophically at a high level,

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.773
about something more than four dimensions.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.547
How do you try to, what does
it make you feel talking

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.280
in the mathematical world about dimensions

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.193
that are greater than
the ones we can perceive?

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.130
Is there something that you take away

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.050
that's more than just the math?

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.483
- Well, first of all, stick
out your tongue at me.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.790
Okay, now.
(Lex chuckling)

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.070
On the front of that tongue.
- Yeah?

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.520
- There was a sweet receptor.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.490
And next to that were salt
receptors on two different sides.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.670
A little bit farther back
there were sour receptors,

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.690
and you wouldn't show me the back

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.090
of your tongue where
your bitter receptor was.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:51.300
- [Lex] I show the good side always.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.300
- Okay, but that was four
dimensions of taste receptors.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.890
But you also had pain
receptors on that tongue

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.180
and probably heat
receptors on that tongue.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.200
So let's assume that you have one of each.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.330
That would be six dimensions.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.880
So when you eat something,
you eat a slice of pizza

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.360
and it's got some hot pepper
on it, maybe some jalapeno.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.680
You're having a six
dimensional experience, dude.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.120
- Do you think we over
emphasize the value of time

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.370
as one of the dimensions or space?

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.450
Well, we certainly over
emphasize the value of time

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.200
'cause we things to start and end,

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.490
or we really don't like things
to end, but they seem to.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.430
- Well, what if you flipped
one of the spacial dimensions

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.030
into being a temporal dimension?

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.690
And you and I were to meet
in New York City and say,

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.110
well where and when should we meet?

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:46.550
And I say, how about I'll
meet you on 36th and Lexington

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:51.263
at 2:00 in the afternoon and
11 o'clock in the morning?

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.690
That would be very confusing.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.970
- Well, it's so convenient for us

00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:59.310
to think about time, you mean?

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.070
- We happen to be in a
delicious situation in which

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.320
we have three dimensions
of space and one of time,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.500
and they're woven together in
this sort of strange fabric

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.430
where we can trade off a
little space for a little time.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.310
But we still only have one dimension

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.410
that is picked out relative
to the other three.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.600
It's very much Gladys Knight and the Pips.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.757
- So, which one developed for who?

00:42:17.757 --> 00:42:19.680
Did we develop for these dimensions?

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.500
Or did the dimensions, or were they always

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.660
there and it doesn't--

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.520
- Well, do you imagine
that there isn't a place

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.210
where there are four temporal dimensions?

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.810
Or two and two of space and time?

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.700
Or three of time and one of space?

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.870
And then would time not be
playing the role of space?

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.410
Why do you imagine that the sector

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.620
that you're in is all that there is?

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.900
- I certainly do not, but
I can't imagine otherwise.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.640
I mean, I haven't done
ayahuasca or any of those drugs.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.110
I hope to one day, but--

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.060
- Instead of doing ayahuasca,

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.550
you could just head over to Building Two.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.810
- That's where the mathematicians are?

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.090
- [Eric] Yeah, that's where they hang.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.430
- [Lex] Just to look at some geometry?

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.530
- Well just ask about
pseudo-Riemannian geometry,

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.982
that's what you're interested in.

00:42:56.982 --> 00:42:58.550
(Lex chuckling)
- [Lex] Okay.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.440
- Or you can talk to a
shaman and end up in Peru.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.080
- And then some extra
money for that trip--

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.920
- Yeah, but you won't be
able to do any calculations

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.460
if that's how you choose to go about it.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.310
- Well, a different kind of calculation--

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.810
- So to speak.
- Yeah.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.650
One of my favorite people, Edward Franco,

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.890
Berkeley professor,
author of Love and Math,

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:18.530
great title for a book,
said that you were quite a

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.100
remarkable intellect to
come up with such beautiful,

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.070
original ideas in terms of
unified theory and so on.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.120
But you were working outside academia.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.193
So, one question in developing ideas

00:43:31.193 --> 00:43:33.530
that are truly original,
truly interesting,

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.680
what's the difference between
inside academia and outside

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.560
academia when it comes
to developing such ideas?

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.170
- Oh, it's a terrible
choice, a terrible choice.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:46.880
So, if you do it inside of academics,

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.660
you are forced to constantly...

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.770
show great loyalty to the consensus

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:00.340
and you distinguish yourself with small,

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.970
almost microscopic heresies

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.043
to make your reputation in general.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:10.477
And you have very competent
people and brilliant people who

00:44:10.477 --> 00:44:15.477
are working together who formed
very deep social networks,

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:21.150
and have a very high level of behavior,

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.130
at least within mathematics
and at least technically

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.203
within physics, theoretical physics.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:31.393
When you go outside, you meet
lunatics and crazy people.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:38.340
Madmen and these are people
who do not usually subscribe

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:42.353
to the consensus position and
almost always lose their way.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:48.810
And the key question is will
progress likely come from

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.200
someone who is miraculously
managed to stay within

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.700
the system and is able to
take on a larger amount

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.363
of heresy, that is sort of unthinkable?

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.550
In which case, that will be fascinating.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.400
Or, is it more likely that
somebody will maintain a level

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.400
of discipline from outside of
academics and be able to make

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.600
use of the freedom that comes
from not having to constantly

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.720
affirm your loyalty to the
consensus of your field.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.070
- So you've characterized
in ways that academia,

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.150
in this particular sense is declining.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.590
You posted the plot, the older population

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.420
of the faculty is getting larger.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.080
The younger is getting smaller and so on.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.670
So, which direction of the two
are you more hopeful about?

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.280
- Well, the Baby Boomers
can't hang on forever.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.630
- Which is first of all in general true,

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:46.470
and second of all in academia--

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.470
- But that's really what
this time is about--

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.360
- Is the Baby Boomers control.
- Is we didn't, we're used to

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.610
like financial bubbles
that last a few years

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:57.000
in length and then pop.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.970
- Yes.
- The Baby Boomer bubble

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:03.940
is this really long lived
thing and all of the ideology,

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.220
all of the behavior patterns,
the norms, you know,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.950
for example string theory is an almost

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.620
entirely Baby Boomer phenomena.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.260
It was something that Baby
Boomers were able to do because

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:18.463
it required a very high level
of mathematical ability.

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.890
- You don't think of string
theory as an original idea?

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.627
- Oh, I mean it was original to Veneziano

00:46:26.627 --> 00:46:29.700
who probably is older
than the Baby Boomers

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.170
and there are people who are younger than

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.350
the Baby Boomers who are
still doing string theory.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:36.140
And I'm not saying that
nothing discovered within

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.480
the large string theoretic
complex is wrong.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.470
Quite the contrary.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:43.070
A lot of brilliant mathematics
and a lot of the structure

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.673
of physics was elucidated
by string theorists.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:49.260
What do I think of the deliverable nature

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.480
of this product that will not
ship called string theory?

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.340
I think that is largely an
affirmative action program

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.400
for highly mathematically
and geometrically

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.620
talented Baby Boomer
physicists so that they

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:06.560
can say that they're
working on something within

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.460
the constraints of what they
will say is quantum gravity.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.230
Now there are other schemes.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.580
You know, there's like asymptotic safety.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.140
There are other things that
you could imagine doing.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.800
I don't think much of any
of the major programs,

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.800
but to have inflicted this
level of loyalty through

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.560
a shibboleth, well surely
you don't question x.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.830
Well, I question almost
everything in the string program,

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:34.260
and that's why I got out of physics.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.350
When you called me
physicist, was a great honor,

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.180
but the reason I didn't become a physicist

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.300
wasn't that I fell in
love with mathematics.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:46.300
As I said, wow, in 1984, 1983,
I saw the field going mad,

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:51.120
and I saw that mathematics,
which has all sorts of problems,

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.940
was not going insane.

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.530
And so instead of studying
things within physics,

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:57.120
I thought it was much safer to study

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.270
the same objects within mathematics.

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.190
And there's a huge price to pay for that.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:03.460
You lose physical intuition.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.560
But the point is, is that it wasn't

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.220
a North Korean reeducation camp, either.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.240
- Are you hopeful about cracking open

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.590
the Einstein Unified
Theory in a way that has,

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:19.273
in really understanding
whether uniting everything

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.980
together with quantum theory and so on?

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.220
- I mean, I'm trying to
play this role myself.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:30.020
To do it to the extent of
handing it over to the more

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.823
responsible, more professional,
more competent community.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.760
So, I think that they're
wrong about a great number

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.280
of their belief structures,
but I do believe,

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.160
I mean I have a really
profound love hate relationship

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.058
with this group of people.

00:48:47.058 --> 00:48:48.710
- On the physics side?
- Oh yeah.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:50.360
- 'Cause the mathematicians actually seem

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.200
to be much more open minded and--

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.100
- Well, they are and they aren't.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.610
They're open minded about anything

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.430
that looks like great math.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.450
- Right.
- Right, they'll study

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.220
something that isn't
very important physics,

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.283
but if it's beautiful
mathematics then they'll have,

00:49:03.283 --> 00:49:06.140
they have great intuition
about these things.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.930
As good as the mathematicians are,

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:09.560
and I might even intellectually

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.770
at some horsepower level
give them the edge.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:16.640
The theoretical physics
community is bar none,

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.900
the most profound intellectual community

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.950
that we have ever created.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:25.010
It is the number one, there
is nobody in second place

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.843
as far as I'm concerned.

00:49:25.843 --> 00:49:29.280
Like, in their spare time,
in the spare time they

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.110
invented molecular biology.

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.150
- What was the origin
of molecular biology?

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.021
You're saying physicists--

00:49:34.021 --> 00:49:35.110
- Well somebody like Francis Crick.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.650
A lot of the early molecular biologists--

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.870
- Were physicists?
- Yeah, I mean you know,

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.027
Schrodinger wrote What is Life

00:49:42.027 --> 00:49:44.470
and that was highly inspirational.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:49.470
I mean, you have to appreciate
that there is no community

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.720
like the basic research
community in theoretical physics.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.440
And it's not something, I'm
highly critical of these guys.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.440
I think that they would just
wasted the decades of time with

00:50:06.752 --> 00:50:11.060
and your religious devotion
to their misconceptualization

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.290
of where the problems were in physics.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.270
But this has been the
greatest intellectual

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.803
collapse ever witnessed within academics.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.790
- You see it as a collapse or just a lull?

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:25.970
- Oh, I'm terrified that we're
about to lose the vitality.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.963
We can't afford to pay these people.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.910
We can't afford to give them
an accelerator just to play

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:35.230
with in case they find something
at the next energy level.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.253
These people created our economy.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.840
They gave us the RAD Lab and radar.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.570
They gave us two atomic
devices to end World War II.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.460
They created the semi-conductor
and the transistor

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.240
to power our economy through Moore's law.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.750
As a positive externality
of particle accelerators,

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:56.420
they created the World Wide Web

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.100
and we have the insolence to say,

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.450
why should we fund you
with our taxpayer dollars?

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:06.253
No, the question is, are you
enjoying your physics dollars?

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.970
Right, these guys signed the world's

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:11.900
worst licensing agreement.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.540
- Right.
- And, if they simply charged

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.260
for every time you used a
transistor or a URL or enjoyed

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:24.060
the peace that they have
provided during this period

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.910
of time through the terrible
weapons that they developed,

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:29.680
or your communications devices.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.360
All of the things that power our economy,

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.950
I really think came out of physics,

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.780
even to the extent that
chemistry came out of physics,

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.970
and molecular biology came out of physics.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.030
So, first of all you have to know

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.530
that I'm very critical of this community.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.140
Second of all, it is our
most important community.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.630
We have neglected it, we've abused it,

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:51.300
we don't take it seriously,
we don't even care to get

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.380
them to rehab after a couple
of generations of failure.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.060
Right, no one, I mean I
think the youngest person

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.080
to have really contributed
to the standard model

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:05.710
at a theoretical level
was born in 1951, right?

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:06.543
Frank Wilczek.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:12.660
And almost nothing has happened
that in theoretical physics

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:17.080
after 1973, '74, that
sent somebody to Stockholm

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.690
for theoretical development
that predicted experiment.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.290
So, we have to understand

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.820
that we are doing this to ourselves.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.510
Now, with that said, these
guys have behaved abysmally,

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:32.040
in my opinion, because
they haven't owned up

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.450
to where they actually are,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.990
what problems they're really facing,

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.360
how definite they can actually be.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.490
They haven't shared some of their

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:40.930
most brilliant discoveries,
which are desperately needed

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.220
in other fields like gauge theory,

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.650
which at least the
mathematicians can share,

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:47.480
which is an upgrade of
the differential calculus

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.050
of Newton and Leibniz,

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:50.650
and they haven't shared the importance

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:53.640
of renormalization theory,
even though this should

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.860
be standard operating
procedure for people across

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.510
the sciences dealing with different layers

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.080
and different levels of phenomena, so--

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.500
- And by shared you mean
communicated in such a way

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.860
that it disseminates throughout
the different sciences?

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.760
- These guys are sitting,
both theoretical physicists

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.900
and mathematicians are sitting on top

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:16.133
of a giant stockpile of
intellectual gold, right?

00:53:16.133 --> 00:53:17.850
They have so many things that

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.780
have not been manifested anywhere.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.000
I was just on Twitter I think

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.780
I mentioned the Hoberman switch pitch

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.010
that shows the self
duality of the tetrahedron

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:29.690
realizes that it linkage mechanism.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:33.040
Now this is like a triviality and it makes

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.710
an amazing toy that's,

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.510
you know, built a market.
- Yeah.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.560
- Hopefully a fortune for Chuck Hoberman.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.330
Well, you have no idea
how much great stuff

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.493
that these priests have
in their monastery.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.130
- So, it's a truly a love and
hate relationship for you?

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.490
It sounds like it's
more on the love side--

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:50.950
- [Eric] This building
that we're in right here.

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.010
- Yes.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.870
- Is the building in which
I really put together

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:57.690
the conspiracy between the
National Academy of Sciences

00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:00.250
and the National Science
Foundation through

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.220
the Government University
Industry Research round table

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.490
to destroy the bargaining
power of American

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.523
academics using foreign labor.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.110
On microfiche in the base.
- Post docs and so on?

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:13.280
- Oh yeah, that was done
here in this building.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.400
Isn't that weird?

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.216
- I'm truly speaking with a
revolutionary and a radical--

00:54:18.216 --> 00:54:20.140
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:25.140
At an intellectual level, I
am absolutely garden variety.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.610
I'm just straight down the middle.

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:30.000
The system that we are in.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.680
This University is functionally insane.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.740
- [Lex] Yeah.

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:37.470
- Harvard is functionally
insane and we don't

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:41.210
understand that when we
get these things wrong,

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.610
the financial crisis made this very clear.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.170
There was a long period
where every grownup,

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:51.170
everybody with a tie who
spoke in baritone tones

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.480
with a right degree at
the end of their name.

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.600
- Yeah.
- Were talking about how

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.773
we banished volatility, we
were in the great moderation.

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.070
Okay, they were all crazy.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:05.250
And who was right?

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:06.810
It was like Nassim Taleb.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.430
- Right.
- Nouriel Roubini.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.170
Now, what happens is is that they

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:13.010
claimed the market went crazy.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:14.660
But the market didn't go crazy.

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.920
The market had been crazy
and what happened is

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.090
is that it suddenly went sane.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:21.160
Well that's where we are with academics.

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.910
Academics right now is mad as a hatter

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.570
and it's absolutely evident.

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:27.080
I can show you graph after graph.

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.590
I can show you the internal discussions.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.590
I can show you the conspiracies.

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:33.510
Harvard's dealing with one
right now over its admissions

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.230
policies for people of color
who happen to come from Asia.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:41.930
All of this madness is necessary
to keep the game going.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:44.569
What we're talking about,
just while we're on

00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:47.147
the topic of revolutionaries,
is we're talking about

00:55:47.147 --> 00:55:49.853
the danger of an outbreak of sanity.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.060
- Yeah, you're the guy pointing out

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.380
the elephant in the room here and--

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.880
- The elephant has no clothes.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.620
- Is that how that goes?

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:04.620
I was gonna talk a little
bit to Joe Rogan about this,

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:09.493
ran out of time, but
I think you have some,

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:13.040
just listening to you, you
can probably speak really

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.520
eloquently to academia on the difference

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.550
between the different fields.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:19.890
So, do you think there's a
difference between science,

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:22.490
engineering and then the
humanities in academia,

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.860
in terms of tolerance, that
they're willing to tolerate?

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:30.790
So, from my perspective I
thought computer science

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:34.750
and maybe engineering is more
tolerant to radical ideas,

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.507
but that's perhaps innocent of me.

00:56:36.507 --> 00:56:39.320
'Cause I always, you know
all the battles going

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.450
on now are a little bit
more of the humanities side

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:43.210
and gender studies and so on.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:46.590
- Have you seen the American
Mathematical Society's

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:49.490
publication of an essay
called Get out the Way.

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:53.390
- I have not, what's the--
- The idea is that white men

00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:58.070
who hold positions within
Universities in mathematics

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:01.730
should vacate their positions
so that young black women

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:03.850
can take over or something like this.

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.900
- That's in terms of diversity,

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.140
which I also wanted to ask you about,

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:10.190
but in terms of diversity
of strictly ideas.

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:12.420
- Oh, sure.
- Do you think,

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.030
'cause you're basically
saying physics as a community,

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:17.780
has become a little bit
intolerant to some degree,

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.517
to new radical ideas or
at least you said that--

00:57:21.517 --> 00:57:24.210
- But it's changed a little bit recently.

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:28.150
Which is that even string
theory is now admitting,

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:32.140
okay, this doesn't look very
promising in the short term.

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:36.023
Right, so the question is what compiles,

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.640
if you wanna take the
computer science metaphor.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.950
What will get you into a journal?

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.300
Will you spend your life
trying to push some paper

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.490
into a journal or will
it be accepted easily?

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:50.390
What do we know about the
characteristics of the submitter

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:55.473
and what gets taken up and what does not?

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:59.240
All of these fields are
experiencing pressure because

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:04.240
no field is performing so
brilliantly well that it's

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:09.850
revolutionizing our way
of speaking and thinking,

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:12.840
in the ways in which we
have become accustomed.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.913
- But don't you think, even
in theoretical physics,

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.910
a lot of times, even with
theories like string theory,

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.900
you could speak to this,
it does eventually lead to

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.550
what are the ways that this
theory would be testable?

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.800
- Yeah, ultimately, although look,

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.640
there's this thing about Popper

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.830
and the scientific method that's a cancer

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:36.300
and a disease in the minds
of very smart people.

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:39.830
That's not really how most
of the stuff gets worked out,

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.213
it's how it gets checked.

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.440
- Right, so--
- And there is a dialog

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.550
between theory and experiment.

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:49.970
But, everybody should
read Paul Dirac's 1963

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:56.670
Scientific American article where he,

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:57.790
you know, it's very interesting.

00:58:57.790 --> 00:58:59.560
He talks about it as if it was about

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.760
the Schrodinger equation
and Schrodinger's failure

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.760
to advance his own work
because of his failure

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.300
to account for some phenomena.

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.760
The key point is that if your
theory is a slight bit off,

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.200
it won't agree with experiment,

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.530
but it doesn't mean that the
theory is actually wrong.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.310
But Dirac could as easily have
been talking about his own

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:18.790
equation in which he predicted

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:22.080
that the electrons should
have an anti-particle.

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.890
And since the only positively
charged particle that was

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.790
known at the time was the
proton, Heisenberg pointed out,

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:30.190
well shouldn't your
anti-particle, the proton,

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:31.660
have the same mass as the electron

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.600
and doesn't that invalidate your theory?

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.630
So, I think that Dirac was actually being,

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:39.400
potentially quite sneaky
in talking about the fact

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.340
that he had been pushed
off of his own theory,

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.933
to some extent, by Heisenberg.

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:47.990
But look, we fetishize
the scientific method

00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:52.250
and Popper and falsification
because it protects

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:55.510
us from crazy ideas entering the field.

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:57.920
So, you know, it's a question
of balancing type one and type

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.490
two error and we were pretty
maxed out in one direction.

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:02.700
- The opposite of that.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.180
Let me say what comforts me.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:09.180
Sort of biology or engineering
at the end of the day,

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:11.550
does the thing work?
- Yeah.

01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:15.490
- You can test the crazies away.

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:17.987
Well see now, you're saying
but some ideas are truly crazy

01:00:17.987 --> 01:00:21.360
and some are actually correct, so.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.350
- Well there's pre-correct
currently crazy.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:25.340
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.210
And so you don't wanna
get rid of everybody

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.713
who's pre-correct and currently crazy.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.240
The problem is is that we don't
have standards in general,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.110
for trying to determine who has to be put

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.450
to the sword in terms of their career

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:44.660
and who has to be protected
as some sort of giant time

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.900
suck pain in the ass who
may change everything.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.260
- Do you think that's possible?

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.370
Creating a mechanism of those selective--

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.310
- Well, you're not gonna like
the answer, but here it comes.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.180
- [Lex] Oh, boy.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.400
- It has to do with very human elements.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.810
We're trying to do this
at the level of like rules

01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:03.553
and fairness, it's not gonna work.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.943
'Cause the only thing that
really understands this,

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.280
you ever read The Double Helix?

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.113
- It's a book?

01:01:13.113 --> 01:01:14.669
- Oh, you have to read this book--

01:01:14.669 --> 01:01:17.510
- Oh, boy.
- Not only did Jim Watson

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:22.000
half discover this three
dimensional structure of DNA,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.973
he was also one hell of a
writer before he became an ass.

01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:28.090
No, he's tried
- Yes, like he is.

01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:29.740
- To destroy his own reputation--

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.950
- I knew about the ass, I didn't
know about the good writer.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.810
- Jim Watson is one of the most
important people now living,

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:40.550
and as I've said before,
Jim Watson is too important

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:42.863
a legacy to be left to Jim Watson.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:49.290
That book tells you more about
what actually moves the dial.

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.760
I mean, there's another
story about him which

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.410
I don't agree with, which is that he stole

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.860
everything from Rosalind Franklin.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.360
I mean, the problems that he
had with Rosalind Franklin

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.340
are real, but we should
actually honor that tension

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.100
in our history by delving into it,

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.190
rather than having a simple solution.

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:09.300
Jim Watson talks about Francis
Crick being a pain in the ass

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.750
that everybody secretly
knew was super brilliant.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:17.670
And there's an encounter between
Chargaff who came up with

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:20.910
the equimolar relations
between the nucleotides,

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.290
who should've gotten the structure

01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:24.670
of DNA and Watson and Crick,

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:28.960
and you know, he talks
about missing a shiver

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.640
in the heartbeat of biology
and this stuff is so gorgeous,

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.453
it just makes you tremble
even thinking about it.

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:41.310
Look, we know very often
who is to be feared,

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:44.033
and we need to fund the
people that we fear.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.320
The people who are wasting our time need

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.700
to be excluded from the conversation.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:53.010
You see, and you know,
maybe we'll make some errors

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:58.010
in both directions, but we
have known our own people.

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:01.050
We know the pains in the
asses that might work out,

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:03.430
and we know the people who
are really just blowhards who

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:07.380
really have very little to
contribute most of the time.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.490
It's not 100%, but you're not
gonna get there with rules.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.670
- Right, it's using some kind of instinct.

01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:16.080
I mean, to be honest, I'm
gonna make you roll your eyes

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.827
for a second, but in the
first time I heard that there

01:03:19.827 --> 01:03:22.827
was large community of people
who believe the earth is flat,

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.450
actually made me pause and
ask myself the question--

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:28.030
- Why would there be such a community?

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:30.230
- Yeah, is it possible the earth is flat?

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.023
So I had to like, wait a minute.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.180
I mean, then you go
through a thinking process

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:37.530
that I think is really healthy.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:40.233
It ultimately ends up being
a geometry thing I think.

01:03:41.782 --> 01:03:44.160
It's an interesting thought
experiment at the very least.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.610
- Well, see I don't, I do
a different version of it.

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:48.700
I say, why is this community stable?

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.560
- Yeah, that's a good way to analyze it.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.260
- Interesting that whatever we've done

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.963
has not erased the community.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:57.880
So, you know, they're
taking a long shot bet

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.333
that won't pan out, you know?

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:01.880
Maybe we just haven't thought enough about

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.530
the rationality of the square root of two

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:05.230
and somebody brilliant will figure it out.

01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:07.130
Maybe we will eventually land one day

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:09.180
on the surface of Jupiter and explore it.

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:14.080
Right, these are crazy things
that will never happen.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.307
- So, much of social media
operates by AI algorithms,

01:04:17.307 --> 01:04:19.580
we talked this a little bit,

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.750
recommending the content you see.

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:26.620
So, on this idea of radical
thought, how much should AI show

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.883
you things you disagree
with on Twitter and so on?

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:32.810
In the Twitterverse in the--

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:34.560
- I hate this question.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:37.340
- 'Cause you don't know the answer?

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.960
- No, no, no, no.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.140
Look, they've pushed
out this cognitive Lego

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.820
to us that will just lead to madness.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.983
It's good to be challenged with things

01:04:47.983 --> 01:04:49.187
that you disagree with.

01:04:49.187 --> 01:04:50.550
You answer is, no.

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:53.240
It's gonna to be challenged
with interesting things with

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:57.150
which you currently disagree,
but that might be true.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:59.110
I don't really care about
whether or not I disagree

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:01.390
with something or don't
disagree, I need to know why

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:05.400
that particular disagreeable
thing is being pushed out.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.080
Is it because it's likely to be true?

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.760
Is it because, is there some reason?

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.880
Because I write a computer
generator to come up

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.940
with an infinite number
of disagreeable statements

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.680
that nobody needs to look at.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.700
So, please before you push things at me

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.810
that are disagreeable, tell me why.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.260
- There is an aspect in which
that question is quite dumb,

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.900
especially because it's
being used to almost

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.810
very generically by these
different networks to say,

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:35.490
well we're trying to work this out,

01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:39.670
but you know, basically how much,

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:43.600
do you see the value of
seeing things you don't like?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.170
Not you disagree with, because
it's very difficult to know

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:50.540
exactly what you articulated,
which is the stuff that's

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.380
important for you to consider
that you disagree with.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.000
That's really hard to figure out.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.180
The bottom line is the
stuff you don't like.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:00.823
If you're a Hillary Clinton supporter,

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.840
it might not make you feel good

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.870
to see anything about Donald Trump.

01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:06.980
That's the only thing algorithms

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.970
can really optimize for currently.

01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:10.963
They really can't--
- No, they can do better.

01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:14.280
- You think so?
- No, we're engaged in some

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.280
moronic back and forth where
I have no idea why people who

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.620
are capable of building Google, Facebook,

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.020
Twitter are having us in these

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.930
incredibly low level discussions.

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.240
Do they not know any smart people?

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.820
Do they not have the phone numbers

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.020
of people who can elevate
these discussions?

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.065
- They do, but this--

01:06:39.065 --> 01:06:39.898
- Please, no, no, no.
- They're optimizing for

01:06:39.898 --> 01:06:41.170
a different thing and they are pushing

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:42.443
those people out of those rooms.

01:06:42.443 --> 01:06:46.113
- No, they're optimizing
for things we can't see,

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.620
and yes, profit is there.

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.280
Nobody's questioning that.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.820
But they're also optimizing
for things like political

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.670
control or the fact that
they're doing business

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:59.230
in Pakistan and so they don't
wanna talk about all the

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:03.320
things that they're going
to bending to in Pakistan.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.420
So, we're involved in a fake discussion.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.160
- You think so, you
think these conversations

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.270
at that depth are happening inside Google?

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:12.540
You don't think they have some

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.750
basic metrics under user engagements?

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:18.260
- You're having a fake
conversation with us, guys.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.940
We know you're having a fake conversation.

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.490
I do not wish to be part
of your fake conversation.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.740
You know how to cool these units.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.380
You know high availability
like nobody's business.

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:33.200
My Gmail never goes down, almost.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.400
- So you think just because
they can do incredible work on

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.330
the software side with infrastructure,

01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:43.330
they can also deal with some
of these difficult questions

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:46.330
about human behavior, human understanding,

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.699
you're not, (chuckling).

01:07:47.699 --> 01:07:50.950
- I mean, I've seen
the developer's screens

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:54.270
that people take shots
of inside of Google.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.340
- [Lex] Yeah.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.470
- And I've heard stories
inside of Facebook and Apple.

01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:01.450
We're not, we're engaged, they're engaging

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:04.100
us in the wrong conversations.

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.120
We are not at this low level.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.240
Here's one of my favorite questions.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.070
- Yeah.
- Why is every piece

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:13.610
of hardware that I purchase in text base

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:15.603
equipped as a listening device?

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:19.780
Where's my physical
shutter to cover my lens?

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:22.670
We had this in the 1970s.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:25.130
They had cameras that
had lens caps, you know?

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:27.940
How much would it cost
to have a security model?

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.830
Pay five extra bucks.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:33.090
Why is my indicator light
software controlled?

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:35.930
Why when my camera is on, do
I not see that the light is

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:39.730
on by putting it as something
that cannot be bypassed?

01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:43.030
Why have you setup all of my devices,

01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:44.990
at some difficulty to yourselves,

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.750
as listening devices and we
don't even talk about this.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:51.550
This thing is total fucking bullshit.

01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.100
- Well, I hope, so.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.430
- These discussions are
happening about privacy,

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.100
'cause they're more difficult
than you give 'em credit for--

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.070
- It's not just privacy.
- Yeah?

01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.120
- It's about social control.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.600
We're talking about social control.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.160
Why do I not have controls
over my own levers?

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.980
Just have a really cute
UI, where I can switch,

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.540
I can dial things or I can at least

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.410
see what the algorithms are.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.080
- You think that there are some

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.410
deliberate choices being made here--

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:21.610
- There's emergence
and there is intention.

01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:22.970
There are two dimensions.

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:26.360
The vector does not
collapse onto either axis.

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.130
But the idea that anybody who suggests

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:34.130
that intention is completely
absent is a child.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.470
- That's really beautifully
put and like many things

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:38.901
you've said is gonna make me--

01:09:38.901 --> 01:09:40.850
- Can I turn this around slightly though?

01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:42.407
- Yeah.
- I sit down with you

01:09:42.407 --> 01:09:44.960
and you say that you're
obsessed with my feed.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.410
- Uh huh.
- I don't even know what

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:49.780
my feed is, what are
you seeing that I'm not?

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:53.620
- I was obsessively looking
through your feed on Twitter,

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.440
'cause it was really
enjoyable because there's

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.280
the Tom Lehrer element,
there's the humor in it.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.730
- By the way that feed is
ericrweinstein on Twitter.

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.043
- That's great.
- @ericrweinstein.

01:10:04.124 --> 01:10:06.650
- Yeah.
- No, but seriously, why?

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:10.220
- Why did I find it enjoyable
or what was I seeing?

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.400
- What are you looking for?

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.960
Why are we doing this?

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.850
What is this podcast about?

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:16.520
I know you got all these
interesting people.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.970
I'm just some guy who is
sort of a podcast guest.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.410
- Sort of a podcast, you're
not even wearing a tie.

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:23.282
I mean,
- I'm not even wearing a tie.

01:10:23.282 --> 01:10:25.082
- It's not even a serious interview.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.610
I was searching for
meaning, for happiness,

01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:34.470
for a dopamine rush, so
short term and long term.

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:36.720
- And how are you finding your way to me?

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.260
What is, I don't honestly know
what I'm doing to reach you.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:45.870
- The representing ideas
which field common sense

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.920
to me and not many people are speaking.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.453
So it's kinda like, the
Intellectual Dark Web folks, right?

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.590
These folks, from Sam
Harris to Jordan Peterson,

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.400
to yourself, are saying
things where it's like,

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.160
you're like saying,
look there's an elephant

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.160
and he's not wearing any
clothes and I say, yeah, yeah,

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.460
let's have more of that conversation.

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.010
That's how I'm finding you.

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:13.360
- I'm desperate to try to change

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.750
the conversation we're having.

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:17.460
I'm very worried we've
got an election in 2020.

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.600
I don't think we can
afford four more years of

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:25.360
a misinterpreted message,
which is what Donald Trump was,

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.410
and I don't want the
destruction of our institutions.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.630
They all seem hellbent
on destroying themselves.

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:33.220
So, I'm trying to save
theoretical physics,

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.780
trying to save the New York Times,

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.340
trying to save our various
processes and I think it feels

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:44.170
delusional to me that this
is falling to a tiny group

01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:47.870
of people who are willing
to speak out without getting

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.720
so freaked out that everything they say

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.490
will be misinterpreted
and that their lives

01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:53.138
will be ruined through the process.

01:11:53.138 --> 01:11:56.040
I mean, I think we're in an
absolutely bananas period

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.300
of time and I don't believe
it should fall to such

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.173
a tiny number of shoulders
to shoulder this weight.

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:05.880
- So, I have to ask you
on a capitalism side,

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.220
you mentioned that technology
is killing capitalism

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:12.930
or has effects that are,
well not unintended,

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.050
but not what economists would predict

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:18.830
or speak of capitalism creating.

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:21.300
I just wanna talk to you about in general,

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.680
the effect of even then,
artificial intelligence

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.790
or technology automation taking
away jobs and these kinds

01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:31.540
of things and what you think
is the way to alleviate that.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.910
Whether the Andrew Ang
presidential candidate with

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:38.700
universal basic income, UBI,
what are your thoughts there?

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.840
How do we fight off the negative effects

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.552
of technology that--

01:12:42.552 --> 01:12:43.810
- All right, you're a software guy, right?

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:44.643
- Yep.

01:12:44.643 --> 01:12:48.840
- A human being is a
worker, is an old idea.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.580
- Yes.
- A human being has a worker

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.990
is a different object, right?
- Yes.

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:55.770
- So if you think about
object oriented programming

01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:59.660
as a paradigm, a human being has a worker

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.870
and a human being has a soul.

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:04.420
We're talking about the fact
that for a period of time,

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.773
the worker that a human being has,

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:11.373
was in a position to feed the
soul that a human being has.

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:15.070
However, we have two separate claims

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.063
on the value in society.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.750
One is as a worker and
the other is as a soul,

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:23.490
and the soul needs
sustenance, it needs dignity,

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:25.363
it needs meaning, it needs purpose.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:32.420
As long as you're means of
support is not highly repetitive,

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:34.850
I think you have a while to go

01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:36.960
before you need to start worrying.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.790
But if what you do is highly repetitive

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:42.640
and it's not terrible generative,
you are in the crosshairs

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.300
of for loops and while loops and that's

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:50.050
what computers accel at;
repetitive behavior and when I say

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:53.440
repetitive I may mean things
that have never happened

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.860
through combinatorial possibilities,

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:57.240
but as long as it has a
looped characteristic to it,

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.140
you're in trouble.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:03.000
We are seeing a massive
push towards socialism

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.230
because capitalists are slow to address

01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:10.920
the fact that a worker may
not be able to make claims.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.710
A relatively undistinguished
median member of our society

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:19.387
still has needs to
reproduce, needs to dignity

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.570
and when capitalism abandons
the median individual

01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:29.703
or the bottom tenth or
whatever it's going to do,

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:34.250
it's flirting with revolution
and what concerns me

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:36.330
is that the capitalists
aren't sufficiently

01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:38.113
capitalistic to understand this.

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:43.080
You really want to court
authoritarian control

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.010
in our society because you
can't see that people may not

01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:48.200
be able to defend themselves
in the marketplace

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.090
because the marginal
product of their labor

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:55.080
is too low to feed
their dignity as a soul?

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.480
So, my great concern is
that our free society

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.370
has to do with the fact
that we are self organized.

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:05.020
I remember looking down
from my office in Manhattan

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.950
when Lehman Brothers
collapsed and thinking,

01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:09.970
who's gonna tell all these
people that they need

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:14.150
to show up at work when they
don't have a financial system

01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:16.493
to incentivize them to show up at work?

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:20.920
So, my complaint is first of
all, not with the socialists,

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.040
but with the capitalists,

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.570
which is you guys are being idiots.

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:28.900
You're courting revolution by
continuing to harp on the same

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.090
old ideas that well, try
harder, bootstrap yourself.

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:35.513
Yeah, to an extent that
works, to an extent.

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.700
But we are clearly headed in
a place that there's nothing

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:43.700
that ties together our need
to contribute and our need

01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:47.630
to consume and that may not
be provided by capitalism,

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:49.490
because it may have been
a temporary phenomena.

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:52.840
So, check out my article
on anthropic capitalism

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.070
and the new gimmick economy.

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:58.050
I think people are late
getting the wake up call,

01:15:58.050 --> 01:16:01.130
and we would be doing a
better job saving capitalism

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:04.200
from itself because I don't want this done

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.630
under authoritarian control,
and the more we insist that

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:10.530
everybody who's not thriving
in our society during their

01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:13.070
reproductive years in
order to have a family,

01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:15.333
is failing at a personal level.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.410
I mean, what a disgusting
thing that we're saying.

01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:19.960
What a horrible message.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.710
Who the hell have we
become that we've so bought

01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:26.630
in to the Chicago model that
we can't see the humanity

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:28.170
that we're destroying in that process

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:32.120
and I hate the thought of
communism, I really do.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.590
My family has flirted
with it decades past,

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:38.260
it's a wrong, bad idea, but
we are going to need to figure

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.892
out how to make sure that
those souls are nourished

01:16:41.892 --> 01:16:45.100
and respected and capitalism
better have an answer.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.260
And I'm betting on capitalism,
but I gotta tell ya,

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.110
I'm pretty disappointed with my team.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:52.210
- So you're still on the capitalism team,

01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:54.212
just there's a theme here--

01:16:54.212 --> 01:16:55.812
- [Eric] Well, radical capitalism.

01:16:55.812 --> 01:16:56.820
- Right, hyper capitalism, yeah.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.970
- Look, I want, I think
hyper capitalism is gonna

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:02.030
have to be coupled to hyper socialism.

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:04.300
You need to allow the
most productive people

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.270
to create wonders and you
gotta stop bogging them down

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:10.990
with all of these extra nice requirements.

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:12.920
You know, nice is dead.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.510
Good has a future.

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:19.043
Nice doesn't have a future
because nice ends up with gulags.

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:21.160
- Damn, that's a good line.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.730
Okay, last question.

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:27.170
You Tweeted today, a simple,
quite insightful equation

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.027
saying "Imagine that every
unit f of fame you picked up,

01:17:33.027 --> 01:17:35.690
"s stalkers and h haters".

01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:37.590
So, I imagine s and h are dependent

01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:39.520
on your path to fame,
perhaps a little bit--

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.700
- Well, it's not a simple.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.490
I mean, people always take
these things literally

01:17:42.490 --> 01:17:45.190
when you have like 280
characters to explain yourself.

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:49.520
- So you mean that's not a mathematical--

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.560
- No, there's no law.
- Oh, okay, all right.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.040
- I just, I put the word
imagine because I still

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.310
have a mathematicians
desire for precision.

01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:57.860
- Yes.
- Imagine that this were true.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.130
- But there was a beautiful way to imagine

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:02.585
that there is a law that
has those variables in it--

01:18:02.585 --> 01:18:03.418
- [Eric] Yeah, yeah.

01:18:03.418 --> 01:18:06.740
- And you've become
quite famous these days,

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:10.660
so how do you yourself
optimize that equation with the

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.800
peculiar kind of fame that
you've gathered along the way?

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.780
- I wanna be kinder.

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:17.420
I wanna be kinder to myself,
I wanna kinder to others,

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.253
I wanna be able to have heart,

01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:24.500
compassion and these things
are really important,

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:29.010
and I have a pretty spectrumy
kind of approach to analysis.

01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:30.510
I'm quite literal.

01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:33.160
I can go full Rain Man on
you at any given moment.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.750
No, I can, I can.

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:36.500
It's facultative autism, if you like,

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.440
and people are gonna get angry

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.740
because they want autism
to be respected, but.

01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:44.323
When you see me coding or
you see me doing mathematics,

01:18:46.031 --> 01:18:48.431
you know, I speak with
speech apnea, (stutters),

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.480
be right down for dinner, you know?

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.313
- [Lex] Yeah.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.240
- We have to try to integrate ourselves

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.410
in those tensions between, you know,

01:18:57.410 --> 01:19:00.700
it's sort of back to us as
a worker and us as a soul.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:05.600
Many of us are optimizing one
at the expense of the other.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.280
And I struggle with social
media and I struggle with people

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.580
making threats against our
families and I struggle

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.870
with just how much pain people are in.

01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:18.863
And if there's one message I
would like to push out there,

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.380
you're responsible, everybody, all of us,

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.860
myself included, with struggling.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.100
Struggle mightily because it's nobody

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.820
else's job to do your struggle for you.

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.500
Now with that said, if you're
struggling and you're trying,

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.570
and you're trying to figure
out how to better yourself

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:38.150
and where you've failed, where
you've let down your family,

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:40.873
your friends, your workers,
all this kind of stuff,

01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:44.043
give yourself a break, you know?

01:19:45.004 --> 01:19:48.320
If it's not working out, I
have a lifelong relationship

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.330
with failure and success.

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:53.320
There's been no period
of my life where both

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.940
haven't been present
in one form or another.

01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.780
And, I do wish to say that a lot

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:01.230
of the times people
think this is glamorous.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:03.203
I'm about to go, you know,
do a show with Sam Harris.

01:20:03.203 --> 01:20:05.150
- Yeah.
- People are gonna listen

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:07.310
in on two guys having a
conversation on stage.

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.390
It's completely crazy when I'm
always trying to figure out

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:12.330
how to make sure that those
people get maximum value

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:15.100
and that's why I'm doing this podcast,

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:18.203
you know, just give yourself a break.

01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:20.530
You owe us your struggle.

01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:22.920
You don't owe your
family or your coworkers

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.843
or your lovers or your
family members success.

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.710
As long as you're in there and
you're picking yourself up,

01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:33.660
recognize that this new
situation with the economy

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:37.100
that doesn't have the juice
to sustain our institutions,

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.730
has caused the people
who've risen to the top

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:43.420
of those institutions to
get quite brutal and cruel.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.130
Everybody is lying at the moment.

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:46.823
Nobody is really truth teller.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.120
Try to keep your humanity about you.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.840
Try to recognize that if you're failing,

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.380
if things aren't where you
want them to be and you're

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.670
struggling and you're trying to figure out

01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.460
what you're doing wrong,
what you could do,

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:01.320
it's not necessarily all your fault.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.000
We are in a global situation.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.090
I have not met the people who are honest,

01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:08.270
kind, good, successful.

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:12.770
Nobody that I've met is
checking all the boxes.

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:14.470
Nobody's getting all 10s.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:17.370
So, I just think that's
an important message

01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:18.790
that doesn't get pushed out enough.

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:21.810
Either people wanna
hold society responsible

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:24.020
for their failures,
which is not reasonable.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.160
You have to struggle, you have to try.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.950
Or they wanna say you're 100%
responsible for your failures,

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.393
which is total nonsense.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.930
- Beautifully put.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.400
Eric, thank you so much for talking today.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.783
- Thanks for having me, buddy.
