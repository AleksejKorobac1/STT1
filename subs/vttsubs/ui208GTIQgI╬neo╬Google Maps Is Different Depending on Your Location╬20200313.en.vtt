00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.520
The question of what we should believe and
what we shouldn’t can be somewhat arbitrary.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.660
And even though we might have a spontaneous
gut feeling of whether something is believable

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.490
or not, can we really explain our reasoning
for it?

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.120
If you go on Google Maps in Japan, the region
between South Korea and Japan is shown as

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.440
the “Sea of Japan”.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.970
However if you’re using Google Maps inside
South Korea, it will instead appear by the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.890
name “East Sea”.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.570
Two names for the same body of water on the
same site.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.800
Which name is displayed depends on the location
that you're browsing from.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.229
For the past two decades Japan and South Korea
have been in a dispute over what the sea should

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.960
be called.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.649
While South Koreans refer to the waters that
surround their country as the West Sea, South

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.000
Sea and East Sea; in Japan this body of water
is traditionally called the Sea of Japan,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.780
a name that also is more internationally accepted.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.439
The arguments on both sides are complex - South
Korea argues that the name “Sea of Japan”

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.119
was pushed during the time Korea was under
Japanese occupation, meaning South Korea couldn't

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.299
internationally dispute it.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.950
Japan on the other hand argues that the name
has been used long before the occupation and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.850
has been the historical internationally recognised
name.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.030
In international politics, there are many
disputes over naming things.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.950
But when there are arguments about names of
regions or entire seas, things that are essential

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.260
to normal communication, how can we neutrally
talk about it?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.570
Cartographers have had the challenging job
of handling naming disputes like this for

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.580
centuries.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.750
And there are a few ways to deal with this.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.790
Either by choosing one of the names, by printing
both versions next to each other, as two equal

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.740
alternatives or as a mainly accepted one and
an alternative name, or by simply leaving

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.500
the disputed area completely blank.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.590
Google however chooses a different approach.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.870
Google Maps avoids such conflict by showing
different maps to different people.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.520
An approach only possible for an online map
service.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.260
A similar situation exists in the middle east,
between Arab countries and Iran.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.890
On the international version of Google Maps
you will find the “Persian Gulf”.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:53.300
However if you zoom in more, you will also
see the name “Arabian Gulf”.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.770
Whereas Iran argues that the sea has consistently
been called Persian Gulf throughout history.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.120
Conflicts like these may seem absurd, but
between two rivalling countries like Iran

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.080
and Saudi Arabia, both claiming a leading
role in the region, the name has a tremendous

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.790
cultural and political significance.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.870
In many countries it is against the law to
publish maps that contradict the official

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.560
government maps.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.150
Therefore Google has the choice of either
adapting to these laws or to not offer Google

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.340
Maps in those countries.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.870
The fact that some countries regulate maps
by law is an indicator of how politically

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.960
significant they can be, as they can either
confirm or put to question geographical claims.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.130
Another example of this is China and India.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.950
Both countries claim this area which is designated
as "Arunachal Pradesh" by India, which governs

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.950
it.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.350
And as long as you are using the site from
an Indian domain, Google Maps will show it

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.070
as an Indian state.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.460
China, on the other hand calls the area southern
Tibet and Chinese Google users will see the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.440
area as a part of China.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.170
In both countries Google doesn’t show the
users that there is a border conflict.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.840
Only when using the site outside of both nations
the map indicates the controversy by rendering

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.480
dotted border lines.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.070
The same applies to Kashmir, an area which
is in parts claimed by India, China as well

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.720
as Pakistan.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.350
When Google is used in China and India the
official maps of their respective governments

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.230
are shown.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.330
Rendering the border as a continuous line
conceals the dispute and makes the borderline

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.110
seem internationally recognised.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.750
While Google has to obey the countries laws,
they also don't want to anger customers in

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.570
those countries.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.400
Leaving out growth markets like China or India
would be a huge economic disadvantage.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.370
Now, the fact that Google even offers a map
in China is a bit surprising, considering

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.580
that the company is in a long disagreement
with the authorities.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.180
In 2010, Google decided to relocate its services
from mainland China to Hong Kong, in order

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.850
to avoid the Chinese firewall, which required
them to censor search results.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.600
Ever since, Google has become rather insignificant
in China, but the company still keeps offering

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.220
their map service.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.500
Both in the conflict with India, as well as
with Taiwan, Google Maps in China corresponds

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.380
with the official government viewpoint.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.370
And the map even shows the 10-Dash Line.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.850
A line that originates from a Chinese map
from 1947 and is used by the country to justify

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.510
its claim on several islands in the South
Chinese Sea.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.640
This area is disputed by many countries.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.420
The cause of the conflicts are the rich fishing
grounds, ressources in the sea as well as

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.090
the military importance of controlling the
area.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.120
If countries convincingly argue a claim over
a sea, they can use that to justify exclusive

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.780
rights.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.060
The crimean peninsula is disputed between
Ukraine and Russia.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.280
The conflict broke out in 2014 and ever since
a controversial referendum, Russia regards

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.970
Crimea as its territory.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.650
A large part of the international community
however considers this a violation of international

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.960
law.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.450
While the international version of google
shows a dotted line, the Ukrainian version

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.590
doesn’t immediately show this.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.060
Only when zooming in much closer we see the
line.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.640
Russian Google Maps however shows Crimea as
part of Russia.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.550
Google is in the difficult position where
there is not really any approach to draw a

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.180
map that would not offend somebody.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.550
And even though it may be a power that Google
doesn’t want, it has to deal with the responsibilities

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.389
that come with it.

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.050
If Google draws a straight border in an area
that is disputed - Google is creating facts

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.340
that do have strong impact on the real situation
on the ground.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.900
Now let’s take a look at how another website
handles this.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.810
The collaborative Wikipedia project also struggles
to neutrally portray border conflicts.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.620
There are long-lasting discussions between
the authors on the correct way of dealing

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.740
with disputes.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.080
In the Crimean conflict, this has even led
to the peninsula being shown as Russian territory

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.060
on the Russian language wikipedia, while the
Ukrainian site claims it as part of Ukraine.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.960
In both countries, there is information available
about the dispute, yet how the borders are

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.180
rendered changes from time to time.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.490
In both countries the articles are available
and Wikipedia wasn't blocked.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.740
The fact that Wikipedia would show disputes,
even if that puts the site at risk of being

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.750
blocked can be seen by them switching their
web protocol.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.810
In the past, countries were able to censor
individual articles from the site.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.120
For example, sexually explicit content was
blocked in Turkey and an article about Marijruhanna

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.280
was blocked in Russia.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.120
But since Wikipedia changed to the new encrypted
protocol, the only censorship option countries

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.590
have is to block Wikipedia in int’s entirety,
not just single articles.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.570
And Wikipedia is currently blocked in China.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.669
Whether Google wants it or not, since they
are the main player in online maps, they have

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:09.270
enormous power and responsibility.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.639
Because the map that Google shows will be
the map that a lot of people believe.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:16.770
Maps should always be viewed critically.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.300
Not only since Google.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.449
It is important to recognise that even things
which at first glance seem to be objective

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:25.940
truths may be more subjective.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.750
Behind every map, also Google Maps, there
is an approach.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.560
And that doesn’t mean they are bad maps,
just that we should view them critically,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.110
since the decisions mapmakers make affect
our view of the world every day.
