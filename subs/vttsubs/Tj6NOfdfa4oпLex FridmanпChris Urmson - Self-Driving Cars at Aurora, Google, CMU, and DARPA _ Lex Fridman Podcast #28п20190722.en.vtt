00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.370 align:start position:0%
course right like why would you go do
something<00:02:32.480><c> you</c><00:02:32.570><c> thought</c><00:02:32.720><c> was</c><00:02:32.780><c> impossible</c>

gonna be able to do it we didn't know if
 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
gonna be able to do it we didn't know if
we'd<00:02:38.300><c> be</c><00:02:38.330><c> able</c><00:02:38.420><c> to</c><00:02:38.600><c> do</c><00:02:38.870><c> it</c><00:02:39.050><c> the</c><00:02:39.650><c> first</c><00:02:40.040><c> time</c>

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to do it the first time
 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.140 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to do it the first time
turns<00:02:43.130><c> out</c><00:02:43.250><c> we</c><00:02:43.370><c> couldn't</c>

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 align:start position:0%
turns out we couldn't
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.869 align:start position:0%
turns out we couldn't
that<00:02:46.170><c> yeah</c><00:02:47.170><c> I</c><00:02:47.200><c> guess</c><00:02:47.620><c> you</c><00:02:47.980><c> have</c><00:02:48.159><c> to</c><00:02:48.340><c> I</c><00:02:48.370><c> think</c>

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
that yeah I guess you have to I think
 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
that yeah I guess you have to I think
there's<00:02:49.030><c> a</c><00:02:49.120><c> certain</c><00:02:49.890><c> benefit</c><00:02:50.890><c> to</c><00:02:51.250><c> naivete</c>

there's a certain benefit to naivete
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
there's a certain benefit to naivete
right<00:02:52.870><c> that</c><00:02:53.140><c> if</c><00:02:53.319><c> you</c><00:02:53.409><c> don't</c><00:02:53.590><c> know</c><00:02:53.799><c> how</c><00:02:54.189><c> hard</c>

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 align:start position:0%
right that if you don't know how hard

right that if you don't know how hard
something<00:02:54.670><c> really</c><00:02:55.090><c> is</c><00:02:55.239><c> you</c><00:02:55.599><c> you</c><00:02:55.810><c> try</c>

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 align:start position:0%
that means it was out in the desert so
 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.490 align:start position:0%
that means it was out in the desert so
you<00:03:43.540><c> get</c><00:03:43.659><c> really</c><00:03:43.870><c> good</c><00:03:44.019><c> GPS</c><00:03:45.930><c> you</c><00:03:46.930><c> know</c><00:03:46.989><c> so</c><00:03:47.290><c> that</c>

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 align:start position:0%
you get really good GPS you know so that
 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
you get really good GPS you know so that

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 align:start position:0%
that went in you know we could map it
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
that went in you know we could map it

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
to get the vehicle so that we could

now what have you learned from reading
about<00:05:23.509><c> leadership</c><00:05:23.869><c> I</c><00:05:24.459><c> think</c><00:05:25.459><c> there's</c><00:05:25.610><c> a</c>

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 align:start position:0%
about leadership I think there's a
 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
about leadership I think there's a
couple<00:05:25.849><c> things</c><00:05:26.089><c> one</c><00:05:26.449><c> is</c><00:05:26.719><c> you</c><00:05:27.709><c> know</c><00:05:28.360><c> go</c><00:05:29.360><c> and</c><00:05:29.479><c> try</c>

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:29.689 align:start position:0%
couple things one is you know go and try
 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.179 align:start position:0%
couple things one is you know go and try
those<00:05:29.869><c> really</c><00:05:30.199><c> hard</c><00:05:30.379><c> things</c><00:05:30.709><c> that</c><00:05:31.009><c> that's</c>

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:31.189 align:start position:0%
those really hard things that that's
 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
those really hard things that that's
where<00:05:31.490><c> there</c><00:05:31.669><c> is</c><00:05:31.819><c> an</c><00:05:32.059><c> incredible</c><00:05:32.959><c> opportunity</c>

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 align:start position:0%
where there is an incredible opportunity
 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.029 align:start position:0%
where there is an incredible opportunity
I<00:05:34.550><c> think</c><00:05:35.089><c> the</c><00:05:35.209><c> other</c><00:05:35.389><c> big</c><00:05:35.479><c> one</c><00:05:35.990><c> though</c><00:05:36.289><c> is</c><00:05:36.649><c> to</c>

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
I think the other big one though is to
 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.999 align:start position:0%
I think the other big one though is to
see<00:05:37.369><c> people</c><00:05:38.059><c> for</c><00:05:38.269><c> who</c><00:05:38.300><c> they</c><00:05:38.599><c> can</c><00:05:38.659><c> be</c><00:05:38.929><c> not</c><00:05:39.589><c> who</c>

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 align:start position:0%

know this is a smart guy who's has a lot
 

00:21:28.309 --> 00:21:31.029 align:start position:0%
know this is a smart guy who's has a lot

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.350 align:start position:0%
a Tesla's a self-driving car and that
 

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.659 align:start position:0%
a Tesla's a self-driving car and that
why<00:21:33.529><c> shouldn't</c><00:21:33.830><c> people</c><00:21:33.919><c> be</c><00:21:34.190><c> sleeping</c><00:21:34.580><c> in</c>

00:21:34.659 --> 00:21:34.669 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't people be sleeping in
 

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:37.419 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't people be sleeping in
their<00:21:34.789><c> Tesla</c><00:21:35.149><c> there's</c><00:21:35.840><c> like</c><00:21:35.960><c> well</c><00:21:36.429><c> because</c>

00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:37.429 align:start position:0%
their Tesla there's like well because
 

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:39.490 align:start position:0%
their Tesla there's like well because
it's<00:21:37.580><c> not</c><00:21:37.730><c> a</c><00:21:37.760><c> self-driving</c><00:21:38.179><c> car</c><00:21:38.419><c> and</c><00:21:38.899><c> it</c><00:21:39.350><c> is</c>

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:39.500 align:start position:0%
it's not a self-driving car and it is
 

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.909 align:start position:0%
it's not a self-driving car and it is
not<00:21:39.770><c> intended</c><00:21:40.520><c> to</c><00:21:40.700><c> be</c><00:21:40.909><c> and</c><00:21:41.240><c> you</c><00:21:42.110><c> know</c><00:21:42.140><c> these</c>

00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
not intended to be and you know these
 

00:21:42.919 --> 00:21:45.310 align:start position:0%
not intended to be and you know these
people<00:21:43.330><c> will</c><00:21:44.330><c> almost</c><00:21:44.450><c> certainly</c><00:21:44.690><c> you</c><00:21:45.200><c> know</c>

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
people will almost certainly you know
 

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.870 align:start position:0%
people will almost certainly you know
die<00:21:46.100><c> at</c><00:21:46.340><c> some</c><00:21:46.580><c> point</c><00:21:46.960><c> or</c><00:21:48.309><c> hurt</c><00:21:49.309><c> other</c><00:21:49.490><c> people</c>

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
die at some point or hurt other people
and<00:21:50.539><c> so</c><00:21:50.720><c> we</c><00:21:50.870><c> need</c><00:21:51.230><c> to</c><00:21:51.320><c> really</c><00:21:51.710><c> be</c><00:21:51.830><c> thoughtful</c>

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.130 align:start position:0%
and so we need to really be thoughtful
 

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.769 align:start position:0%
and so we need to really be thoughtful
about<00:21:52.340><c> how</c><00:21:52.610><c> that</c><00:21:52.669><c> technology</c><00:21:52.940><c> is</c><00:21:53.390><c> described</c>

00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:53.779 align:start position:0%
about how that technology is described
 

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
about how that technology is described

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:57.049 align:start position:0%
and brought to market I also think that
 

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
and brought to market I also think that
because<00:21:57.639><c> of</c><00:21:58.639><c> the</c><00:21:58.850><c> economic</c><00:21:59.270><c> issue</c>

00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
because of the economic issue
 

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.450 align:start position:0%
because of the economic issue
you<00:22:00.139><c> know</c><00:22:00.230><c> Iike</c><00:22:00.500><c> my</c><00:22:00.620><c> economic</c><00:22:01.130><c> challenges</c><00:22:01.399><c> we</c>

00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
again the economics are very different

you know divergent technology so you
 

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:34.729 align:start position:0%
you know divergent technology so you

what you should do at that point if you
 

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.610 align:start position:0%
what you should do at that point if you

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:10.630 align:start position:0%
time is drive the cost out of that so
 

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
time is drive the cost out of that so

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:12.310 align:start position:0%
you can get it on as many vehicles as
 

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.670 align:start position:0%
you can get it on as many vehicles as

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
you think it's possible to create a

you think it's possible to create a

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:15.460 align:start position:0%

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%

but<00:40:23.359><c> do</c><00:40:23.599><c> you</c><00:40:23.839><c> think</c><00:40:23.900><c> about</c><00:40:24.230><c> how</c><00:40:24.470><c> we</c><00:40:24.499><c> solve</c><00:40:24.859><c> that</c>

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:24.950 align:start position:0%
but do you think about how we solve that
 

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
but do you think about how we solve that
problem<00:40:25.400><c> yeah</c><00:40:26.089><c> I</c><00:40:26.119><c> think</c><00:40:26.269><c> I</c><00:40:26.509><c> think</c><00:40:26.749><c> there's</c>

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:27.490 align:start position:0%
problem yeah I think I think there's
 

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.710 align:start position:0%
problem yeah I think I think there's
there's<00:40:28.490><c> I</c><00:40:28.700><c> think</c><00:40:29.119><c> that</c><00:40:29.359><c> was</c><00:40:29.450><c> actually</c>

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
there's I think that was actually
 

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.509 align:start position:0%
there's I think that was actually
there's<00:40:30.019><c> two</c><00:40:30.079><c> different</c><00:40:30.499><c> concepts</c><00:40:31.160><c> there</c><00:40:31.339><c> so</c>

00:40:31.509 --> 00:40:31.519 align:start position:0%
there's two different concepts there so
 

00:40:31.519 --> 00:40:35.380 align:start position:0%
there's two different concepts there so
one<00:40:31.789><c> is</c><00:40:32.289><c> am</c><00:40:33.289><c> I</c><00:40:33.470><c> worried</c><00:40:33.920><c> that</c><00:40:34.089><c> because</c><00:40:35.089><c> these</c>

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:35.390 align:start position:0%
one is am I worried that because these
 

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.029 align:start position:0%
one is am I worried that because these

00:40:37.029 --> 00:40:37.039 align:start position:0%
vehicles are self-driving people kind of
 

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:38.380 align:start position:0%
vehicles are self-driving people kind of

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:38.390 align:start position:0%
step in the road and take advantage of
 

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:42.249 align:start position:0%
step in the road and take advantage of

00:40:42.249 --> 00:40:42.259 align:start position:0%
them and I've heard this and I don't
 

00:40:42.259 --> 00:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
them and I've heard this and I don't
really<00:40:42.859><c> believe</c><00:40:43.519><c> it</c><00:40:43.759><c> because</c><00:40:44.089><c> if</c><00:40:44.900><c> I'm</c><00:40:45.079><c> driving</c>

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
really believe it because if I'm driving
 

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.660 align:start position:0%
really believe it because if I'm driving
down<00:40:45.559><c> the</c><00:40:45.680><c> road</c><00:40:45.859><c> and</c><00:40:45.890><c> somebody</c><00:40:46.220><c> steps</c><00:40:46.579><c> in</c>

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:46.670 align:start position:0%
down the road and somebody steps in
 

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.269 align:start position:0%
down the road and somebody steps in
front<00:40:46.759><c> of</c><00:40:46.910><c> me</c><00:40:46.970><c> I'm</c><00:40:47.059><c> going</c><00:40:47.239><c> to</c><00:40:47.329><c> stop</c><00:40:48.099><c> right</c><00:40:49.099><c> like</c>

00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
front of me I'm going to stop right like
 

00:40:49.279 --> 00:40:53.229 align:start position:0%
front of me I'm going to stop right like
a<00:40:50.079><c> even</c><00:40:51.079><c> if</c><00:40:51.170><c> I'm</c><00:40:51.259><c> annoyed</c><00:40:51.700><c> I'm</c><00:40:52.700><c> not</c><00:40:53.029><c> going</c><00:40:53.180><c> to</c>

00:40:53.229 --> 00:40:53.239 align:start position:0%
a even if I'm annoyed I'm not going to
 

00:40:53.239 --> 00:40:54.489 align:start position:0%
a even if I'm annoyed I'm not going to
just<00:40:53.390><c> drive</c><00:40:53.599><c> through</c><00:40:53.749><c> a</c><00:40:53.839><c> person</c><00:40:54.140><c> stood</c><00:40:54.319><c> on</c><00:40:54.410><c> the</c>

00:40:54.489 --> 00:40:54.499 align:start position:0%
just drive through a person stood on the
 

00:40:54.499 --> 00:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
just drive through a person stood on the
road<00:40:54.650><c> right</c><00:40:55.069><c> and</c><00:40:56.200><c> so</c><00:40:57.200><c> I</c><00:40:57.619><c> think</c><00:40:57.829><c> today</c><00:40:58.460><c> people</c>

00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
road right and so I think today people
 

00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:00.700 align:start position:0%
road right and so I think today people
can<00:40:59.539><c> take</c><00:40:59.660><c> advantage</c><00:40:59.839><c> of</c><00:41:00.170><c> this</c><00:41:00.289><c> and</c><00:41:00.499><c> you</c><00:41:00.589><c> and</c>

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:00.710 align:start position:0%
can take advantage of this and you and
 

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.979 align:start position:0%
can take advantage of this and you and
you<00:41:00.829><c> do</c><00:41:01.039><c> see</c><00:41:01.220><c> some</c><00:41:01.430><c> people</c><00:41:01.460><c> do</c><00:41:01.880><c> it</c><00:41:02.029><c> I</c><00:41:02.180><c> guess</c>

00:41:02.979 --> 00:41:02.989 align:start position:0%
you do see some people do it I guess
 

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:04.390 align:start position:0%
you do see some people do it I guess
there's<00:41:03.200><c> an</c><00:41:03.289><c> incremental</c><00:41:03.799><c> risk</c><00:41:03.980><c> because</c>

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's an incremental risk because
 

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.979 align:start position:0%
there's an incremental risk because
maybe<00:41:04.700><c> they</c><00:41:04.910><c> have</c><00:41:05.029><c> lower</c><00:41:05.269><c> confidence</c><00:41:05.569><c> that</c>

00:41:05.979 --> 00:41:05.989 align:start position:0%
maybe they have lower confidence that
 

00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:07.029 align:start position:0%
maybe they have lower confidence that
I'm<00:41:06.079><c> going</c><00:41:06.259><c> to</c><00:41:06.289><c> see</c><00:41:06.470><c> them</c><00:41:06.619><c> than</c><00:41:06.799><c> they</c><00:41:06.890><c> might</c>

00:41:07.029 --> 00:41:07.039 align:start position:0%
I'm going to see them than they might
 

00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:09.489 align:start position:0%
I'm going to see them than they might
have<00:41:07.099><c> for</c><00:41:07.999><c> an</c><00:41:08.509><c> automated</c><00:41:08.869><c> vehicle</c><00:41:09.289><c> and</c><00:41:09.410><c> so</c>

00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:09.499 align:start position:0%
have for an automated vehicle and so
 

00:41:09.499 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
have for an automated vehicle and so
maybe<00:41:09.769><c> that</c><00:41:09.920><c> shifts</c><00:41:10.400><c> it</c><00:41:10.489><c> a</c><00:41:10.549><c> little</c><00:41:10.730><c> bit</c><00:41:10.940><c> I</c>

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:11.230 align:start position:0%
maybe that shifts it a little bit I
 

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.059 align:start position:0%
maybe that shifts it a little bit I
think<00:41:12.230><c> people</c><00:41:12.499><c> don't</c><00:41:12.589><c> want</c><00:41:12.769><c> to</c><00:41:12.829><c> get</c><00:41:12.920><c> hit</c><00:41:13.039><c> by</c>

00:41:13.059 --> 00:41:13.069 align:start position:0%
think people don't want to get hit by
 

00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:16.630 align:start position:0%
think people don't want to get hit by
cars<00:41:13.450><c> and</c><00:41:14.450><c> so</c><00:41:14.779><c> I</c><00:41:14.809><c> think</c><00:41:15.410><c> that</c><00:41:15.650><c> I'm</c><00:41:16.069><c> not</c><00:41:16.279><c> that</c>

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.220 align:start position:0%

the<00:41:32.239><c> technology</c><00:41:32.809><c> pipeline</c><00:41:33.259><c> I</c><00:41:33.470><c> think</c><00:41:34.099><c> that</c>

00:41:34.329 --> 00:41:34.339 align:start position:0%
the technology pipeline I think that
 

00:41:34.339 --> 00:41:37.390 align:start position:0%
the technology pipeline I think that
you're<00:41:34.910><c> right</c><00:41:35.119><c> that's</c><00:41:35.329><c> tricky</c><00:41:35.900><c> I</c><00:41:36.220><c> don't</c><00:41:37.220><c> think</c>

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
you're right that's tricky I don't think
 

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.989 align:start position:0%
you're right that's tricky I don't think
it's<00:41:37.519><c> necessarily</c><00:41:38.029><c> I</c><00:41:39.549><c> think</c><00:41:40.549><c> the</c><00:41:40.609><c> algorithm</c>

00:41:40.989 --> 00:41:40.999 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily I think the algorithm
 

00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:42.190 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily I think the algorithm
people<00:41:41.269><c> use</c><00:41:41.420><c> for</c><00:41:41.569><c> this</c><00:41:41.630><c> is</c><00:41:41.749><c> pretty</c><00:41:41.900><c> simple</c>

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
people use for this is pretty simple
 

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.170 align:start position:0%
people use for this is pretty simple
Yeah<00:41:42.799><c> right</c><00:41:43.339><c> it's</c><00:41:43.700><c> kind</c><00:41:43.849><c> of</c><00:41:43.880><c> just</c><00:41:43.970><c> move</c>

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:44.180 align:start position:0%
Yeah right it's kind of just move
 

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.460 align:start position:0%
Yeah right it's kind of just move
forward<00:41:44.450><c> slowly</c><00:41:44.539><c> and</c><00:41:44.839><c> if</c><00:41:44.900><c> somebody's</c><00:41:45.200><c> really</c>

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:45.470 align:start position:0%
forward slowly and if somebody's really
 

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.329 align:start position:0%
forward slowly and if somebody's really
close<00:41:45.680><c> and</c><00:41:45.859><c> stop</c><00:41:46.420><c> and</c><00:41:47.619><c> and</c><00:41:48.619><c> I</c><00:41:48.739><c> think</c><00:41:49.009><c> that</c><00:41:49.160><c> that</c>

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:49.339 align:start position:0%
close and stop and and I think that that
 

00:41:49.339 --> 00:41:51.819 align:start position:0%
close and stop and and I think that that

00:41:51.819 --> 00:41:51.829 align:start position:0%
probably can be replicated pretty pretty
