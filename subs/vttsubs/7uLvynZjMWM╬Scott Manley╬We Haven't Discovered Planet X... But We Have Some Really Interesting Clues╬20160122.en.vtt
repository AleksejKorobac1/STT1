00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.760
Hello it's Scott Manley here, today I want to talk about Planet X.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.800
So Planet X is back in the news

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.920
you might've seen headlines that said "Planet X has been Discovered."

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.140
"There is another planet in the outer solar system."

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.520
Okay, hasn't been discovered.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:30.860
What we do have is some really interesting evidence  based upon observations of other objects that could be explained by the existence of another planet.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.880
So let's rewind the clock a little.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.260
Couple of years ago there was a discovery announced of a new object called 2012 VP113.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.480
It was actually nicknamed Biden because of the VP in it's name.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.000
And this was an object which the perihelion was 80 AU and its aphelion was way out over a couple of hundred AU.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.560
So this in a highly eccentric orbit in the outer solar system.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.260
Interestingly it's perihelion didn't come anywhere near Neptune.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.740
Now Neptune's orbit is 30 AU

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.660
You instantly have a problem with these.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.600
How do you put an object out into that orbit

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.540
because normally things get kicked into these orbits by having a close encounter with a planet

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.040
but if you're not coming down any closer than 80 AU you're not getting anywhere near Neptune to get kicked off.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.980
Now the authors of this paper, they wanted to think about origins and so they looked at it

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.880
They also looked at another example of a similar object- one called Sedna.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.620
Now Sedna goes out to yet further still, I believe.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.780
And it was discovered by a guy called Mike Brown.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.900
Who we'll hear more about later.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.320
Now the authors of this paper, they said

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.240
Well wait a second, we noticed an interesting correlation

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.120
They noticed that the argument of perihelion of these two objects

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.100
were actually pretty close together, the orbits were roughly aligned.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.760
Then they looked at some other objects that had a perihelion outside Neptune's orbit

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.520
and very large semimajor axis

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.140
So they looked for perihelion greater than 30 and semimajor axis greater than 150

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.420
so these were pretty eccentric orbits.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.440
And they noticed that all of these were very much aligned in the sky unusually so.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.080
If you just had these things floating out in space doing these orbits

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.120
for billions of years we would've expected them to kind've been randomly oriented across the sky

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.260
because of lots of just random perturbations.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.640
To have them in one area of the sky said

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.020
Perhaps there's something shepherding them.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.780
Regardless the original 2014 paper that was about the 2012 VP113

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.420
They kind've mention that maybe a planet could herd these things using something called the cosine mechanism

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.120
which is a fancy gravitational effect which occurs due to periodicities[?] basically.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.960
Causes an oscillation of the orbit.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.480
They didn't go too deeply into it

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.080
But last year, January 2015, a paper was published where somebody had gone really deeply into it.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.120
They said "We think this could be due to two planets in the outer solar system herding these objects using the cosine mechanism.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.900
Again, hey, great.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.420
That was all very good.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.600
And it got a little of attention.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.160
But then this new paper by Mike Brown, the guy that discovered Sedna

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.920
He actually set out to disprove this hypothesis.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.640
That was good science. Go and take a look some prediction and try to disprove it.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.860
So first of all they pointed out that if it was a cosine mechanism you'd expect two groupings pointed in opposite directions.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.700
We actually only see that in one direction.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.360
Secondly he was concerned that of the 13 objects that some of them might've been affected by Neptune.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.660
So what they did they took the data set of the 13 and they tested the orbit backwards and forwards

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.560
in time just to check to see if any of them could seriously be affected by Neptune.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.440
So they actually threw away some of the objects and were left with six.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.680
Then when they actually calculated probability of these things being aligned,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.120
given they would expect them to be random, they came up with odds of something like

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.780
0.07% chance of this happening randomly.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.520
So that was a relatively strong result.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:49.760
So they kinda wound things forward and tried to come up with an object which would herd these things using some sort of mechanism obviously.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.420
They came up with the idea of a 10 Earth-mass planet

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.900
with a perihelion of 200 AU and aphelion could be further out

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.340
This thing would orbit for tens of thousands of years they said for a single orbit.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.160
And they've come up with an approximate idea of where to look in the sky.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:20.320
But it's a huge area of the sky and something ten Earth-masses at that distance can be very cold, very hard to see.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.560
A few years ago the WISE Spacecraft, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, did photograph the entire sky in infrared,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.380
and they excluded, they specifically excluded any planets that were larger than Saturn.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.540
So we know it can't be as big as Saturn, which is fine because 10 Earth-masses is smaller than Saturn.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.640
So anyway, they're gonna get telescope time, they're gonna look for it, maybe they'll find it.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.420
Or maybe somebody else will come up with a better explanation for why these things appear aligned .

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.160
Maybe it is just a chance.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.520
Maybe there's some sort of observational affect which we haven't realized.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.220
These are all possibilities, and it would be good science to prove or disprove this thing.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.420
Now if it was to be discovered, this wouldn't be the first planet to be discovered by a mathematical prediction.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.160
That would be Neptune, of course.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.520
You see, funnily enough if you think about it, there's only two planets that have been discovered

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.280
after the classical planets in the solar system, Uranus and Neptune.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.400
Uranus was discovered with a telescope ,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.840
Neptune was predicted by Le Verrier.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:37.120
When he finally got somebody to look through a telescope at the region in the sky he wanted, they discovered it, that night.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:46.240
So... 50%, half of the planets in our solar system have been discovered since the invention of the telescope.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.780
have been discovered by mathematics

00:06:51.900 --> 00:07:00.540
It's not such a ridiculous notion that the gravitational effects of an object could be used to infer it.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:08.600
And therefore it's worth taking this very seriously but it's not worth saying there is a 10th planet out there absolutely for sure

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.200
Because it's a long way from being proved.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.060
But it'll be a great journey to find out, there will be interesting math done, whatever

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.800
I'm Scott Manley, fly safe.
