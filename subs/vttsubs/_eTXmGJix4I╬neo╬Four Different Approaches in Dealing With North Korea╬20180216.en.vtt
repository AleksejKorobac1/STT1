00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.020
On February 8, just one day before the start
of the Olympic Winter Games in South Korea

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.110
- North Korea held a military parade showing
off their latest rockets.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.840
And based on the timing of this, it is clear
that this is meant to send a message to the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.070
outside world.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.130
Nonetheless, the country also is gaining more
knowledge every year and is making rapid progress

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.279
in their missile development.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:34.699
"So between 1994 and 2007 North korea did
16 missile tests and 1 nuclear test.

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:42.370
From January 2008 to September of 2016 they
did 80 missile tests and 4 nuclear tests.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:54.190
And at the rate they are going in 4 years
of Trump they're gonna be well over 100."

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.969
Even though North Korea was not part of the
eastern bloc and it’s collective defense

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.129
treaty knows as the warsaw pact.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.880
As a socialist state, China and the Soviet
Union naturally have always been it’s strongest

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.880
allies.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.450
In the 1950s, the North Koreans asked them
for help in developing their own nuclear weapons,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.680
but both countries refused.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.710
The soviets did however help the North Koreans
in building their first nuclear research reactor.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.359
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the
alliance became almost worthless at a stroke

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.950
and the North Koreans saw the threat of their
country being absolutely powerless against

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.950
the outside.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.670
They then used the reactor to reprocess plutonium
to create nuclear weapons.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.850
And they announced to leave the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons Treaty that allowed international

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.350
observers to inspect the countries reactors.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.719
Ever since, there have been 4 different US
presidents in power and all of them tried

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.039
different approaches in keeping North Korea
from developing nuclear weapons.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.670
In Order to keep the North Koreans from leaving
the Treaty on Non-Proliferation, Bill Clinton

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.250
offered to in return suspend some of the military
exercises done by the US army together with

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.789
South Korea.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.000
The North Koreans accepted to negotiate, and
both countries worked out an Agreed Framework.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.019
The main ingredient of this deal was for the
North Koreans to shut down their Yongbon reactor.

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.909
Which they officially used as an energy reactor,
but was not connected to the power grid and

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.680
was suspected to be used to create Plutonium.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.620
According to the Framework, the reactor should
be replaced by two light-water reactors and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.849
as a compensation for the theoretical loss
in shutting down the Yongbon reactor, the

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.680
Koreans were promised 500 thousand tons of
heavy fuel-oil each year.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.720
And the Clinton administration was open to
accepting and recognizing North Korea in case

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.000
of implementation of the full framework.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.720
"The united states and international inspectors
will carefully monitor North Korea to make

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.909
sure it keeps its commitments.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.099
Only as it does so will North Korea fully
join the community of Nations."

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.140
But Implementation of the Agreement was slow.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.950
Intelligence findings revealed that North
Korea had violated the deal and started working

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.410
on another method of developing nuclear material
through uranium enrichment.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.739
The new incoming President was opposed to
the Agreement reached by his successor.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.560
When George Bush became President he went
for a much harder course.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.879
In his first State of the Union Adress in
January 2000, he put North Korea on the Axis

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.060
of Evil, rendering them as an enemy of the
US.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.709
"States like these and their terrorist allies
constitute an Axis of Evil arming to threaten

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.189
the peace of the world."

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.060
His administration terminated the supply of
fuel-oil and the North Koreans responded by

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.439
kicking out International Observers and resuming
their weapon programs.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.189
And they left the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty in 2003, which freed them from any

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.080
foreign controls on their nuclear sites.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.819
The bush administration was under pressure
to react and started to negotiate again with

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.620
the Six-Party-Talks.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.709
Many of the things that were essential to
Clintons Agreed Framework of 1994 were now

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.700
re-negotiated.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.080
The talks didn’t lead to results - and the
US made heavy concessions in order to convince

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.170
the North Koreans to stop their nuclear tests.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.100
So when Barack Obama came into office he wanted
to turn around that policy.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.510
His approach was quickly dubbed Strategic
Patience.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.970
In the hope of reducing tension, the administration
waited out North Korea.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.870
Neither threatening as aggressively as Bush
did, nor engaging in talks and negotiations.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:53.130
"The fact that before I came into office you
had a pattern in which North Korea would engage

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.600
in some provocative action.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.890
Countries would then try to placate them by
giving humanitarian aid or providing other

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.330
concessions or engaging in dialog."

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.670
However Obamas approach didn’t stop the
North Koreans from further improving their

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.670
missiles.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.780
And when Donald Trump came into office, the
US foreign approach in dealing with North

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.310
Korea was once again turned around completely.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:26.220
"I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations
that got us into this very dangerous position."

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.620
Trump wants to completely isolate North Korea
and he is engaging in a sort of war or words,

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.150
tweeting out threats to Kim Jong Un.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.490
Because of its smallness and economic weakness
- North Korea sees its nuclear program as

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.430
the only way to secure lasting independence.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.210
The regime knows that despite their troop
strength it’s militarily is inferior to

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.430
that of it’s neighbors

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.870
Dr. Victor Cha, who wa the Head of the american
delegation at the Six Party Talks, said that

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.520
the North Koreans themself explained this
to him during the negotiations.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.960
"And he said this without even blinking he
said: You attacked Iraq because they didn't

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.460
have nuclear weapons.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.780
You attacked Afghanistan because they didn't
have nuclear weapons.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.370
You will never attack Iran.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.010
And you will never attack us."

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.020
Now North Korean testing is more than just
a show for the outside.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.750
They have been able to steadily increase the
range of their missiles in the last few decades.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.440
It is unclear how reliable these missiles
really are.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.660
While one challenge is to increase the missiles
range and accuracy in hitting targets - they

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.670
also have to be able to withstand re-entry
into the atmosphere.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.370
And they have to carry the weight and size
of a nuclear warhead.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.450
So there are a lot of unclear variables that
make it hard to form an accurate judgement

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.810
on what North Korea is currently capable of
doing.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:55.380
Yet, North Korea is already trying to change
the situation with what we know they can do.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:03.740
"They want to decouple the Security of South
Korea from the United States and Japan.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.440
By being able to reach the continent of the
United States the North Koreans want to instill

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.070
doubt in the minds of South Koreans, Americans
and Japanese that the United States and Japan

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:25.470
are not willing to risk Tokyo or Los Angeles
or Chicago in order to defend Seoul."

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.550
Interestingly though, while North Korea's
relationship with the United States is even

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.520
more tense than before, North Korea and South
Korea have recently come closer again.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.890
At the Olympic Winter Games in South Korea,
the two countries walked in together at the

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:45.330
opening ceremony and have put together one
combined Korean ice hockey team.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.140
And along the games, South Korean President
Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un's sister met for

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.930
a diplomatic meeting.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.990
There she invited the President to a meeting
with Kim Jong Un in North Koreas capital Pyongyang.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.740
We will have to see whether a future dialogue
will this time bring real disarmament and

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:09.050
demilitarization, or whether the talks will
not lead to results like in the previous attempts.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.530
It is clear though that we are in a deciding
decade for North Korea and that the coming

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.720
developments will have a big impact on the
peninsula - one way, or the other.
