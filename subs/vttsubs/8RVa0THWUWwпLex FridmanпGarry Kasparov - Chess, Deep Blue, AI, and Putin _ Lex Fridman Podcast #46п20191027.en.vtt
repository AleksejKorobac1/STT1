so<00:13:00.680><c> that's</c><00:13:00.860><c> why</c><00:13:01.010><c> by</c><00:13:01.160><c> it</c><00:13:01.340><c> happens</c><00:13:01.940><c> very</c><00:13:02.000><c> often</c>

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:02.270 align:start position:0%
so that's why by it happens very often
 

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why by it happens very often

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:03.890 align:start position:0%
it's when you know some ideas could be
 

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.950 align:start position:0%
it's when you know some ideas could be

should<00:18:00.340><c> also</c><00:18:00.549><c> add</c><00:18:00.820><c> a</c><00:18:00.850><c> time</c><00:18:01.179><c> factor</c><00:18:01.360><c> yeah</c><00:18:01.900><c> I</c><00:18:02.020><c> was</c>

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:02.380 align:start position:0%
should also add a time factor yeah I was
 

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.610 align:start position:0%
should also add a time factor yeah I was
on<00:18:02.559><c> top</c><00:18:02.830><c> not</c><00:18:03.520><c> as</c><00:18:03.730><c> big</c><00:18:04.000><c> as</c><00:18:04.150><c> but</c><00:18:04.720><c> but</c><00:18:04.900><c> much</c><00:18:05.110><c> longer</c>

just<00:21:09.230><c> where</c><00:21:09.410><c> that</c><00:21:09.500><c> just</c><00:21:09.710><c> you</c><00:21:09.830><c> know</c><00:21:09.890><c> I</c><00:21:09.980><c> because</c>

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
just where that just you know I because
 

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
just where that just you know I because
I<00:21:10.730><c> I</c><00:21:10.910><c> was</c><00:21:11.180><c> asked</c><00:21:11.420><c> this</c><00:21:11.480><c> question</c><00:21:11.540><c> as</c><00:21:11.930><c> well</c><00:21:11.960><c> so</c><00:21:12.620><c> I</c>

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:12.890 align:start position:0%
I I was asked this question as well so I
 

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.740 align:start position:0%
I I was asked this question as well so I
say<00:21:13.280><c> that</c><00:21:13.430><c> is</c><00:21:13.550><c> this</c><00:21:13.760><c> while</c><00:21:14.030><c> it's</c><00:21:14.240><c> impossible</c>

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:14.750 align:start position:0%
say that is this while it's impossible
 

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
say that is this while it's impossible
to<00:21:14.840><c> make</c><00:21:14.960><c> a</c><00:21:14.990><c> choice</c><00:21:15.200><c> I</c><00:21:15.500><c> would</c><00:21:15.890><c> sue</c><00:21:16.130><c> probably</c><00:21:16.430><c> go</c>

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:16.490 align:start position:0%
to make a choice I would sue probably go
 

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
to make a choice I would sue probably go
with<00:21:16.610><c> Maradona</c><00:21:17.030><c> for</c><00:21:17.240><c> simple</c><00:21:17.540><c> reason</c><00:21:17.780><c> the</c>

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
with Maradona for simple reason the

with Maradona for simple reason the

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:20.510 align:start position:0%
Brazilian team in 1970 could have won
 

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
Brazilian team in 1970 could have won

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:22.970 align:start position:0%
without Collette it was absolutely great
 

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
without Collette it was absolutely great
still<00:21:23.510><c> could</c><00:21:23.660><c> have</c><00:21:23.690><c> won</c>

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.050 align:start position:0%
still could have won
 

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.130 align:start position:0%
still could have won
maybe<00:21:24.500><c> but</c><00:21:24.800><c> it</c><00:21:25.100><c> is</c><00:21:25.250><c> the</c><00:21:26.000><c> Argentinian</c><00:21:26.870><c> team</c><00:21:26.990><c> in</c>

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.140 align:start position:0%
maybe but it is the Argentinian team in
 

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.230 align:start position:0%
maybe but it is the Argentinian team in
1986<00:21:27.830><c> without</c><00:21:28.040><c> Maradona</c><00:21:28.490><c> would</c><00:21:28.850><c> not</c><00:21:29.030><c> be</c><00:21:29.150><c> in</c>

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
1986 without Maradona would not be in
 

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
1986 without Maradona would not be in
the<00:21:29.330><c> 5s</c><00:21:29.690><c> so</c><00:21:29.900><c> this</c><00:21:30.050><c> is</c><00:21:30.170><c> and</c><00:21:30.350><c> Messi</c><00:21:31.220><c> he</c><00:21:31.700><c> still</c><00:21:32.000><c> has</c>

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.310 align:start position:0%
the 5s so this is and Messi he still has
that's<00:21:33.520><c> not</c><00:21:33.700><c> good</c><00:21:34.030><c> argue</c><00:21:34.330><c> for</c><00:21:34.510><c> that</c><00:21:34.540><c> for</c><00:21:35.230><c> an</c>

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
that's not good argue for that for an

that's not good argue for that for an

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
hour but yes you could say if you ask

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:39.610 align:start position:0%
Maradona if you look in his eyes
 

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.710 align:start position:0%
Maradona if you look in his eyes
especially<00:21:40.420><c> let's</c><00:21:40.930><c> say</c><00:21:41.050><c> Gary</c><00:21:41.440><c> Kasparov</c><00:21:41.890><c> 99</c><00:21:42.820><c> he</c>

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
especially let's say Gary Kasparov 99 he
 

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.410 align:start position:0%
especially let's say Gary Kasparov 99 he
would<00:21:43.900><c> have</c><00:21:44.020><c> said</c><00:21:44.320><c> I</c><00:21:44.680><c> was</c><00:21:45.550><c> sure</c><00:21:45.850><c> as</c><00:21:46.000><c> hell</c><00:21:46.240><c> would</c>

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:46.420 align:start position:0%
would have said I was sure as hell would
 

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
would have said I was sure as hell would

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:49.270 align:start position:0%
be magnus carlsen it's just simply the
 

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
be magnus carlsen it's just simply the
confidence<00:21:49.720><c> fire</c><00:21:50.170><c> simply</c><00:21:50.950><c> because</c><00:21:51.370><c> simply</c>

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:51.970 align:start position:0%
confidence fire simply because simply
 

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
confidence fire simply because simply
because<00:21:52.420><c> again</c><00:21:52.690><c> it's</c><00:21:52.840><c> just</c><00:21:52.900><c> a</c><00:21:53.170><c> so</c><00:21:53.410><c> mean</c><00:21:53.590><c> action</c>

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.070 align:start position:0%
because again it's just a so mean action
 

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.770 align:start position:0%
because again it's just a so mean action
so<00:21:54.190><c> this</c><00:21:54.280><c> again</c><00:21:54.760><c> it's</c><00:21:54.970><c> it's</c><00:21:55.180><c> the</c><00:21:55.330><c> age</c><00:21:55.480><c> factor</c>

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:55.780 align:start position:0%
so this again it's it's the age factor
 

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.170 align:start position:0%
so this again it's it's the age factor
as<00:21:56.020><c> important</c><00:21:56.530><c> therefore</c><00:21:57.310><c> is</c><00:21:57.460><c> a</c><00:21:57.490><c> passion</c><00:21:58.000><c> and</c>

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:03.790 align:start position:0%
modern ideas but again then you make in

modern ideas but again then you make in

to<00:40:38.690><c> do</c><00:40:39.560><c> it</c><00:40:39.589><c> you</c><00:40:39.800><c> to</c><00:40:40.069><c> run</c><00:40:40.579><c> without</c><00:40:40.910><c> driver</c><00:40:41.270><c> ID</c><00:40:41.510><c> at</c>

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:41.690 align:start position:0%
to do it you to run without driver ID at
 

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:42.339 align:start position:0%
to do it you to run without driver ID at
the<00:40:41.900><c> wheel</c>

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:42.349 align:start position:0%
the wheel
 

00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
the wheel
so<00:40:42.829><c> you</c><00:40:43.160><c> know</c><00:40:43.280><c> let's</c><00:40:43.640><c> think</c><00:40:43.700><c> of</c><00:40:43.940><c> that</c><00:40:44.119><c> for</c><00:40:44.420><c> a</c>

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
so you know let's think of that for a
 

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.290 align:start position:0%
so you know let's think of that for a

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:47.300 align:start position:0%
second that double standard the way you
 

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.859 align:start position:0%
second that double standard the way you

00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:50.869 align:start position:0%
felt with your first loss against D blue
 

00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
felt with your first loss against D blue
were<00:40:51.800><c> you</c><00:40:51.950><c> treating</c><00:40:52.520><c> the</c><00:40:52.700><c> Machine</c>

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:53.470 align:start position:0%
were you treating the Machine
 

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.770 align:start position:0%
were you treating the Machine

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:58.220 align:start position:0%
or so what do you think about that
 

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.530 align:start position:0%
or so what do you think about that

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:04.430 align:start position:0%
machines and humans no it's a match and
 

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.890 align:start position:0%
machines and humans no it's a match and
that's<00:41:04.550><c> why</c><00:41:04.670><c> I</c><00:41:04.730><c> was</c><00:41:04.819><c> angry</c><00:41:05.240><c> because</c><00:41:05.329><c> I</c><00:41:05.510><c> believe</c>

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:05.900 align:start position:0%
that's why I was angry because I believe
 

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.690 align:start position:0%
that's why I was angry because I believe
they're<00:41:06.109><c> lost</c><00:41:06.290><c> the</c><00:41:06.650><c> match</c><00:41:06.859><c> was</c><00:41:07.099><c> not</c><00:41:07.130><c> you</c><00:41:07.579><c> know</c>

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:07.700 align:start position:0%
they're lost the match was not you know
 

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.870 align:start position:0%
they're lost the match was not you know
fairly<00:41:08.180><c> organized</c><00:41:08.720><c> so</c><00:41:09.050><c> the</c><00:41:09.260><c> states</c>

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.859 align:start position:0%

definitely<00:41:10.880><c> they</c><00:41:10.970><c> were</c><00:41:11.089><c> unfair</c><00:41:11.390><c> advantages</c>

00:41:11.859 --> 00:41:11.869 align:start position:0%
definitely they were unfair advantages
 

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.900 align:start position:0%
definitely they were unfair advantages
for<00:41:12.109><c> for</c><00:41:12.410><c> IBM</c><00:41:12.950><c> and</c><00:41:13.160><c> I</c><00:41:13.220><c> want</c><00:41:13.430><c> to</c><00:41:13.550><c> play</c><00:41:13.700><c> there</c>

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:13.910 align:start position:0%
for for IBM and I want to play there
 

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
for for IBM and I want to play there
another<00:41:14.599><c> match</c><00:41:15.250><c> like</c><00:41:16.250><c> rubble</c><00:41:16.670><c> mess</c>

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:16.970 align:start position:0%
another match like rubble mess
 

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.870 align:start position:0%

so<00:41:17.089><c> you're</c><00:41:17.329><c> angered</c><00:41:18.290><c> or</c><00:41:18.589><c> displeasure</c><00:41:19.460><c> was</c><00:41:19.730><c> a</c>

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
so you're angered or displeasure was a
 

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.180 align:start position:0%
so you're angered or displeasure was a

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.190 align:start position:0%
more like at the humans behind IBM
 

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.069 align:start position:0%

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
that time so that's that
 

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.099 align:start position:0%
that time so that's that
we<00:41:31.460><c> added</c><00:41:31.670><c> to</c><00:41:32.000><c> my</c><00:41:32.089><c> anger</c><00:41:32.510><c> because</c><00:41:32.779><c> I</c><00:41:32.900><c> knew</c><00:41:33.079><c> I</c>

00:41:33.099 --> 00:41:33.109 align:start position:0%
we added to my anger because I knew I
 

00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:35.140 align:start position:0%
we added to my anger because I knew I
could<00:41:33.410><c> beat</c><00:41:33.559><c> machine</c><00:41:33.859><c> yeah</c><00:41:34.250><c> yeah</c><00:41:34.640><c> so</c><00:41:34.789><c> this</c><00:41:34.910><c> and</c>

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.150 align:start position:0%
could beat machine yeah yeah so this and
 

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
could beat machine yeah yeah so this and
that's<00:41:35.420><c> the</c><00:41:35.569><c> and</c><00:41:35.779><c> I</c><00:41:35.869><c> lost</c><00:41:36.260><c> and</c><00:41:36.619><c> I</c><00:41:36.859><c> knew</c><00:41:36.980><c> I</c><00:41:37.010><c> was</c>
