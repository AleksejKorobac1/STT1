00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.840
videos like this one on Nebula for just $15
bucks a year.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.360
2017 was an especially turbulent year for
North Korea, even by its already aggressive

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.720
standards.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.810
In February, Kim Jong-Un’s older half-brother
Kim Jong-Nam was assassinated in Malaysia.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.860
During the summer, it accomplished its long-awaited
nuclear goal of firing an intercontinental

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.040
ballistic missile capable of reaching the
U.S. mainland.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.080
With this new firepower, it threatened to
attack the American territory Guam, which

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.210
the U.S. countered with its own threat of
war.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.270
The U.N. Security Council passed more severe
sanctions, and the U.S. re-added North Korea

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:59.100
to its State Sponsors of Terrorism list, joining
Iran, Sudan, and Syria, nine years after being

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.120
removed.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.709
Then, in early 2018, tensions began de-escalating.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:10.530
The world sighed a deep breath of relief as
North Korea agreed to send athletes to the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.950
South Korean Winter Olympic games, one of
a series of actions intended to signal its

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.350
goodwill.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.459
And although this cycle of rising tensions
followed by diplomatic charm was both familiar

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:28.369
and expected, there was real hope that, this
time, because North Korea had finally achieved

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.020
its nuclear security guarantee, it would genuinely
be motivated to make and stick to a deal.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.799
Kim Jong-Un personally invited Donald Trump
to a meeting, then-director of the CIA Mike

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.249
Pompeo secretly flew to Pyongyang for preliminary
arrangements, and after several near-cancellations,

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.049
both sides agreed to a summit.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.599
This would be the first-ever meeting between
a sitting American and North Korean leader.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.909
The decision to meet, however, was only the
first in a long chain of private negotiations

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.539
which would take place in the weeks leading
up to the event and would significantly impact

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.209
its outcome.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.860
One such important detail was the location
of this historic meeting, which, in many ways,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.689
would set the tone of everything to come.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.400
Initially, five places were rumored to be
in consideration.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.269
U.S. officials mentioned Vietnam, Thailand,
Switzerland, Sweden, and Singapore, specifically.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.489
At first glance, all of these choices seem
like strong candidates, and the case could

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.819
easily be made for each of them.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.849
Sweden, for example, was the first Western
nation to establish an embassy in Pyongyang,

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.409
who it has maintained unusually strong diplomatic
ties with.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.500
The U.S., which does not have an embassy in
North Korea, frequently works with and through

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.540
the Swedish embassy acting as an intermediary.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.780
Switzerland, where Kim Jong-Un received his
childhood education, was also a prime contender.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.819
Europe, however, had a natural disadvantage
in that it’s simply too far.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.989
Between taking office and that point in time,
Kim had visited only two countries - China

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:16.609
and South Korea, on three trips, during which
he was, at most, only 700 kilometers or 400

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.440
miles from his home country.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.620
Another option, Mongolia, was within reach
of Kim Jong-Un’s state plane or armored

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.530
train, but lacked the infrastructure necessary
to confidently guarantee a smooth-running

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.030
event.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.609
Most importantly, though, the choice of location
could not be seen as a concession by either

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.609
side.

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.530
Indeed, even holding the event would already
be perceived by some as legitimizing the rule

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.150
of Kim Jong-Un.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.290
Therefore, the U.S. side would likely not
agree to Pyongyang, Beijing, or Russia.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.870
The search was narrowed between either near
the Joint Security Area on the Demilitarized

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.359
Zone or Singapore - the latter of which ticked
all the boxes and then some, and was finally

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.749
agreed upon.

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:07.590
Strangely, the small island city-state is
considered ‘friendly territory’ by both

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.219
sides, and would even be approved of by other
interested parties like China, Russia, and

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:13.749
Japan.

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:20.400
This, on its own, is remarkable - that a nearby
Asian country would have no direct stake or

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.740
interest in the dispute, beyond a peaceful
resolution.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.410
Even more so that a country in the region
would have strong diplomatic relations with

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.949
both North Korea and the United States simultaneously.

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.420
Singapore hosts a North Korean embassy, traded
a small number of goods with Pyongyang before

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.770
sanctions were tightened, and, amazingly,
allowed North Korean passport holders visa-free

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.740
entry until 2016.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.340
Practically speaking, it could also guarantee
a summit without interruptions.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.090
Protests are allowed without police permission
only in a single area of one public park,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.630
called the Speaker’s Corner.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.360
A Kim Jong-Un impersonator, in fact, was detained
and questioned after arriving from Australia.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.811
These same legal features which lead some
visitors to call Singapore ‘boring’ were

00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:14.210
precisely what made it so attractive, despite
being relatively far, for Kim, and the event

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.930
going incredibly smoothly.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.430
On June 10th at 8:20 pm, Air Force One landed
at the jointly operated U.S. and Singapore

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.300
Air Force Paya Lebar Air Base.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.770
Kim, on the other hand, arrived earlier that
afternoon at Singapore’s main international

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.169
airport, before touring the downtown area
in the evening - a sign of just how safe the

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.240
young dictator felt.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.930
The Singaporean government, meanwhile, was
not merely an observer.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.229
It held high-level meetings with both presidents,
paid for the North Korean accommodation, and

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:55.400
released an official logo for the event - promoting
its reputation as a trusted, neutral third-party

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.199
facilitator.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.639
This image has been carefully crafted over
decades.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.710
It also hosts the annual Shangri-La Dialogue
and rotating summits of the Association of

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.720
Southeast Asian Nations.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.680
In 2015, Singapore was chosen for the no-less-historic
or delicate meeting between chairman Xi Jinping

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.320
of the People’s Republic of China and then-president
of the Republic of China, or Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.389
That event was so sensitive in nature that
even the linguistic terms used were carefully

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.009
scrutinized.

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.229
Because neither side recognizes the legitimacy
of the other, officials negotiated their respective

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.680
titles in advance.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.949
They would be addressed as the ‘Leader of
Mainland China’ and ‘Leader of Taiwan’,

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.030
and refer to each other only as ‘mister’
in Mandarin.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.360
Here, too, Singapore is unusual in that it
carefully engages both sides of this heated

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.530
geopolitical divide.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:58.000
Its military has trained with Taiwan since
the 70s and is the only Southeast Asian country

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.600
to share with it a bilateral free-trade agreement.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.289
Singapore’s long-standing, almost default
status as a trusted intermediary makes it

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:12.090
easy to forget just how unlikely this fact
is.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.539
Having been forced into independence by its
expulsion from the Federation of Malaysia

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:23.199
in 1965, the new republic faced several potentially
existential threats.

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:30.150
At about 700 square kilometers or 270 square
miles, Singapore is about 1/4th the size of

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.360
Rhode Island, has no large lakes or rivers,
is devoid of natural resources, and is now

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.639
home to around 5 and a half million people.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:44.599
Not only is it not predisposed to project
global power and relevance, but its small

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:51.289
size and close proximity to much larger Malaysia
and Indonesia make even its continued existence

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:52.289
challenging.

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:57.770
And because of its strategic location on the
Strait of Malacca, it even faces threats from

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.330
non-state actors like pirates.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.280
These undesirable circumstances impressed
on its early government the urgent necessity

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.389
of making and keeping as many friends as possible.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:15.689
From those early days of independence, Singapore
positioned itself as the Switzerland of Asia

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:19.139
- engaging with anyone who would accept its
friendship.

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:24.729
But while Swiss neutrality is deliberately
static and unchanging, Singapore attempts

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:31.009
to balance the relative influence of its powerful
allies - China and the United States.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:35.970
In addition to being its largest source of
foreign investment, the U.S. is also a significant

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.820
military partner.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.430
When the American military was ordered to
leave the Philippines in the 90s, Singapore

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:47.960
allowed it access to its Changi Naval Base
- one of only a few piers in Asia deep enough

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.610
for U.S. aircraft carriers to dock and resupply.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.750
American nuclear submarines, aircraft carrier
groups, and spy planes regularly transit through

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.000
Singapore on their way to conduct ‘freedom
of navigation’ exercises in the South China

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Sea.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.030
This military cooperation agreement was renewed
for the second time in 2020, and, in another

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:16.820
sign of its strong ties, the U.S. also sold
Singapore twelve F-35 fighter jets.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:23.380
But while it engages with the U.S. very closely,
it does not do so exclusively.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.360
Singapore is careful never to choose sides.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:32.170
For example, it never officially refers to
the U.S. as an ‘ally’, and uses the term

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.370
‘American facilities’, not ‘bases’.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:40.820
Likewise, it abstains from discussing sensitive
issues in China, including its controversial

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.530
maritime claims.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.340
Singapore conducts military training exercises
with the People’s Liberation Army, and China

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.890
is its largest trading partner.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:55.680
Realistically, neither China nor the U.S.
likely appreciate its close relations with

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.290
the other, and occasionally attempt to tilt
the balance in their favor.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.730
When Singapore is tested, however, it almost
always remains disciplined in its neutrality.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.710
For example, in 2003, it turned down an offer
to become an official non-NATO ally to the

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.710
U.S.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:19.720
And in 2016, China impounded nine of its armored
military vehicles in Hong Kong on their return

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.940
journey from training in Taiwan - a clear
reminder of its influence.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.610
For the most part, both sides appreciate the
predictability of this strategy, which has

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:35.190
survived three Singaporean Prime Ministers
and ten American Presidents - six of which

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.450
were Republican, and four Democratic.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.020
For decades, Singapore has greatly benefitted
from the economic rise of China, while not

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:49.270
being beholden to it, thanks to its close
military engagement with the U.S.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.870
In not being forced to choose sides, it’s
benefited from both.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:00.090
But as China has grown in size and influence,
deteriorating its relations with the U.S.,

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.200
Singapore has remained small.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.610
The close personal relationship of its founder,
Lee Kuan Yew, with China’s leadership is

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.670
no more, and, once again, it must fight to
survive.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.280
As the peaceful stability which enabled its
prosperity is replaced with more aggressive

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:23.480
relations between its two non- ‘ally’
allies, the cost of neutrality will only grow.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.410
In other words, one day Singapore may finally
be forced to choose a side.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.810
But until that day comes, it would like for
both sides to fear the outcome.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:39.200
Singapore’s natural dependence on other
countries has led it to pursue some unusual

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.990
policies to ensure its security.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:47.850
For example, the Singaporean government has
convinced its population to drink pee.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.020
Humorous as that sounds, it’s absolutely
not a joke.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.210
To find out what drinking pee has to do with
Singapore’s national security, you can watch

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:03.510
the extended version of this video which replaces
this ad, on our new streaming platform, Nebula.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:08.690
While these videos will continue being available
here, there are some topics and tangents,

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.970
like drinking pee that aren’t quite right
for YouTube but I just can’t not mention.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:19.270
If you enjoy these videos, the best way to
watch them is before they’re posted on YouTube,

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:24.740
without ads, and with specially-made bonus
content from your favorite creators like Wendover

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.480
Productions, Real Engineering, and RealLifeLore
on Nebula.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.710
But it gets better because we’ve partnered
with CuriosityStream, where you can watch

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.840
documentaries like Singapore's Field of Dreams,
which explains how the city built a stadium

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.030
which can adapt to hold over 30 different
sports, and The Rise Of The Gulf, about the

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.870
growth of oil cities like Dubai.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:52.410
