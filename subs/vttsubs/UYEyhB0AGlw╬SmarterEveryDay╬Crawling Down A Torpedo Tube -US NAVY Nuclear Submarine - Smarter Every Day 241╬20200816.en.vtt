00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:00.990
 Hey, it's me, Destin.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.407
Welcome back to
Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:04.380
We're right in the
middle of a deep dive

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.020
here on Smarter Every Day
into nuclear submarines.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.360
We're investigating all
these different things

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.610
about how nuclear
submarines work,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.430
and we're trying to learn
very detailed information

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.740
about each individual thing.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.490
Today we're going to
talk about torpedoes,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.860
which is fascinating to
me because I've actually

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.730
been down range from a torpedo
when it's engaged a target.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.700
This is me in a
helicopter back in 2018

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.180
as the part of my job, which was
a developmental weapons tester.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.080
I'm filming the USS Racine
waiting on a Mark 48 torpedo

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.250
to impact.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.440
And when it did,
it was devastating.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.200
That was a part of RIMPAC, the
Rim of the Pacific exercise.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.680
That activity took place at
what's called the Barking Sands

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.940
Missile Range Facility.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.100
And what's so interesting
about that is they

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.890
test missiles there, but
they also test torpedoes.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.350
If you looked off the coast
of Kauai at any given day,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.050
you could see a helicopter
towing a torpedo

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.933
that it had picked up out in
the ocean after being fired

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.850
and they did some kind
of weapons development.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.683
But here's the deal.

00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:04.260
Even though torpedoes are super
fascinating and they're modern

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.180
and they're constantly
being changed,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.470
they are very old technology.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.400
In fact, they were used to
great effect during World War I.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.730
So this technology needed to
fire a torpedo from a submarine

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.150
is very old, but generally
speaking most people don't

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.260
know how it works.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.090
Today we're literally
going to crawl

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.020
inside the torpedo tube of a US
nuclear submarine in the Arctic

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.880
Ocean under the
ice, and we're going

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.740
to be able to look
around inside this tube

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.080
and try to understand how
all these things work.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.680
All right.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.328
Let's do it.

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:34.620
Let's go get Smarter Every Day.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.580
[THEME MUSIC]

00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:44.730
 That's running down
towards the torpedo room.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.605
DESTIN: Torpedo room.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.855
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:47.410
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.710
MAN: It's a thing.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.810
DESTIN: This is the party.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.490
 And so one of the places
you could have flooding,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.940
this is one of the
very few, right.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.482
But that's the most
important spaces.

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:55.860
DESTIN: Oh, well,
I'll be danged.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.360
There we go.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.260
 And there it is.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.080
DESTIN: And there it is.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.820
OK.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.320
 All right.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.040
So what we got here is--

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.873
 Going to touch it.

00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:03.220
 So my name's Alan Howell.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.270
I'm the Torpedo Division
Chief Petty Officer here

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.267
on the USS Toledo.

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:07.100
DESTIN: Oh, awesome.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.880
Rock and roll.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.620
So you're over the torpedoes,
did I understand correctly?

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.120
 Yes, sir.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.890
That is correct.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.390
DESTIN: OK.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.170
So right now where
are the torpedo tubes?

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.720
 So torpedo are forward the
ship on the port and starboard

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.220
side.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.030
So we currently have
four torpedo tubes

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.383
on the 688 class submarine.

00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:23.800
Two over here on the starboard
side, two over on the port.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.000
 So that's what I'm
seeing right there?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.670
 Yes, sir.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.070
DESTIN: OK, and then--

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.410
 What you're seeing
is the breach doors.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.575
DESTIN: And there's
one way over there.

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:29.630
ALAN HOWELL: And there's
two more over on that side.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.100
DESTIN: Two on that side.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.200
 Yes, sir.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.400
DESTIN: OK.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.950
Got it.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.400
 So what you're seeing
is the breach doors.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.530
And when we're done
with this evolution

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.180
we can open them up
for you, and if you

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.670
want to crawl down in there
you're more than welcome to.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.400
DESTIN: In the torpedo tube?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.880
 Absolutely.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.630
DESTIN: Crap yeah, I do.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.080
 Yeah.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.170
Good.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.650
DESTIN: Let's do that.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.150
 We send our torpedo
men down there

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.100
once a month for maintenance, so
we dive the tubes every month.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.020
So we're in there all the time.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.320
DESTIN: I like you already.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.945
 So you're in.

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:46.862
DESTIN: Rock and roll.

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:48.710
I'm going to set this
camera up over here.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.355
So, well, now I guess it's going
to open that way, isn't it?

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:52.490
Can I prop it on this?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.240
ALAN HOWELL: Sure.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.250
We got a green if you
want to put that on.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.260
It's probably going
to be wet down there.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.730
 So this is--

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.918
 TM2 Knight.

00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:00.710
DESTIN: TM2 Knight.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.760
What does TM2 mean?

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.670
 That means torpedoman's mate.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.970
DESTIN: Torpedoman's mate.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.490
 Yes, sir.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.157
DESTIN: OK cool.

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.750
And my understanding is
this is a torpedo tube.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.290
 Yes, sir.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.120
DESTIN: And there's a thing
that you're going to let me do.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.930
 Yes, sir.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.020
So we're going to open
up the breach door

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.170
and let you crawl down inside
and sign your name at the--

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.140
or at least try to sign your
name on the muzzle door.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.420
DESTIN: This is the standard
door for a torpedo tube,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.960
I guess.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.510
TM2 KNIGHT: Yes, sir.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.330
DESTIN: And it's hydraulically
operated, you said?

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.680
TM2 KNIGHT: Yes, sir.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.110
DESTIN: OK.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.340
And this is a torpedo, right?

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:29.540
TM2 KNIGHT: Yes, sir.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.017
Mark 48 ADCAP.

00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:32.100
DESTIN: What's ADCAP mean?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.683
TM2 KNIGHT: Means
advanced capability.

00:03:33.683 --> 00:03:35.960
DESTIN: And so this yellow
stripe right here means

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.970
that is a live torpedo?

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.187
TM2 KNIGHT: Yes, sir.

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:40.145
DESTIN: That's amazing.

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:41.812
If you think about
what's going on here,

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:44.690
you've got this long torpedo
down in the bottom floor

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.735
of this submarine.

00:03:45.735 --> 00:03:46.610
How did it get there?

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.980
Because we barely have
enough room to move around.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.600
OK, so this is Jacob, the
assistant weapons officer.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.253
 I'm also the diving officer,
so I'm responsible for--

00:03:54.253 --> 00:03:55.670
biggest responsibility
is probably

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.660
rig for dive, which
we'll talk about here.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.340
But this is the
command passageway.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.000
Naval tradition kind of thing.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.300
It's a area where you're
supposed to minimize passage.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.740
Only certain people are allowed
regular passage through here.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.790
Right here is the
weapon shipping hatch.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.370
And it happens to be
the most convenient way

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.230
to get into the ship, but it's
also the primary means by which

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.665
we load torpedoes, actually.

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:20.290
DESTIN: Really?

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.070
JACOB: Right now
it's rigged for dive,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.500
so I can't just open this
without cabin suppression.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.750
But if you were to open this,
it swings down that way.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.140
You can see that hand wheel
or that lever right there.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.980
DESTIN: Right.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.560
JACOB: Turn it and it
will swing down that way.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.710
You'll see that it's
actually got a cant,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.120
and that's so that torpedoes
actually come in like this,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.900
and you wonder where
they're going to go.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.390
Well, these plates right
here, these deck plates,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.660
you take them out and there's
a tray underneath that

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.040
actually swings downward.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.330
Its hinges are on this side.

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:51.264
DESTIN: Coming through, captain?

00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:52.200
 No, I'm good.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.630
 And likewise on
the next deck down,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.190
take the deck plates out,
shipping tray hinges downward,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.940
goes all the way down
to the torpedo room.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.290
And when we load
torpedoes that way.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.957
 What I think is
fascinating about this

00:05:01.957 --> 00:05:04.610
is the geometry of
taking this huge torpedo

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.320
and getting it to
the bottom floor.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.840
All this was figured
out way back in the day.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.120
Like the first Los
Angeles class submarines

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.680
were laid down in
the '70s, which

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.770
means all the decisions those
engineers made back then

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.890
affect what types of
weapons can be fired now.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.650
Now, I couldn't find any
footage of loading torpedoes

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.300
into a Los Angeles
class submarine.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.170
However, I did find footage of
a harpoon missile being loaded.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.450
Now, that has the
same geometric form

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.730
factor as a Mark 48 torpedo.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.520
But what's interesting is if
you watch how they do this,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.490
it's like a choreographed
dance to get this torpedo down

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.730
to the bottom floor.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.120
So it doesn't matter what
technological advancements you

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.620
make in the weaponry
itself, for the seeker heads

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.120
or the guidance or
the fire control.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.870
It doesn't matter.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.410
You are still constrained
by the physical size

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.980
of the torpedo tube and how you
can physically lower it down

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.420
to the bottom deck of the boat.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.820
When it comes to actually
inserting the torpedo

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.430
into the tube, there's either
one of two ways that it's done.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.930
Number one, you
could use hydraulics

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.960
which basically pushes the
round all the way into the tube.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.720
Or number two, they can
actually override that and do it

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.693
with snatch blocks
and muscle power,

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:09.110
because snatch
blocks are awesome.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.580
What do you call this
contraption here?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.980
This is the door of the torpedo?

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.260
TM2 KNIGHT: That's the
breach ring or breach

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.680
door for the torpedo tube.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.235
DESTIN: OK.

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:17.610
And so if I
understand correctly,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.320
you're going to open that.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.730
And what you would normally
do is you would go inside

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.050
and you would clean it?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.030
Is that right?

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.730
 Yes, sir.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.000
DESTIN: OK.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.980
And you're going to let me try?

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.590
 Yes, sir.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.550
 So how do you open this?

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.050
 All right.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.433
So first we're going to verify
that everybody's clear of it

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.600
and there's nothing interfering
with it because it's

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.097
hydraulics.

00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:38.092
We're going to go on one.

00:06:38.092 --> 00:06:38.592
Clear.

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:43.083
All right.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:44.081
We're good.

00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:45.578
Just pull this plug.

00:06:50.068 --> 00:06:50.568
DESTIN: Wow.

00:06:50.568 --> 00:06:54.061
 Make sure it's latched.

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:55.740
And there's the torpedo tube.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.357
DESTIN: Oh, it's awesome.

00:06:57.357 --> 00:06:58.690
OK, I'm going to level with you.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.190
This was the moment
in my life where

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.070
I realized I was
being offered a chance

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.890
to crawl inside a torpedo
tube in a nuclear submarine.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.500
So side note, how the
heck did that happen?

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.660
But when it comes right
down to the reality

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.540
of what's about to go down,
how does a torpedo fire?

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.620
I did not know how a torpedo
leaves the tube of a submarine.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.280
No clue.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.870
Before we crawl
down in the tube,

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.890
I want to try to explain
how this thing works

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.140
so you'll have a better idea
of what we're looking at.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.970
This is a model of
a Mark 48 torpedo.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.970
Just 3D printed this,
painted it, the whole bit.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.750
I'm really proud of it.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.500
Anyway, there's something
really cool about this

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.250
I want you to see.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.890
If you look really close
here, on the top of this thing

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.850
you can see there's this little
tab kind of thing, right?

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.840
So those little tabs right there
have a very specific purpose.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.070
If we open the back
of the torpedo tube,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.700
you can see that on top
there's this little Y,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.010
and that Y guides that
little tab into the tube

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.020
so the torpedo will always align
to the correct orientation.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.220
Up will always be up.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.510
But there's other things
you can do, right?

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.310
Not only does it give
you radial alignment,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.400
but it can give you axial
alignment along the longitude

00:07:59.400 --> 00:07:59.910
of the tube.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.930
I don't know if I'm saying that
right, but I think you get it.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.530
So as it goes in, if you have
something that's pushing down

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.190
inside that little Y slot, as
the torpedo goes forward, boop,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.980
it'll bump right there
and it'll stop the torpedo

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.433
from going any farther.

00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:14.100
If you have something
on the back of it,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.670
that'll keep it from
going backwards.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.960
So at that point, you have
constrained the torpedo

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.520
in six degrees of freedom.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.750
Roll pitch, yaw, X, Y, Z. Just
with that little slot and two

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.063
little lugs on each side.

00:08:26.063 --> 00:08:27.480
Before we go down
the tube, I want

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.910
you to understand exactly
how the torpedo launching

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.007
system works.

00:08:31.007 --> 00:08:32.549
So the first thing
we do is make sure

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.828
the locking lugs are in
the correct configuration,

00:08:34.828 --> 00:08:36.870
and that's that little
tab thing I was explaining

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.287
would keep the torpedo from
sliding forward and backwards.

00:08:39.287 --> 00:08:41.059
So the forward
locking lug is going

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.900
to be in the load
position, which

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.990
means it's going to be down, but
the back one is going to be up.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.760
Next, we open the
breach door and we

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.290
can slide the torpedo in.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.320
Again, we can do that with
hydraulics or, my favorite way,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.340
snatch blocks.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.490
Once the torpedo is in and the
locking bolt on the torpedo

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.130
has moved up against the
locking lug in the tube,

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.710
the aft locking lug
comes down and secures

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.030
the torpedo in the tube.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.460
In case the submarine
pitches up for some reason

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.620
you don't want it to slide
against the breach door.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.840
At this point the breach
door is shut and locked,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.750
and now the torpedo is stable
inside the torpedo tube

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.010
and ready for use.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.320
In the event they actually
want to fire the torpedo,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.370
the following
sequence takes place.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.550
First of all, you have
to flood the tube.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.100
There's a tank full of
water called the WRT,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.220
or Water Round Torpedo tank.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.990
A valve is open to allow
water to flood the tank,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.630
but because there's air in there
that you have to let escape

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.210
you also have to open a valve up
top that will vent the air out

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.980
as you fill it up with water.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.310
So this venting of the air
back into the submarine

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.100
is critical because air
is a precious resource.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.910
You're a submarine.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.260
You're a set volume.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.008
Now, it's cool to
move air around

00:09:45.008 --> 00:09:46.800
in different compartments
in the submarine,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.110
but you never let it
go because you only

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.300
have the air that you
brought with you, especially

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.590
when you're under the ice.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.715
And you don't want to have
to come back to the top,

00:09:54.715 --> 00:09:57.450
or in this case you can't go
back to the top, and get more.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.960
So it's important to
preserve your air.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.280
OK, so the water
from the WRT tank

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.380
is filling up the
torpedo tube itself.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.990
And at some point it
completely fills the tube

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.180
and starts to go up
into the vent line.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.920
Up there there's
an electrode that

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.800
senses the seawater, and
at that point the valve

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.170
on top and the valve on the
bottom close at the same time

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.830
and we have a torpedo tube
completely filled with water.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.260
When you go to fill up the
torpedo tube with water

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.960
you can't take water
from off the boat,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.240
because if you have
hundreds of gallons of water

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.310
that you need to fill
that tank suddenly

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.250
that's like putting thousands
of pounds on the front right

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.580
corner of your boat which would
cause you to tip like this.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.400
So in order to do this they had
this carefully choreographed

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.580
buoyancy ballet where they
take water that's already

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.160
on the ship-- in fact,
it's very near the tube--

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.730
and they fill the
tube with that.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.810
So there's no mass exchange
between off the boat

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.010
and inside.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.190
That way they can carefully trim
everything out and it will stay

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.010
trimmed throughout the
entire firing sequence.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.780
So at this point we
have a torpedo tube

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.520
that's filled with
water, but the problem

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.250
is it is at a lower pressure
than outside the boat.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.230
Because as you know,
the deeper a submarine

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.990
goes the higher and higher
the pressures can get.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.910
So what we have
to do is equalize

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.310
the system, and that's the
purpose of this valve right

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.840
here, the equalizing valve.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.940
Once we turn this thing,
the pressure in the tube

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.813
will now be the same as the
pressure out in the ocean.

00:11:17.813 --> 00:11:19.230
Now that we have
the same pressure

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.712
on the inside of
the tube as we do

00:11:20.712 --> 00:11:22.170
on the outside of
the submarine, we

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.080
can open the muzzle door because
the forces are equalized.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.170
But it's also time to move
what's called the slide valve.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.270
The slide valve
is a movable part

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.150
of the tube that's about
midway down the torpedo

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.510
that concentrically covers all
these different rectangular

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.340
ports through which
water can travel.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.610
So the slide valve
moves, exposing

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.640
those rectangular ports,
and now you can dump water

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.230
into the torpedo tube.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.810
At this point we are
completely ready to fire.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.940
And when the fire command
comes from fire control

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.910
back in the control room,
both the locking lugs retract,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.300
which frees up the
torpedo to move axially,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.460
and pressurized water
from an impulse tank

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.160
provides a tremendous
amount of pressure in-flow

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.380
which is then introduced
into the torpedo tube

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.110
from all those rectangular holes
which were covered by the slide

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.270
valve, and this additional
water in the tube

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.040
pushes the torpedo out the
front of the submarine.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.540
OK.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.700
What I'm about to tell you,
I do not know for a fact.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.492
But think about it.

00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:17.510
We had a huge torpedo in
the tube, and we fired it,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.850
and it is no longer
on the submarine.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.400
The weight of that
torpedo is gone,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.180
which tells me that in order to
maintain balance in the system

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.820
an ideal torpedo is
probably neutrally buoyant.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.200
Anyway, so at this point we
have to return the system

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.250
to its original state without
gaining or losing mass.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.330
How do we do that?

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.560
OK, so the first thing
we're going to do

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.210
is we're going to
close the muzzle door

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.480
and close the slide valve
and then close the equalizing

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.050
valve.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.290
At this point the tube is
now shut off from the ocean.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.147
And this is the
other magic trick.

00:12:50.147 --> 00:12:51.980
How do we get all this
water out of the tube

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.170
without changing the
weight of the boat?

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.600
We open this three-way valve
down here at the bottom,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.660
and we divert the water from
the tube to the auxiliary tank.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.270
But because it's going to
take forever for that to drain

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.400
and you have to back-fill
that water with air,

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.260
we might as well
use pressurized air.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.295
So we open this
blow valve up top,

00:13:08.295 --> 00:13:09.920
and we have a
pressurized source of air

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.460
to force all that water out
down into that aux tank.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.170
At this point, when
the tube is dry

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.290
we close both of
those valves and we

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.928
are left with a
pressurized torpedo tube.

00:13:19.928 --> 00:13:22.220
That's unacceptable because
we don't want to waste air.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.800
So what we do at this point
is we open the three-way valve

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.800
on top and we vent that
pressurized air back

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.643
into the people part
of the submarine.

00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:30.560
And there you have it.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.830
All you have to do is unlock
and open the breach and lower

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.360
the front locking
lug, and you're

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.090
ready to load another
torpedo in the tube.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.610
 That plate right
there that you can see?

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.870
That's the slide valve there.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.090
That's where once the
tube is flooded down,

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.970
if we would open
that slide valve

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.840
and there was flow slots inside.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.310
So that tank is basically
just a free flooded area, so

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.855
on the other side of
that valve is water.

00:13:54.855 --> 00:13:55.730
 Where is the valve?

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.605
TM2 KNIGHT: It's this
giant plate right here.

00:13:57.605 --> 00:14:00.110
That would slide forward
and uncover the flow slots.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.000
DESTIN: Got it.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.500
Got it.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.167
So this thing moves
forward, and there's

00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:05.710
holes around the outside
that pushes the torpedo out.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.585
TM2 KNIGHT: Yes, sir.

00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:11.210
The torpedo gets loaded
in all the way down.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.780
We flood down the tube.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.960
We equalize it with
the sea pressure.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.520
And then that slide valve,
once we open the muzzle door,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.240
will open, and that
pressure pushes

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.950
the weapon out of the tube.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:22.700
DESTIN: Got it.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.450
OK.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:24.020
Cool.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.405
So just crawl down there and
sign my name at the end, right?

00:14:27.405 --> 00:14:28.280
TM2 KNIGHT: Yes, sir.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.155
 Am I still rolling?

00:14:29.155 --> 00:14:30.160
 You're still rolling.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.875
DESTIN: So what can
I not step on here?

00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:33.500
TM2 KNIGHT: You don't
want to step on--

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.410
DESTIN: Can I step on
the nose of the torpedo?

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.320
 I would step right here--

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.612
DESTIN: [LAUGHS] OK, thank you.

00:14:37.612 --> 00:14:39.290
 There's sensitive
stuff in there.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.790
 OK.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.290
Here we go.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.450
 Put your foot on here.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.604
 Thank you.

00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:48.586
[GROANS]

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.670
Yeah, you couldn't be
claustrophobic and do this,

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.970
could you?

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:06.510
 No, sir.

00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:13.285
DESTIN: So these valves here,
are these little screens?

00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:14.910
 Those are just
strainers to make sure

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.520
that whenever we drain the
torpedo tube nothing solid

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.785
gets into the system.

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:19.410
DESTIN: Gotcha.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.050
So there's seawater on
the other side of this?

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.870
 Yes, sir.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.340
DESTIN: That's crazy.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.815
So sign my name right here?

00:15:34.815 --> 00:15:35.690
TM2 KNIGHT: Yes, sir.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.678
Anywhere you like.

00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:38.470
DESTIN: Oh, a lot of
people have done this.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.900
It's really, really cold.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.880
I guess because we're
in the arctic, huh?

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.433
 Might have something
to do with it.

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.600
DESTIN: There's no way this
marker is going to work.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.470
It's literally ice.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.040
Well, there was an attempt.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.780
 Sometimes that's
all you can ask for.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.238
DESTIN: That's all
you can ask for.

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:13.610
Let's see if I can see you.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.040
That's awesome.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.840
You're a really long ways away.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.860
 About 20 feet.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.850
DESTIN: 20 feet?

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:20.930
 Yes, sir.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.400
DESTIN: That's pretty cool.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.030
Sweet.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.990
Coming back.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.907
TM2 KNIGHT: All right.

00:16:37.191 --> 00:16:38.733
 Apparently there's
ice on the door.

00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:39.230
MAN: Ice?

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.730
 Yeah.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:40.721
[LAUGHS]

00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:42.212
MAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.080
DESTIN: So is that
a detailed slot?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.340
 Say again?

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:54.840
Oh, yeah.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:03.777
So what you're looking at
right now is the stop bolt.

00:17:03.777 --> 00:17:04.319
DESTIN: Yeah.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.111
TM2 KNIGHT: So when we
load the torpedo in,

00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:09.410
it's got a little
notch on the top of it.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:15.079
So we load that in, and that
forward one, it is down.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.934
So that stops it.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:16.476
DESTIN: Yeah.

00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:20.430
TM2 KNIGHT: And we roll it so
that the rear one comes down as

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.410
well, and that locks
the torpedo in place

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.119
so that it's not going to come
out of the tube with the breach

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.040
door open.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.790
DESTIN: Oh, I see.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.130
So it's a can that rolls.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.910
 Yes, sir.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.500
DESTIN: Did you grease it?

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.510
TM2 KNIGHT: We have greased it.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.520
DESTIN: That's awesome.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.320
It looks like it's riding
on some type of Teflon

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.460
or Delrin or something.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.090
 Yes, sir.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.060
That's the sliding surfaces
so that the torpedo

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.730
has something to slide on
without scratching or damaging

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.230
it.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.650
 That was awesome.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.590
That was really cool.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.560
It was ice.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.080
 Yeah.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.880
DESTIN: Is that normal?

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.800
That's just the arctic, I guess.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.300
 Yeah, no.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.610
Just being in the arctic
with how cold it is.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.270
DESTIN: That's amazing.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.745
Well, that's something I
never thought I would do.

00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:21.620
There was an attempt.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.100
 There was an attempt.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.600
 All right.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.220
So that sliding down a torpedo
tube on the USS Toledo.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.720
Thank you.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.483
 No problem, sir.

00:18:30.483 --> 00:18:31.400
DESTIN: Appreciate it.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.760
It was freaking
cold is what it was.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.783
like ice.

00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:36.950
MAN: Like real cold, I know.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.180
 Ice at the end, yeah.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.260
I didn't expect that.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
This video is a part of the
Smarter Every Day deep dive

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.660
series into nuclear submarines.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.000
We're going to study a whole
bunch of different stuff,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.583
and I would love it if you would
consider subscribing to learn

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:50.780
about this stuff with us.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.840
It's fascinating.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.150
There's way more to come.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.850
This episode is
sponsored by Raycon.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.340
If you've never used
Raycons, highly recommend it.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.500
These are called
the Everyday E25s.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.240
And I want to show
these things to you.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.930
Check these out.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.930
So this black pair
here was given to me

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.460
when Raycon was
like, hey, are you

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.760
interested in letting us be a
sponsor of Smarter Every Day?

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.670
Checked them out.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.860
I absolutely love them.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.510
These things are like half the
price of other premium earbud

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.758
audio brands, but they
sound just as good.

00:19:20.758 --> 00:19:21.800
They're very comfortable.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.133
When you buy these things,
they have all different kinds

00:19:24.133 --> 00:19:26.930
of the little rubber
things that go in your ear.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.660
You can get the exact size
that fits you the best.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.890
They're fantastic.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.732
You get 6 hours of
play time per charge.

00:19:33.732 --> 00:19:34.940
And you're going to dig them.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.050
I highly recommend these.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.818
I use them when I
bush hog this field.

00:19:37.818 --> 00:19:39.860
As a matter of fact, about
time to do that again.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.090
If you want to try these,
go to buyraycon.com/smarter.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.250
You get 15% off your order.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.758
I recommend the Everyday E25s.

00:19:47.758 --> 00:19:48.800
You're going to dig them.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.513
You can pick whatever
color you want.

00:19:50.513 --> 00:19:51.680
I like the blue ones myself.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.060
But you know, whatever you like.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.290
Big thanks to Raycon.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.250
I like your products.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.938
In the last episode I showed
a little orange flower

00:19:57.938 --> 00:20:00.230
and said Dad and I don't cut
it because the butterflies

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.950
like it.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.080
Turns out it's called
butterfly milkweed.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.580
People told me that
in the comments.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.362
There it is.

00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:07.070
Told you the butterflies
like this stuff.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.760
Isn't that pretty?

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.052
Thanks for making me Smarter
Every Day in the comments.

00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:10.730
I'm Destin.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.400
I hope you stay tuned for the
rest of the Smarter Every Day

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.810
deep dive into submarines.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.310
We're going to learn
a lot of stuff.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.118
How do you make
pizza on a submarine?

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:19.910
What are the bathrooms
like on a submarine?

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.320
All kinds of stuff like that.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.850
Please consider subscribing.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.260
There's a lot more to learn.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.660
I'm Destin getting
Smarter Every Day.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.710
Have a good one.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.310
Bye.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.500
