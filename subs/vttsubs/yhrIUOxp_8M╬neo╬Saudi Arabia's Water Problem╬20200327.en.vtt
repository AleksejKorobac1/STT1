00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.380
For many people (Saudi Arabia) is famous for its oil, which is a pool of fluids

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.610
 She brought with her wealth to the monarchy.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.840
 But there are valuable resources under the arid Arabian desert, called "groundwater",

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.320
 It enabled them to cultivate huge agricultural areas in the middle of the desert.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.710
 There are only 18 countries on this planet without rivers.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.269
 (Saudi Arabia) is the largest of them.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.190
 The case with many of these countries is that they are often small island states

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.810
 And it does not have high altitudes to help the formation of rivers.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.350
 In the "Gulf" region, that is a different story.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.659
 Here, the scene is marked by the "Arabian Desert".

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.560
 By definition, a river is a permanently flowing body of water.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.420
 In (Saudi Arabia), there are so-called "valleys".

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.330
 It is a dry riverbed, some of which are seasonal.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.799
 For example, "Wadi Hanifa", which runs through the capital (Riyadh).

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.110
 This map shows the elevations in Saudi Arabia.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.369
 The "Asir Mountains" extend along the coast to the "Red Sea".

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.140
 Here, the climate is cooler and during the 'Indian Ocean' monsoon season there is a great deal

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.520
 Of precipitation in this region, as is evident from this rainfall map.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.960
 Due to water scarcity, it is a major challenge for (Saudi Arabia) in maintaining agriculture and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.670
 Avoiding dependence almost entirely on imports.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.830
 In order to use more efficient rains for agriculture and water supply, several dams

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.240
 It was built, especially in the southwest of the country, as a reserve.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.170
 It is noteworthy that the "Bish Dam" and the "King Fahd Dam", which are considered among the largest reservoirs

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.080
 In the state.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.640
 In the rest of the country the rain is infrequent and uneven and thus insufficient

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.690
 To preserve livestock and cultivate productively.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.420
 In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a political desire to be self-sufficient

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.900
 And the state has pushed forward many initiatives to renew the agricultural sector.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.510
 And if you looked at the desert from space, you would now see large agricultural areas filled up

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.510
 From crop circles resulting from "pivot irrigation".

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.430
 The water needed for this is pumped from deep below the surface.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.860
 From the "aquifers" that were filled during the "Ice Age" when the climate was in this region

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.160
 Significantly cool

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.200
 With the help of this water, which has accumulated thousands of years ago, large areas can

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.840
 Used for cultivation.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.000
 But there are also a lot of difficulties.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.570
 After all, groundwater in this region is almost non-renewable, due to which it is

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.090
 There is hardly any rain.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.620
 (The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) suffers from the rapid depletion of water in the "aquifers".

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.440
 And the country's agricultural sector is disintegrating.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.530
 The level of "groundwater" in (Al-Ahsa) decreased by about 150 meters, which is equivalent to

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.650
 492 feet in just 25 years.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.960
 And the circular green fields in the desert are disappearing fast.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.730
 (Saudi Arabia) in 2008 had to adjust course.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.240
 They have given up on the idea of ​​turning their deserts into fertile farmland.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.130
 This census shows the annual wheat production in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.240
 Reforms in the 1980s led to a massive increase.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.440
 But since 2008 this number has decreased completely.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.290
 And when we put in the quantity of imported wheat, we see the change in strategy

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.449
 2008 year.

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.500
 The "agricultural investment" initiative was launched abroad.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.910
 The goal is to purchase and manage land in other countries in order to save water at home.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.280
 Saudi Food Companies acquire agricultural lands in (Argentina), and through subsidiary companies,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.479
 In Arizona and California.

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.349
 "Alfalfa" is mainly grown, then it is imported to (Saudi Arabia) and used as "cattle feed".

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.520
 With this method, they do not have to worry about depleting their aquifers

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.039
 So they are actually importing water.

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.819
 They also lease land in (Sudan), as well as (Zambia) and to a large extent in (Ethiopia).

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.940
 There is already a lease agreement belonging to (Saudi Star for Agricultural Development) for an area of ​​140 thousand hectares in

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.110
 (Ethiopia)

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.850
 The Saudi company’s long-term goal is to lease up to 500,000 hectares.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.080
 These investments can create disputes over water, for example in many areas where land is leased

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.160
 They are already suffering from a lack of water.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.990
 To ensure the water supply to its citizens, (Saudi Arabia) is investing heavily in

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.439
 Seawater desalination

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:30.070
 It is now the largest producer of desalinated water in the world.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.800
 For example, most of the water is pumped into (Medina) from the desalination plant

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.270
 Located on the "red sea"

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.780
 Drinking water in the capital (Riyadh) comes mainly from the (Jubail) desalination plant.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:49.639
 On the ("Persian Gulf"), at a distance of 500 kilometers or about 310 miles, where it is pumped internally through the pipeline.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.020
 As of January 2019, it produces around 1.4 million cubic meters of water

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.460
 in a day

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.499
 The water supply in (Saudi Arabia) is heavily subsidized.

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.870
 The government commissioned a number of private companies from all over the world

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.659
 For these stations.

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.240
 In order to keep costs down for the consumer, the government buys water from these companies

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.729
 She sells it to families for a much lower price.

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.590
 There are efforts to increase these home pricing in order to create more incentives

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.249
 To rationalize water consumption.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.349
 But tariff increases are not uncommon, and the last time tariffs were raised in 2016,

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.860
 The price hike caused an uproar, and he was eventually replaced by the "Minister of Water".

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.580
 A common way to desalinate sea water is through thermal desalination.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.230
 There are a number of different technical processes here but they are basically accomplished

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.139
 By boiling the water and thus separating it from the "salt".

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:55.210
 The other, more energy-efficient method is desalination through "reverse osmosis".

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.420
 In "reverse osmosis", sea water is compressed and forced to pass through a membrane

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.900
 Only water molecules are allowed in, thus separating them from the "salt".

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.690
 Currently, about half of the drinking water production comes from desalination.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.050
 But although desalination appears reasonable, there are a number of disadvantages to it.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.240
 Especially in terms of its impact on the environment.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.889
 A side effect of the brine desalination process is "heavy salt concentration".

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:26.779
 The rest at the end after analysis

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.240
 This saltwater solution is usually returned to the ocean where it can cause environmental damage.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.379
 (Saudi Arabia) is able to desalinate large quantities of water because it can produce the energy required for that

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.800
 Using "fossil fuels."

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.560
 In "thermal desalination", "fossil fuels" are used to generate the necessary heat

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.400
 In “reverse osmosis”, the electricity needed is largely produced using “natural gas”.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.349
 Hence, these approaches are not sustainable approaches to solving the water problem.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:08:00.550
 Hence, (Saudi Arabia is also investing) in solar powered stations, such as

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.219
 The largest station in the world is in (Khafji).

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:07.110
 But the country still relies heavily on "fossil fuels" and fossil (groundwater) waters.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.419
 The importance of finding sustainable solutions to these enormous challenges is demonstrated in

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.640
 Depletion of "groundwater" levels in previous decades.
